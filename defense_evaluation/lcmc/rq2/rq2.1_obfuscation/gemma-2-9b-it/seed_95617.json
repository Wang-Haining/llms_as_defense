            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It's my opinion that the Catholic Church could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. There's been discussion about the Church losing members, and I believe this decline may be partly due to its lack of inclusivity on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.\n\nWhile the Church has strong convictions on these topics, which is understandable, some of its views seem outdated in today's society. If the Church were to embrace a more contemporary perspective, it might see a renewed sense of engagement from its followers. \n\nI've heard concerns from individuals who are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these sensitive subjects.  People are increasingly seeking a faith community that aligns with their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFor example, a person who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's condemned, or someone who believes in same-sex marriage might feel alienated by the Church's opposition. \n\nI personally think allowing female priests and permitting married priests would be positive changes. However, it's difficult to say definitively if these reforms would have prevented past scandals.  \n\nThe Church's doctrine states that priests are dedicated to God, but I see no reason why they couldn't also have fulfilling family lives. Most people in the world balance their professional commitments with their personal relationships, and I believe priests should have that same opportunity.",
            "I believe that everyone should have the right to marry, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice; people are born with certain inclinations.  Therefore, it seems unfair to deny someone the right to marry simply because of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't deeply explored the legal and philosophical complexities of same-sex marriage, I firmly believe that government shouldn't dictate who can and cannot marry.  Marriage is a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring equal rights and protections for all citizens.  \n\nUltimately,  it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and that includes recognizing the fundamental right to love and commit to another person.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a topic that demands careful consideration.  While some argue that allowing gay couples to marry threatens the traditional family structure, this perspective overlooks the fundamental differences between relationships and the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and commitment.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not solely a religious institution.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry based on religious beliefs raises concerns about the separation of church and state.  If civil unions are accepted, extending the full legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples seems like a logical and equitable step. \n\nThere are compelling arguments supporting this position.  Scientific research has shown that same-sex relationships exhibit similar patterns of success and satisfaction as heterosexual relationships.  Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry can have serious consequences for their families and well-being.  For instance, in healthcare settings, legal partners may be denied visitation rights, highlighting the importance of legal recognition for these relationships. \n\nConcerns regarding the impact of same-sex parents on their children have also been raised.  However, evidence suggests that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  It is essential to base our understanding on factual data rather than unfounded prejudices.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness.  Treating all individuals and couples with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, is fundamental to a just and inclusive society.  It is time to move beyond outdated notions and embrace a more equitable future where all couples have the right to legal recognition and the same benefits and protections.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer gave me a unique perspective on the legality versus medicinal value of certain substances. Observing firsthand how controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used responsibly for their therapeutic benefits made me consider the double standard surrounding marijuana. \n\nWhile I understand the concerns regarding public accessibility, I believe restricting its use solely based on its legal status is misguided. \n\nJust because a substance is illegal doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal properties.  Many substances with proven medical benefits have faced legal challenges in the past.  \n\nIt's crucial to approach this issue with a balanced perspective.  While acknowledging the potential for abuse, we should also recognize the potential benefits of marijuana for medical purposes.  Perhaps a gradual integration, similar to the controlled distribution of other pharmaceuticals, could mitigate concerns while allowing for responsible use.\n\nThe negative stigma associated with marijuana often overshadows its potential benefits.  Similar to alcohol, which can be harmful if abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, could be a valuable tool in managing certain medical conditions.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that by removing the taboo surrounding marijuana and fostering open, informed discussions, we can create a more nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and risks.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has definitely adapted to the modern era. It's certainly less rigid than it once was.  I can personally recall my childhood, attending church every Sunday in my Sunday best - complete with a matching dress, shoes, and purse. It was a regular part of my life, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my friends there on the weekends.  \n\nHowever, things have changed.  As I've gotten older, the church has implemented a special Mass geared towards teenagers, cutting it down to a more manageable thirty minutes. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. It's not uncommon to see families arrive straight from the beach, still in their swimwear. Even at the morning Masses, where I used to always dress up, I now see people in jeans and khakis.  It's definitely become more relaxed.\n\nWhile I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this shift towards a more casual atmosphere is the most noticeable change I've observed.\n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I think it's a complex issue.  I don't believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these tragedies.  Pedophilia isn't limited to any one profession or circumstance.  \n\nIt's a deeply personal issue rooted in an individual's nature, and, unfortunately, some individuals may be predisposed to these harmful behaviors regardless of their marital status or religious calling.  There are religions that allow married clergy, but that doesn't mean those individuals are immune to these issues.   \n\nIf someone truly desires to practice their faith while also being married, they might consider exploring other denominations that allow for this.  It's ultimately a personal choice.\n\nI realize this is a sensitive topic, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers.  It's a tragedy that these events have occurred, and my hope is that the church will continue to address these issues with transparency and accountability.",
            "The initial concept, while not initially objectionable, was overshadowed by the lingering impact of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the lead-up to the Iraq War was marked by several justifications, some of which have since been proven inaccurate.  \n\nThe Bush administration's early connection of the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, along with the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, has deeply troubled me.  These claims, now demonstrably false, raise serious concerns about the administration's transparency with the American public.  \n\nEven prominent figures like Colin Powell, who delivered a significant presentation at the United Nations, have expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the time.  This, to me, constitutes a serious breach of public trust, potentially even an impeachable offense.  \n\nThere's a perception that the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards military action, as evidenced by the assertions made by former Treasury Secretary [Name redacted] in his book following his departure from office.  \n\nThe younger Bush seemed to carry a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, potentially stemming from his father's administration's dealings with Iraq.  Furthermore, the pursuit of expanded energy resources appears to have been a motivating factor, which is a highly questionable approach.  \n\nThe prolonged duration of the conflict necessitates a delicate withdrawal strategy.  An abrupt departure risks plunging the country into civil war, resulting in further casualties.  \n\nThe proposed solution involving a coalition of regional nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order raises its own concerns.  Long-term implications for Iraq's sovereignty are unclear, as the interim government appears to be disintegrating. \n\nThe Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the limited control exerted by the Prime Minister, whose name escapes me, contribute to a volatile political climate.  The rise of figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, who now holds significant parliamentary seats, further complicates the situation.  \n\nThe current political landscape is characterized by internal strife and a struggle for power among various factions.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivations behind the conflict, such as responding to the tragic events of September 11th, I question the continued necessity of our involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legal and ethical implications of our military presence. Furthermore, the stated goals of establishing democracy and securing oil resources seem to be at odds with the reality on the ground. \n\nThe process of building a stable democracy in Iraq is a long and challenging undertaking, and the current situation appears to be exacerbating existing divisions within the country. The potential for unintended consequences, such as fueling further instability and anti-American sentiment, is a serious concern.\n\nIt is essential to consider the human cost of this conflict, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The ongoing violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on Iraqi society, while the sacrifices made by our troops should not be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq, coupled with a renewed focus on diplomatic solutions, is the most responsible path forward. This would allow for a more peaceful resolution to the conflict and minimize further bloodshed.",
            "The issue of [mention the specific issue being discussed] presents a complex dilemma. My personal stance is grounded in the fundamental principle of separation of church and state, as enshrined in our Constitution. This separation is crucial to ensuring religious freedom and preventing the imposition of one religious viewpoint over others.  \n\nAttempting to legislate on this matter, particularly through an amendment, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of this core principle.  It would essentially grant the government the authority to dictate religious practices, which I believe is inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nFurthermore, such an action could be perceived as favoring certain religious beliefs over others, creating division and potentially undermining the very fabric of religious tolerance that our nation was founded upon. \n\nI believe the decision regarding [mention the specific issue] should remain within the purview of individual religious institutions, allowing for diverse interpretations and practices without government interference.",
            "The conflict in Iraq presents a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency, with attempts to link it to the September 11th attacks, despite their tenuous connection. This manipulation of public sentiment, fueled by the nation's grief and anger, ultimately led to the commencement of hostilities in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I hold a strong anti-war stance, particularly regarding preemptive strikes. The Iraqi conflict echoes historical precedents like the Vietnam War, highlighting the government's failure to learn from past mistakes. The immense loss of American lives, coupled with the unforeseen consequences of regime change, underscores the gravity of this situation.\n\nThe removal of the Iraqi government without a comprehensive plan for the ensuing power vacuum resulted in chaos and instability. The attempt to establish a democratic system in Iraq, reminiscent of the endeavors in Vietnam, proved to be a protracted and arduous process.   \n\nThe complexities of nation-building, as exemplified by our own nation's historical struggles, demonstrate that establishing a stable and prosperous democracy is a lengthy and challenging undertaking.  \n\nThe administration's portrayal of a swift and successful intervention proved to be overly optimistic. The prolonged conflict, with its ongoing American casualties and the continued training of Iraqi security forces, raises crucial questions about the feasibility and ethical implications of our involvement.\n\nThe imperative to fulfill our commitments to the Iraqi people while weighing the escalating human and financial costs presents a formidable dilemma. The lack of clarity regarding the original objectives and the ongoing presence of oil interests further complicate the situation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the stated reasons for intervention and the reality on the ground, particularly the absence of weapons of mass destruction as initially claimed, casts doubt on the government's transparency and decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, the path forward remains uncertain. My hope is for a swift and peaceful resolution that brings stability and prosperity to Iraq while minimizing further loss of life.",
            "I firmly support marriage equality. This has been a deeply held belief for me. I see it as a matter of personal choice, something increasingly understood to have biological roots rather than solely sociological influences. \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control feels profoundly wrong. It's inhumane to restrict someone's fundamental freedoms due to their sexual orientation. I've always advocated for equal rights for all, including the right to marry.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage should be a private matter, a decision made between individuals and their families. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live fulfilling lives, raising families and contributing to their community, even though they lack legal recognition.\n\nThe notion that any individual or institution, especially the government, should define or control who can marry is troubling. It's a matter of personal autonomy and should remain a private affair. \n\nScientific research increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis, potentially influenced by factors like genetics and brain chemistry. This further underscores the importance of respecting individual choices and recognizing that sexual orientation is not a choice.\n\nThe contrast between the ease with which heterosexual couples can marry and the societal scrutiny faced by same-sex couples highlights the inherent inequality. Marriage should be a universally accessible right, free from public interference and legal barriers. It should be a celebration of love and commitment, not a subject for political debate or societal judgment.",
            "The nature of the internet necessitates an understanding of its public accessibility.  Once information is shared online, it becomes broadly visible, potentially influencing others' perceptions. This reality carries significant implications, especially when discussing sensitive topics. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. Sharing potentially concerning content, such as threats or violent language, can lead to serious repercussions. While it's important to remember that not all online expressions are intended maliciously, the potential for misinterpretation exists.  \n\nSchool officials, tasked with ensuring student safety, must act upon credible threats, even if they originate from online platforms.  A recent incident at my school illustrates this point. A seemingly innocuous online post, when viewed in the context of other information, raised concerns about a student's intentions.  \n\nThe key takeaway is that online content, shared in public forums, carries a degree of permanence and visibility.  Individuals must be mindful of the potential impact of their online presence, understanding that what they share can be accessed and interpreted by a wide audience.  \n\nWhile I believe there are ethical boundaries regarding school officials' access to student online activity,  the safety and well-being of the student body must ultimately take precedence.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial aim of restoring democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. It feels as though we're now engaged in the conflict solely to project an image of global dominance.  \n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's inception.  The personal history between former President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein casts a shadow of doubt on the purely altruistic nature of the conflict. If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a nation in need, that would be a justifiable cause. However, the presence of any personal agendas would undermine the legitimacy of the war.\n\nDespite achieving a decisive initial impact with the war's commencement, the prolonged conflict, spanning several years, has become excessive.  \n\nThe notion of promoting democracy through military intervention initially seemed reasonable, but I fear that our objectives have become muddled and misplaced. It appears we are now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than focusing on the original goals. \n\nThis extended conflict has exacted a heavy toll on our economy. Billions of dollars are being poured into a war that seems to have lost its purpose, money that could be better allocated to addressing pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and public services. \n\nThe fact that we are sacrificing the lives of our citizens in a foreign land for a cause that has become increasingly unclear is deeply troubling. It's time to recognize that the war has run its course and to focus our resources on the needs of our own nation.",
            "The concept of privacy online is a complex one. While sharing information on platforms like Myspace might seem like making it public, there are nuances to consider. A user chooses who they allow to view their profile, essentially granting permission to those they deem \"friends.\" However, the vast reach of the internet means that even seemingly private information can be accessed by unintended parties. \n\nThe ethical implications of monitoring student profiles raise concerns about potential discrimination and the invasion of privacy. While the desire to ensure student safety is understandable, assigning someone the task of scrutinizing every profile seems impractical and potentially harmful. It's crucial to balance safety concerns with individual freedoms.\n\nPersonally, I've experienced the unsettling feeling of encountering strangers who seem to know an excessive amount about me through platforms like Facebook.  Stories of individuals exploiting online information for malicious purposes highlight the potential dangers. It's a constant struggle to maintain a balance between online connectivity and personal security.\n\nThe incident involving a high school banning Myspace usage is particularly thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions can regulate students' online activities. While the school might have had safety concerns, it's debatable whether outright bans are an effective or ethical solution. Ultimately, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online behavior are crucial for navigating the complexities of online privacy.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift towards the current realities and potential future outcomes. \n\nGlobal sentiment, as evidenced by numerous polls, overwhelmingly condemns the war.  A significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and even U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this view.  The war has demonstrably destabilized the region, and the prospect of withdrawal, while challenging, may be the least detrimental option. \n\nThe cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East create significant obstacles to achieving lasting peace and stability.  Democratization efforts, while well-intentioned, may be ill-suited to the region's unique context.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been meticulously weighed against the potential consequences, which have proven to be catastrophic. The current situation resembles quicksand, making any foreseeable resolution fraught with difficulty.\n\nA gradual withdrawal, spanning a year or slightly longer, might be more manageable than an immediate departure. However, the Iraqi people's desire for our withdrawal, as expressed in polls, should be seriously considered.  \n\nUltimately, the question remains: what path offers the best chance for a positive outcome, both for Iraq and for the United States? Perhaps the most ethical approach is to respect the Iraqi people's wishes and allow them to chart their own future, even if it means accepting the inherent risks involved.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, extending beyond the experiences of women. While strides have been made towards equality, certain industries and societal expectations continue to present challenges. \n\nFor instance, women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering obstacles in advancing to leadership positions despite possessing the necessary qualifications. This bias stems from historical perceptions of women's roles in the business world. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents may face societal disapproval, as traditional gender roles often associate financial provision with masculinity.\n\nMoreover, the fashion industry presents a unique dynamic where men's expertise may be questioned based on stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nUltimately, societal norms and ingrained biases contribute to these forms of discrimination. While progress has been made, dismantling these deeply rooted attitudes requires a continuous effort to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that discrimination can manifest in various forms, extending beyond gender to encompass factors such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with various perspectives. While some argue that decriminalization, which reduces it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, is a step in the right direction, others believe it doesn't address the underlying concerns. \n\nOne key argument for decriminalization is the financial burden associated with arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. This process can be costly for municipalities, especially those facing financial challenges. \n\nProponents of decriminalization also point out that it can free up resources for other essential services, such as public education, social programs, and support for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some remain opposed to decriminalization due to concerns about its potential impact on public health and safety. They worry that increased accessibility could lead to more widespread use, including driving under the influence, and contribute to societal norms that normalize marijuana use.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to decriminalize marijuana involves weighing various factors, including public health, safety, financial considerations, and ethical concerns. It's a multifaceted debate that requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of the potential consequences.",
            "I would agree that the Catholic Church has a strong foundation in tradition. The enduring nature of their practices speaks to their commitment to their beliefs. However, I also believe that any institution, especially one as influential as the Church, must be open to adapting to the changing world. \n\nThere are aspects of Catholic doctrine that I find problematic. The emphasis on strict adherence to rules and the judgment of those who do not perfectly conform can feel exclusionary. This is particularly evident in their stance on interfaith marriage, as exemplified by my parents' experience. My father was Episcopalian, and my mother, a devout Catholic, was denied a Church wedding. This lack of acceptance of other faiths seems to contradict the core teaching of love and compassion that is central to Catholicism.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the Church's resistance to change, particularly regarding issues like allowing priests to marry, is outdated and hinders their ability to connect with a modern audience. While I understand the concerns about potential abuses, I believe that personal choices and human nature are complex and cannot be solely attributed to marital status.  \n\nUltimately, I feel a disconnect between the ideals espoused by the Church and the practices that often contradict them.",
            "The issue of marriage equality presents a complex dilemma. Balancing the principles of separation of church and state with the social and legal recognition of different relationship structures is a delicate task.  \n\nDefining marriage, particularly in the context of same-sex unions, raises profound questions.  Should the government, which traditionally doesn't intervene in religious matters like baptism,  become involved in defining and regulating a civil union that has religious significance for some?  \n\nIt seems logical to view marriage as primarily a civil contract, recognizing the commitment between two individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't grant special tax benefits or legal status based on religious affiliation, it shouldn't differentiate between marital unions based on the religious ceremony.\n\nIf states can reach a consensus on a fair and equitable approach to marriage equality, then federal legislation should reflect those shared values.  However, amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems an extreme and unnecessary measure. While this issue is deeply important to many, it doesn't warrant such a drastic constitutional change.  The Constitution should be preserved for matters of fundamental rights and liberties, not for regulating social norms.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my perspective on homosexuality is complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully align with that lifestyle. However, I believe in the fundamental right for individuals to choose their own paths and advocate for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nI think this issue is best handled at the state level rather than imposed nationally.  The United States is diverse, with varying political leanings and societal values. Democratic-leaning states are likely to be more progressive on issues like same-sex marriage, while Republican-leaning states may hold different views. \n\nIndividuals choose where they reside, and I believe they should respect the laws and social norms of the state they call home. If a state legalizes gay marriage, those living there should accept that as the prevailing stance within their community.\n\nUltimately, I support equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nThe federal government should not dictate social policies that are best decided at the state level.  A president, even one with strong personal beliefs, shouldn't impose a national stance on such a sensitive and multifaceted issue.  The ideal solution is to allow each state to determine its own approach, fostering a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse viewpoints can be accommodated.",
            "School officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students.  While the concept of privacy is important,  it's crucial to weigh that against the potential for harm.  Social media platforms like MySpace, being publicly accessible, inherently carry the risk of content being viewed by anyone, including school officials.  \n\nIf school officials become aware of something on a student's profile that raises concerns about their safety or the safety of others, it's understandable why they would investigate.  Preventing tragedies like Columbine should be a top priority, and if accessing a student's public profile helps achieve that goal, it's a justifiable action.  \n\nIt's important to remember that actions online have consequences, just like actions in the real world.  Students should be mindful of what they share publicly, as it can have unintended repercussions.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I strongly supported military action in response to the attacks, fueled by a desire for retribution. Looking back, however, I believe the emotional climate at the time overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences.\n\nOur involvement in the conflict feels like a hasty decision, lacking a comprehensive plan and adequate preparation. I've come to believe that our presence has not achieved the desired results and may even have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe internal conflicts within the region seem to be a significant obstacle to stability. It's difficult to assess how our involvement truly contributes to progress when factions are deeply divided amongst themselves. \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now question whether military intervention was the most effective approach.\n\nThe realities of conflict in that region differ drastically from our own experiences.  What we perceive as progress may not align with the aspirations of the local population.  Perhaps a more diplomatic and collaborative strategy would have been more fruitful."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It's my opinion that the Catholic Church could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. There's been discussion about the Church losing members, and I believe this decline may be partly due to its lack of inclusivity on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.\n\nWhile the Church has strong convictions on these topics, which is understandable, some of its views seem outdated in today's society. If the Church were to embrace a more contemporary perspective, it might see a renewed sense of engagement from its followers. \n\nI've heard concerns from individuals who are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these sensitive subjects.  People are increasingly seeking a faith community that aligns with their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFor example, a person who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's condemned, or someone who believes in same-sex marriage might feel alienated by the Church's opposition. \n\nI personally think allowing female priests and permitting married priests would be positive changes. However, it's difficult to say definitively if these reforms would have prevented past scandals.  \n\nThe Church's doctrine states that priests are dedicated to God, but I see no reason why they couldn't also have fulfilling family lives. Most people in the world balance their professional commitments with their personal relationships, and I believe priests should have that same opportunity.",
            "I believe that everyone should have the right to marry, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice; people are born with certain inclinations.  Therefore, it seems unfair to deny someone the right to marry simply because of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't deeply explored the legal and philosophical complexities of same-sex marriage, I firmly believe that government shouldn't dictate who can and cannot marry.  Marriage is a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring equal rights and protections for all citizens.  \n\nUltimately,  it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and that includes recognizing the fundamental right to love and commit to another person.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a topic that demands careful consideration.  While some argue that allowing gay couples to marry threatens the traditional family structure, this perspective overlooks the fundamental differences between relationships and the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and commitment.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not solely a religious institution.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry based on religious beliefs raises concerns about the separation of church and state.  If civil unions are accepted, extending the full legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples seems like a logical and equitable step. \n\nThere are compelling arguments supporting this position.  Scientific research has shown that same-sex relationships exhibit similar patterns of success and satisfaction as heterosexual relationships.  Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry can have serious consequences for their families and well-being.  For instance, in healthcare settings, legal partners may be denied visitation rights, highlighting the importance of legal recognition for these relationships. \n\nConcerns regarding the impact of same-sex parents on their children have also been raised.  However, evidence suggests that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  It is essential to base our understanding on factual data rather than unfounded prejudices.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness.  Treating all individuals and couples with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, is fundamental to a just and inclusive society.  It is time to move beyond outdated notions and embrace a more equitable future where all couples have the right to legal recognition and the same benefits and protections.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer gave me a unique perspective on the legality versus medicinal value of certain substances. Observing firsthand how controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used responsibly for their therapeutic benefits made me consider the double standard surrounding marijuana. \n\nWhile I understand the concerns regarding public accessibility, I believe restricting its use solely based on its legal status is misguided. \n\nJust because a substance is illegal doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal properties.  Many substances with proven medical benefits have faced legal challenges in the past.  \n\nIt's crucial to approach this issue with a balanced perspective.  While acknowledging the potential for abuse, we should also recognize the potential benefits of marijuana for medical purposes.  Perhaps a gradual integration, similar to the controlled distribution of other pharmaceuticals, could mitigate concerns while allowing for responsible use.\n\nThe negative stigma associated with marijuana often overshadows its potential benefits.  Similar to alcohol, which can be harmful if abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, could be a valuable tool in managing certain medical conditions.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that by removing the taboo surrounding marijuana and fostering open, informed discussions, we can create a more nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and risks.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has definitely adapted to the modern era. It's certainly less rigid than it once was.  I can personally recall my childhood, attending church every Sunday in my Sunday best - complete with a matching dress, shoes, and purse. It was a regular part of my life, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my friends there on the weekends.  \n\nHowever, things have changed.  As I've gotten older, the church has implemented a special Mass geared towards teenagers, cutting it down to a more manageable thirty minutes. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. It's not uncommon to see families arrive straight from the beach, still in their swimwear. Even at the morning Masses, where I used to always dress up, I now see people in jeans and khakis.  It's definitely become more relaxed.\n\nWhile I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this shift towards a more casual atmosphere is the most noticeable change I've observed.\n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I think it's a complex issue.  I don't believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these tragedies.  Pedophilia isn't limited to any one profession or circumstance.  \n\nIt's a deeply personal issue rooted in an individual's nature, and, unfortunately, some individuals may be predisposed to these harmful behaviors regardless of their marital status or religious calling.  There are religions that allow married clergy, but that doesn't mean those individuals are immune to these issues.   \n\nIf someone truly desires to practice their faith while also being married, they might consider exploring other denominations that allow for this.  It's ultimately a personal choice.\n\nI realize this is a sensitive topic, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers.  It's a tragedy that these events have occurred, and my hope is that the church will continue to address these issues with transparency and accountability.",
            "The initial concept, while not initially objectionable, was overshadowed by the lingering impact of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the lead-up to the Iraq War was marked by several justifications, some of which have since been proven inaccurate.  \n\nThe Bush administration's early connection of the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, along with the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, has deeply troubled me.  These claims, now demonstrably false, raise serious concerns about the administration's transparency with the American public.  \n\nEven prominent figures like Colin Powell, who delivered a significant presentation at the United Nations, have expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the time.  This, to me, constitutes a serious breach of public trust, potentially even an impeachable offense.  \n\nThere's a perception that the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards military action, as evidenced by the assertions made by former Treasury Secretary [Name redacted] in his book following his departure from office.  \n\nThe younger Bush seemed to carry a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, potentially stemming from his father's administration's dealings with Iraq.  Furthermore, the pursuit of expanded energy resources appears to have been a motivating factor, which is a highly questionable approach.  \n\nThe prolonged duration of the conflict necessitates a delicate withdrawal strategy.  An abrupt departure risks plunging the country into civil war, resulting in further casualties.  \n\nThe proposed solution involving a coalition of regional nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order raises its own concerns.  Long-term implications for Iraq's sovereignty are unclear, as the interim government appears to be disintegrating. \n\nThe Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the limited control exerted by the Prime Minister, whose name escapes me, contribute to a volatile political climate.  The rise of figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, who now holds significant parliamentary seats, further complicates the situation.  \n\nThe current political landscape is characterized by internal strife and a struggle for power among various factions.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivations behind the conflict, such as responding to the tragic events of September 11th, I question the continued necessity of our involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legal and ethical implications of our military presence. Furthermore, the stated goals of establishing democracy and securing oil resources seem to be at odds with the reality on the ground. \n\nThe process of building a stable democracy in Iraq is a long and challenging undertaking, and the current situation appears to be exacerbating existing divisions within the country. The potential for unintended consequences, such as fueling further instability and anti-American sentiment, is a serious concern.\n\nIt is essential to consider the human cost of this conflict, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The ongoing violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on Iraqi society, while the sacrifices made by our troops should not be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq, coupled with a renewed focus on diplomatic solutions, is the most responsible path forward. This would allow for a more peaceful resolution to the conflict and minimize further bloodshed.",
            "The issue of [mention the specific issue being discussed] presents a complex dilemma. My personal stance is grounded in the fundamental principle of separation of church and state, as enshrined in our Constitution. This separation is crucial to ensuring religious freedom and preventing the imposition of one religious viewpoint over others.  \n\nAttempting to legislate on this matter, particularly through an amendment, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of this core principle.  It would essentially grant the government the authority to dictate religious practices, which I believe is inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nFurthermore, such an action could be perceived as favoring certain religious beliefs over others, creating division and potentially undermining the very fabric of religious tolerance that our nation was founded upon. \n\nI believe the decision regarding [mention the specific issue] should remain within the purview of individual religious institutions, allowing for diverse interpretations and practices without government interference.",
            "The conflict in Iraq presents a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency, with attempts to link it to the September 11th attacks, despite their tenuous connection. This manipulation of public sentiment, fueled by the nation's grief and anger, ultimately led to the commencement of hostilities in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I hold a strong anti-war stance, particularly regarding preemptive strikes. The Iraqi conflict echoes historical precedents like the Vietnam War, highlighting the government's failure to learn from past mistakes. The immense loss of American lives, coupled with the unforeseen consequences of regime change, underscores the gravity of this situation.\n\nThe removal of the Iraqi government without a comprehensive plan for the ensuing power vacuum resulted in chaos and instability. The attempt to establish a democratic system in Iraq, reminiscent of the endeavors in Vietnam, proved to be a protracted and arduous process.   \n\nThe complexities of nation-building, as exemplified by our own nation's historical struggles, demonstrate that establishing a stable and prosperous democracy is a lengthy and challenging undertaking.  \n\nThe administration's portrayal of a swift and successful intervention proved to be overly optimistic. The prolonged conflict, with its ongoing American casualties and the continued training of Iraqi security forces, raises crucial questions about the feasibility and ethical implications of our involvement.\n\nThe imperative to fulfill our commitments to the Iraqi people while weighing the escalating human and financial costs presents a formidable dilemma. The lack of clarity regarding the original objectives and the ongoing presence of oil interests further complicate the situation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the stated reasons for intervention and the reality on the ground, particularly the absence of weapons of mass destruction as initially claimed, casts doubt on the government's transparency and decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, the path forward remains uncertain. My hope is for a swift and peaceful resolution that brings stability and prosperity to Iraq while minimizing further loss of life.",
            "I firmly support marriage equality. This has been a deeply held belief for me. I see it as a matter of personal choice, something increasingly understood to have biological roots rather than solely sociological influences. \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control feels profoundly wrong. It's inhumane to restrict someone's fundamental freedoms due to their sexual orientation. I've always advocated for equal rights for all, including the right to marry.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage should be a private matter, a decision made between individuals and their families. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live fulfilling lives, raising families and contributing to their community, even though they lack legal recognition.\n\nThe notion that any individual or institution, especially the government, should define or control who can marry is troubling. It's a matter of personal autonomy and should remain a private affair. \n\nScientific research increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis, potentially influenced by factors like genetics and brain chemistry. This further underscores the importance of respecting individual choices and recognizing that sexual orientation is not a choice.\n\nThe contrast between the ease with which heterosexual couples can marry and the societal scrutiny faced by same-sex couples highlights the inherent inequality. Marriage should be a universally accessible right, free from public interference and legal barriers. It should be a celebration of love and commitment, not a subject for political debate or societal judgment.",
            "The nature of the internet necessitates an understanding of its public accessibility.  Once information is shared online, it becomes broadly visible, potentially influencing others' perceptions. This reality carries significant implications, especially when discussing sensitive topics. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. Sharing potentially concerning content, such as threats or violent language, can lead to serious repercussions. While it's important to remember that not all online expressions are intended maliciously, the potential for misinterpretation exists.  \n\nSchool officials, tasked with ensuring student safety, must act upon credible threats, even if they originate from online platforms.  A recent incident at my school illustrates this point. A seemingly innocuous online post, when viewed in the context of other information, raised concerns about a student's intentions.  \n\nThe key takeaway is that online content, shared in public forums, carries a degree of permanence and visibility.  Individuals must be mindful of the potential impact of their online presence, understanding that what they share can be accessed and interpreted by a wide audience.  \n\nWhile I believe there are ethical boundaries regarding school officials' access to student online activity,  the safety and well-being of the student body must ultimately take precedence.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial aim of restoring democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. It feels as though we're now engaged in the conflict solely to project an image of global dominance.  \n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's inception.  The personal history between former President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein casts a shadow of doubt on the purely altruistic nature of the conflict. If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a nation in need, that would be a justifiable cause. However, the presence of any personal agendas would undermine the legitimacy of the war.\n\nDespite achieving a decisive initial impact with the war's commencement, the prolonged conflict, spanning several years, has become excessive.  \n\nThe notion of promoting democracy through military intervention initially seemed reasonable, but I fear that our objectives have become muddled and misplaced. It appears we are now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than focusing on the original goals. \n\nThis extended conflict has exacted a heavy toll on our economy. Billions of dollars are being poured into a war that seems to have lost its purpose, money that could be better allocated to addressing pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and public services. \n\nThe fact that we are sacrificing the lives of our citizens in a foreign land for a cause that has become increasingly unclear is deeply troubling. It's time to recognize that the war has run its course and to focus our resources on the needs of our own nation.",
            "The concept of privacy online is a complex one. While sharing information on platforms like Myspace might seem like making it public, there are nuances to consider. A user chooses who they allow to view their profile, essentially granting permission to those they deem \"friends.\" However, the vast reach of the internet means that even seemingly private information can be accessed by unintended parties. \n\nThe ethical implications of monitoring student profiles raise concerns about potential discrimination and the invasion of privacy. While the desire to ensure student safety is understandable, assigning someone the task of scrutinizing every profile seems impractical and potentially harmful. It's crucial to balance safety concerns with individual freedoms.\n\nPersonally, I've experienced the unsettling feeling of encountering strangers who seem to know an excessive amount about me through platforms like Facebook.  Stories of individuals exploiting online information for malicious purposes highlight the potential dangers. It's a constant struggle to maintain a balance between online connectivity and personal security.\n\nThe incident involving a high school banning Myspace usage is particularly thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions can regulate students' online activities. While the school might have had safety concerns, it's debatable whether outright bans are an effective or ethical solution. Ultimately, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online behavior are crucial for navigating the complexities of online privacy.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift towards the current realities and potential future outcomes. \n\nGlobal sentiment, as evidenced by numerous polls, overwhelmingly condemns the war.  A significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and even U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this view.  The war has demonstrably destabilized the region, and the prospect of withdrawal, while challenging, may be the least detrimental option. \n\nThe cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East create significant obstacles to achieving lasting peace and stability.  Democratization efforts, while well-intentioned, may be ill-suited to the region's unique context.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been meticulously weighed against the potential consequences, which have proven to be catastrophic. The current situation resembles quicksand, making any foreseeable resolution fraught with difficulty.\n\nA gradual withdrawal, spanning a year or slightly longer, might be more manageable than an immediate departure. However, the Iraqi people's desire for our withdrawal, as expressed in polls, should be seriously considered.  \n\nUltimately, the question remains: what path offers the best chance for a positive outcome, both for Iraq and for the United States? Perhaps the most ethical approach is to respect the Iraqi people's wishes and allow them to chart their own future, even if it means accepting the inherent risks involved.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, extending beyond the experiences of women. While strides have been made towards equality, certain industries and societal expectations continue to present challenges. \n\nFor instance, women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering obstacles in advancing to leadership positions despite possessing the necessary qualifications. This bias stems from historical perceptions of women's roles in the business world. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents may face societal disapproval, as traditional gender roles often associate financial provision with masculinity.\n\nMoreover, the fashion industry presents a unique dynamic where men's expertise may be questioned based on stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nUltimately, societal norms and ingrained biases contribute to these forms of discrimination. While progress has been made, dismantling these deeply rooted attitudes requires a continuous effort to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that discrimination can manifest in various forms, extending beyond gender to encompass factors such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with various perspectives. While some argue that decriminalization, which reduces it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, is a step in the right direction, others believe it doesn't address the underlying concerns. \n\nOne key argument for decriminalization is the financial burden associated with arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. This process can be costly for municipalities, especially those facing financial challenges. \n\nProponents of decriminalization also point out that it can free up resources for other essential services, such as public education, social programs, and support for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some remain opposed to decriminalization due to concerns about its potential impact on public health and safety. They worry that increased accessibility could lead to more widespread use, including driving under the influence, and contribute to societal norms that normalize marijuana use.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to decriminalize marijuana involves weighing various factors, including public health, safety, financial considerations, and ethical concerns. It's a multifaceted debate that requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of the potential consequences.",
            "I would agree that the Catholic Church has a strong foundation in tradition. The enduring nature of their practices speaks to their commitment to their beliefs. However, I also believe that any institution, especially one as influential as the Church, must be open to adapting to the changing world. \n\nThere are aspects of Catholic doctrine that I find problematic. The emphasis on strict adherence to rules and the judgment of those who do not perfectly conform can feel exclusionary. This is particularly evident in their stance on interfaith marriage, as exemplified by my parents' experience. My father was Episcopalian, and my mother, a devout Catholic, was denied a Church wedding. This lack of acceptance of other faiths seems to contradict the core teaching of love and compassion that is central to Catholicism.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the Church's resistance to change, particularly regarding issues like allowing priests to marry, is outdated and hinders their ability to connect with a modern audience. While I understand the concerns about potential abuses, I believe that personal choices and human nature are complex and cannot be solely attributed to marital status.  \n\nUltimately, I feel a disconnect between the ideals espoused by the Church and the practices that often contradict them.",
            "The issue of marriage equality presents a complex dilemma. Balancing the principles of separation of church and state with the social and legal recognition of different relationship structures is a delicate task.  \n\nDefining marriage, particularly in the context of same-sex unions, raises profound questions.  Should the government, which traditionally doesn't intervene in religious matters like baptism,  become involved in defining and regulating a civil union that has religious significance for some?  \n\nIt seems logical to view marriage as primarily a civil contract, recognizing the commitment between two individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't grant special tax benefits or legal status based on religious affiliation, it shouldn't differentiate between marital unions based on the religious ceremony.\n\nIf states can reach a consensus on a fair and equitable approach to marriage equality, then federal legislation should reflect those shared values.  However, amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems an extreme and unnecessary measure. While this issue is deeply important to many, it doesn't warrant such a drastic constitutional change.  The Constitution should be preserved for matters of fundamental rights and liberties, not for regulating social norms.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my perspective on homosexuality is complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully align with that lifestyle. However, I believe in the fundamental right for individuals to choose their own paths and advocate for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nI think this issue is best handled at the state level rather than imposed nationally.  The United States is diverse, with varying political leanings and societal values. Democratic-leaning states are likely to be more progressive on issues like same-sex marriage, while Republican-leaning states may hold different views. \n\nIndividuals choose where they reside, and I believe they should respect the laws and social norms of the state they call home. If a state legalizes gay marriage, those living there should accept that as the prevailing stance within their community.\n\nUltimately, I support equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nThe federal government should not dictate social policies that are best decided at the state level.  A president, even one with strong personal beliefs, shouldn't impose a national stance on such a sensitive and multifaceted issue.  The ideal solution is to allow each state to determine its own approach, fostering a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse viewpoints can be accommodated.",
            "School officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students.  While the concept of privacy is important,  it's crucial to weigh that against the potential for harm.  Social media platforms like MySpace, being publicly accessible, inherently carry the risk of content being viewed by anyone, including school officials.  \n\nIf school officials become aware of something on a student's profile that raises concerns about their safety or the safety of others, it's understandable why they would investigate.  Preventing tragedies like Columbine should be a top priority, and if accessing a student's public profile helps achieve that goal, it's a justifiable action.  \n\nIt's important to remember that actions online have consequences, just like actions in the real world.  Students should be mindful of what they share publicly, as it can have unintended repercussions.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I strongly supported military action in response to the attacks, fueled by a desire for retribution. Looking back, however, I believe the emotional climate at the time overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences.\n\nOur involvement in the conflict feels like a hasty decision, lacking a comprehensive plan and adequate preparation. I've come to believe that our presence has not achieved the desired results and may even have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe internal conflicts within the region seem to be a significant obstacle to stability. It's difficult to assess how our involvement truly contributes to progress when factions are deeply divided amongst themselves. \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now question whether military intervention was the most effective approach.\n\nThe realities of conflict in that region differ drastically from our own experiences.  What we perceive as progress may not align with the aspirations of the local population.  Perhaps a more diplomatic and collaborative strategy would have been more fruitful."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It's my opinion that the Catholic Church could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. There's been discussion about the Church losing members, and I believe this decline may be partly due to its lack of inclusivity on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.\n\nWhile the Church has strong convictions on these topics, which is understandable, some of its views seem outdated in today's society. If the Church were to embrace a more contemporary perspective, it might see a renewed sense of engagement from its followers. \n\nI've heard concerns from individuals who are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these sensitive subjects.  People are increasingly seeking a faith community that aligns with their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFor example, a person who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's condemned, or someone who believes in same-sex marriage might feel alienated by the Church's opposition. \n\nI personally think allowing female priests and permitting married priests would be positive changes. However, it's difficult to say definitively if these reforms would have prevented past scandals.  \n\nThe Church's doctrine states that priests are dedicated to God, but I see no reason why they couldn't also have fulfilling family lives. Most people in the world balance their professional commitments with their personal relationships, and I believe priests should have that same opportunity.",
            "I believe that everyone should have the right to marry, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice; people are born with certain inclinations.  Therefore, it seems unfair to deny someone the right to marry simply because of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't deeply explored the legal and philosophical complexities of same-sex marriage, I firmly believe that government shouldn't dictate who can and cannot marry.  Marriage is a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring equal rights and protections for all citizens.  \n\nUltimately,  it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and that includes recognizing the fundamental right to love and commit to another person.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a topic that demands careful consideration.  While some argue that allowing gay couples to marry threatens the traditional family structure, this perspective overlooks the fundamental differences between relationships and the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and commitment.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not solely a religious institution.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry based on religious beliefs raises concerns about the separation of church and state.  If civil unions are accepted, extending the full legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples seems like a logical and equitable step. \n\nThere are compelling arguments supporting this position.  Scientific research has shown that same-sex relationships exhibit similar patterns of success and satisfaction as heterosexual relationships.  Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry can have serious consequences for their families and well-being.  For instance, in healthcare settings, legal partners may be denied visitation rights, highlighting the importance of legal recognition for these relationships. \n\nConcerns regarding the impact of same-sex parents on their children have also been raised.  However, evidence suggests that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  It is essential to base our understanding on factual data rather than unfounded prejudices.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness.  Treating all individuals and couples with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, is fundamental to a just and inclusive society.  It is time to move beyond outdated notions and embrace a more equitable future where all couples have the right to legal recognition and the same benefits and protections.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer gave me a unique perspective on the legality versus medicinal value of certain substances. Observing firsthand how controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used responsibly for their therapeutic benefits made me consider the double standard surrounding marijuana. \n\nWhile I understand the concerns regarding public accessibility, I believe restricting its use solely based on its legal status is misguided. \n\nJust because a substance is illegal doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal properties.  Many substances with proven medical benefits have faced legal challenges in the past.  \n\nIt's crucial to approach this issue with a balanced perspective.  While acknowledging the potential for abuse, we should also recognize the potential benefits of marijuana for medical purposes.  Perhaps a gradual integration, similar to the controlled distribution of other pharmaceuticals, could mitigate concerns while allowing for responsible use.\n\nThe negative stigma associated with marijuana often overshadows its potential benefits.  Similar to alcohol, which can be harmful if abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, could be a valuable tool in managing certain medical conditions.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that by removing the taboo surrounding marijuana and fostering open, informed discussions, we can create a more nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and risks.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has definitely adapted to the modern era. It's certainly less rigid than it once was.  I can personally recall my childhood, attending church every Sunday in my Sunday best - complete with a matching dress, shoes, and purse. It was a regular part of my life, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my friends there on the weekends.  \n\nHowever, things have changed.  As I've gotten older, the church has implemented a special Mass geared towards teenagers, cutting it down to a more manageable thirty minutes. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. It's not uncommon to see families arrive straight from the beach, still in their swimwear. Even at the morning Masses, where I used to always dress up, I now see people in jeans and khakis.  It's definitely become more relaxed.\n\nWhile I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this shift towards a more casual atmosphere is the most noticeable change I've observed.\n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I think it's a complex issue.  I don't believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these tragedies.  Pedophilia isn't limited to any one profession or circumstance.  \n\nIt's a deeply personal issue rooted in an individual's nature, and, unfortunately, some individuals may be predisposed to these harmful behaviors regardless of their marital status or religious calling.  There are religions that allow married clergy, but that doesn't mean those individuals are immune to these issues.   \n\nIf someone truly desires to practice their faith while also being married, they might consider exploring other denominations that allow for this.  It's ultimately a personal choice.\n\nI realize this is a sensitive topic, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers.  It's a tragedy that these events have occurred, and my hope is that the church will continue to address these issues with transparency and accountability.",
            "The initial concept, while not initially objectionable, was overshadowed by the lingering impact of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the lead-up to the Iraq War was marked by several justifications, some of which have since been proven inaccurate.  \n\nThe Bush administration's early connection of the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, along with the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, has deeply troubled me.  These claims, now demonstrably false, raise serious concerns about the administration's transparency with the American public.  \n\nEven prominent figures like Colin Powell, who delivered a significant presentation at the United Nations, have expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the time.  This, to me, constitutes a serious breach of public trust, potentially even an impeachable offense.  \n\nThere's a perception that the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards military action, as evidenced by the assertions made by former Treasury Secretary [Name redacted] in his book following his departure from office.  \n\nThe younger Bush seemed to carry a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, potentially stemming from his father's administration's dealings with Iraq.  Furthermore, the pursuit of expanded energy resources appears to have been a motivating factor, which is a highly questionable approach.  \n\nThe prolonged duration of the conflict necessitates a delicate withdrawal strategy.  An abrupt departure risks plunging the country into civil war, resulting in further casualties.  \n\nThe proposed solution involving a coalition of regional nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order raises its own concerns.  Long-term implications for Iraq's sovereignty are unclear, as the interim government appears to be disintegrating. \n\nThe Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the limited control exerted by the Prime Minister, whose name escapes me, contribute to a volatile political climate.  The rise of figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, who now holds significant parliamentary seats, further complicates the situation.  \n\nThe current political landscape is characterized by internal strife and a struggle for power among various factions.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivations behind the conflict, such as responding to the tragic events of September 11th, I question the continued necessity of our involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legal and ethical implications of our military presence. Furthermore, the stated goals of establishing democracy and securing oil resources seem to be at odds with the reality on the ground. \n\nThe process of building a stable democracy in Iraq is a long and challenging undertaking, and the current situation appears to be exacerbating existing divisions within the country. The potential for unintended consequences, such as fueling further instability and anti-American sentiment, is a serious concern.\n\nIt is essential to consider the human cost of this conflict, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The ongoing violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on Iraqi society, while the sacrifices made by our troops should not be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq, coupled with a renewed focus on diplomatic solutions, is the most responsible path forward. This would allow for a more peaceful resolution to the conflict and minimize further bloodshed.",
            "The issue of [mention the specific issue being discussed] presents a complex dilemma. My personal stance is grounded in the fundamental principle of separation of church and state, as enshrined in our Constitution. This separation is crucial to ensuring religious freedom and preventing the imposition of one religious viewpoint over others.  \n\nAttempting to legislate on this matter, particularly through an amendment, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of this core principle.  It would essentially grant the government the authority to dictate religious practices, which I believe is inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nFurthermore, such an action could be perceived as favoring certain religious beliefs over others, creating division and potentially undermining the very fabric of religious tolerance that our nation was founded upon. \n\nI believe the decision regarding [mention the specific issue] should remain within the purview of individual religious institutions, allowing for diverse interpretations and practices without government interference.",
            "The conflict in Iraq presents a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency, with attempts to link it to the September 11th attacks, despite their tenuous connection. This manipulation of public sentiment, fueled by the nation's grief and anger, ultimately led to the commencement of hostilities in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I hold a strong anti-war stance, particularly regarding preemptive strikes. The Iraqi conflict echoes historical precedents like the Vietnam War, highlighting the government's failure to learn from past mistakes. The immense loss of American lives, coupled with the unforeseen consequences of regime change, underscores the gravity of this situation.\n\nThe removal of the Iraqi government without a comprehensive plan for the ensuing power vacuum resulted in chaos and instability. The attempt to establish a democratic system in Iraq, reminiscent of the endeavors in Vietnam, proved to be a protracted and arduous process.   \n\nThe complexities of nation-building, as exemplified by our own nation's historical struggles, demonstrate that establishing a stable and prosperous democracy is a lengthy and challenging undertaking.  \n\nThe administration's portrayal of a swift and successful intervention proved to be overly optimistic. The prolonged conflict, with its ongoing American casualties and the continued training of Iraqi security forces, raises crucial questions about the feasibility and ethical implications of our involvement.\n\nThe imperative to fulfill our commitments to the Iraqi people while weighing the escalating human and financial costs presents a formidable dilemma. The lack of clarity regarding the original objectives and the ongoing presence of oil interests further complicate the situation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the stated reasons for intervention and the reality on the ground, particularly the absence of weapons of mass destruction as initially claimed, casts doubt on the government's transparency and decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, the path forward remains uncertain. My hope is for a swift and peaceful resolution that brings stability and prosperity to Iraq while minimizing further loss of life.",
            "I firmly support marriage equality. This has been a deeply held belief for me. I see it as a matter of personal choice, something increasingly understood to have biological roots rather than solely sociological influences. \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control feels profoundly wrong. It's inhumane to restrict someone's fundamental freedoms due to their sexual orientation. I've always advocated for equal rights for all, including the right to marry.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage should be a private matter, a decision made between individuals and their families. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live fulfilling lives, raising families and contributing to their community, even though they lack legal recognition.\n\nThe notion that any individual or institution, especially the government, should define or control who can marry is troubling. It's a matter of personal autonomy and should remain a private affair. \n\nScientific research increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis, potentially influenced by factors like genetics and brain chemistry. This further underscores the importance of respecting individual choices and recognizing that sexual orientation is not a choice.\n\nThe contrast between the ease with which heterosexual couples can marry and the societal scrutiny faced by same-sex couples highlights the inherent inequality. Marriage should be a universally accessible right, free from public interference and legal barriers. It should be a celebration of love and commitment, not a subject for political debate or societal judgment.",
            "The nature of the internet necessitates an understanding of its public accessibility.  Once information is shared online, it becomes broadly visible, potentially influencing others' perceptions. This reality carries significant implications, especially when discussing sensitive topics. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. Sharing potentially concerning content, such as threats or violent language, can lead to serious repercussions. While it's important to remember that not all online expressions are intended maliciously, the potential for misinterpretation exists.  \n\nSchool officials, tasked with ensuring student safety, must act upon credible threats, even if they originate from online platforms.  A recent incident at my school illustrates this point. A seemingly innocuous online post, when viewed in the context of other information, raised concerns about a student's intentions.  \n\nThe key takeaway is that online content, shared in public forums, carries a degree of permanence and visibility.  Individuals must be mindful of the potential impact of their online presence, understanding that what they share can be accessed and interpreted by a wide audience.  \n\nWhile I believe there are ethical boundaries regarding school officials' access to student online activity,  the safety and well-being of the student body must ultimately take precedence.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial aim of restoring democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. It feels as though we're now engaged in the conflict solely to project an image of global dominance.  \n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's inception.  The personal history between former President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein casts a shadow of doubt on the purely altruistic nature of the conflict. If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a nation in need, that would be a justifiable cause. However, the presence of any personal agendas would undermine the legitimacy of the war.\n\nDespite achieving a decisive initial impact with the war's commencement, the prolonged conflict, spanning several years, has become excessive.  \n\nThe notion of promoting democracy through military intervention initially seemed reasonable, but I fear that our objectives have become muddled and misplaced. It appears we are now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than focusing on the original goals. \n\nThis extended conflict has exacted a heavy toll on our economy. Billions of dollars are being poured into a war that seems to have lost its purpose, money that could be better allocated to addressing pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and public services. \n\nThe fact that we are sacrificing the lives of our citizens in a foreign land for a cause that has become increasingly unclear is deeply troubling. It's time to recognize that the war has run its course and to focus our resources on the needs of our own nation.",
            "The concept of privacy online is a complex one. While sharing information on platforms like Myspace might seem like making it public, there are nuances to consider. A user chooses who they allow to view their profile, essentially granting permission to those they deem \"friends.\" However, the vast reach of the internet means that even seemingly private information can be accessed by unintended parties. \n\nThe ethical implications of monitoring student profiles raise concerns about potential discrimination and the invasion of privacy. While the desire to ensure student safety is understandable, assigning someone the task of scrutinizing every profile seems impractical and potentially harmful. It's crucial to balance safety concerns with individual freedoms.\n\nPersonally, I've experienced the unsettling feeling of encountering strangers who seem to know an excessive amount about me through platforms like Facebook.  Stories of individuals exploiting online information for malicious purposes highlight the potential dangers. It's a constant struggle to maintain a balance between online connectivity and personal security.\n\nThe incident involving a high school banning Myspace usage is particularly thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions can regulate students' online activities. While the school might have had safety concerns, it's debatable whether outright bans are an effective or ethical solution. Ultimately, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online behavior are crucial for navigating the complexities of online privacy.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift towards the current realities and potential future outcomes. \n\nGlobal sentiment, as evidenced by numerous polls, overwhelmingly condemns the war.  A significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and even U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this view.  The war has demonstrably destabilized the region, and the prospect of withdrawal, while challenging, may be the least detrimental option. \n\nThe cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East create significant obstacles to achieving lasting peace and stability.  Democratization efforts, while well-intentioned, may be ill-suited to the region's unique context.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been meticulously weighed against the potential consequences, which have proven to be catastrophic. The current situation resembles quicksand, making any foreseeable resolution fraught with difficulty.\n\nA gradual withdrawal, spanning a year or slightly longer, might be more manageable than an immediate departure. However, the Iraqi people's desire for our withdrawal, as expressed in polls, should be seriously considered.  \n\nUltimately, the question remains: what path offers the best chance for a positive outcome, both for Iraq and for the United States? Perhaps the most ethical approach is to respect the Iraqi people's wishes and allow them to chart their own future, even if it means accepting the inherent risks involved.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, extending beyond the experiences of women. While strides have been made towards equality, certain industries and societal expectations continue to present challenges. \n\nFor instance, women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering obstacles in advancing to leadership positions despite possessing the necessary qualifications. This bias stems from historical perceptions of women's roles in the business world. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents may face societal disapproval, as traditional gender roles often associate financial provision with masculinity.\n\nMoreover, the fashion industry presents a unique dynamic where men's expertise may be questioned based on stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nUltimately, societal norms and ingrained biases contribute to these forms of discrimination. While progress has been made, dismantling these deeply rooted attitudes requires a continuous effort to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that discrimination can manifest in various forms, extending beyond gender to encompass factors such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with various perspectives. While some argue that decriminalization, which reduces it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, is a step in the right direction, others believe it doesn't address the underlying concerns. \n\nOne key argument for decriminalization is the financial burden associated with arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. This process can be costly for municipalities, especially those facing financial challenges. \n\nProponents of decriminalization also point out that it can free up resources for other essential services, such as public education, social programs, and support for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some remain opposed to decriminalization due to concerns about its potential impact on public health and safety. They worry that increased accessibility could lead to more widespread use, including driving under the influence, and contribute to societal norms that normalize marijuana use.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to decriminalize marijuana involves weighing various factors, including public health, safety, financial considerations, and ethical concerns. It's a multifaceted debate that requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of the potential consequences.",
            "I would agree that the Catholic Church has a strong foundation in tradition. The enduring nature of their practices speaks to their commitment to their beliefs. However, I also believe that any institution, especially one as influential as the Church, must be open to adapting to the changing world. \n\nThere are aspects of Catholic doctrine that I find problematic. The emphasis on strict adherence to rules and the judgment of those who do not perfectly conform can feel exclusionary. This is particularly evident in their stance on interfaith marriage, as exemplified by my parents' experience. My father was Episcopalian, and my mother, a devout Catholic, was denied a Church wedding. This lack of acceptance of other faiths seems to contradict the core teaching of love and compassion that is central to Catholicism.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the Church's resistance to change, particularly regarding issues like allowing priests to marry, is outdated and hinders their ability to connect with a modern audience. While I understand the concerns about potential abuses, I believe that personal choices and human nature are complex and cannot be solely attributed to marital status.  \n\nUltimately, I feel a disconnect between the ideals espoused by the Church and the practices that often contradict them.",
            "The issue of marriage equality presents a complex dilemma. Balancing the principles of separation of church and state with the social and legal recognition of different relationship structures is a delicate task.  \n\nDefining marriage, particularly in the context of same-sex unions, raises profound questions.  Should the government, which traditionally doesn't intervene in religious matters like baptism,  become involved in defining and regulating a civil union that has religious significance for some?  \n\nIt seems logical to view marriage as primarily a civil contract, recognizing the commitment between two individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't grant special tax benefits or legal status based on religious affiliation, it shouldn't differentiate between marital unions based on the religious ceremony.\n\nIf states can reach a consensus on a fair and equitable approach to marriage equality, then federal legislation should reflect those shared values.  However, amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems an extreme and unnecessary measure. While this issue is deeply important to many, it doesn't warrant such a drastic constitutional change.  The Constitution should be preserved for matters of fundamental rights and liberties, not for regulating social norms.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my perspective on homosexuality is complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully align with that lifestyle. However, I believe in the fundamental right for individuals to choose their own paths and advocate for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nI think this issue is best handled at the state level rather than imposed nationally.  The United States is diverse, with varying political leanings and societal values. Democratic-leaning states are likely to be more progressive on issues like same-sex marriage, while Republican-leaning states may hold different views. \n\nIndividuals choose where they reside, and I believe they should respect the laws and social norms of the state they call home. If a state legalizes gay marriage, those living there should accept that as the prevailing stance within their community.\n\nUltimately, I support equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nThe federal government should not dictate social policies that are best decided at the state level.  A president, even one with strong personal beliefs, shouldn't impose a national stance on such a sensitive and multifaceted issue.  The ideal solution is to allow each state to determine its own approach, fostering a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse viewpoints can be accommodated.",
            "School officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students.  While the concept of privacy is important,  it's crucial to weigh that against the potential for harm.  Social media platforms like MySpace, being publicly accessible, inherently carry the risk of content being viewed by anyone, including school officials.  \n\nIf school officials become aware of something on a student's profile that raises concerns about their safety or the safety of others, it's understandable why they would investigate.  Preventing tragedies like Columbine should be a top priority, and if accessing a student's public profile helps achieve that goal, it's a justifiable action.  \n\nIt's important to remember that actions online have consequences, just like actions in the real world.  Students should be mindful of what they share publicly, as it can have unintended repercussions.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I strongly supported military action in response to the attacks, fueled by a desire for retribution. Looking back, however, I believe the emotional climate at the time overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences.\n\nOur involvement in the conflict feels like a hasty decision, lacking a comprehensive plan and adequate preparation. I've come to believe that our presence has not achieved the desired results and may even have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe internal conflicts within the region seem to be a significant obstacle to stability. It's difficult to assess how our involvement truly contributes to progress when factions are deeply divided amongst themselves. \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now question whether military intervention was the most effective approach.\n\nThe realities of conflict in that region differ drastically from our own experiences.  What we perceive as progress may not align with the aspirations of the local population.  Perhaps a more diplomatic and collaborative strategy would have been more fruitful."
