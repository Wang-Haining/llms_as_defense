            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing challenges in maintaining its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues plays a role in this.  \n\nThe Church's traditionally conservative views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception may not resonate with a growing segment of society that holds more progressive beliefs. While the Church is entitled to its positions, these views can appear outdated to some, potentially leading to a disconnect with younger generations and those who find themselves at odds with these doctrines.\n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective on these matters, it might be better positioned to connect with a wider audience and prevent further decline in its following.  \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable or marginalized within a religious institution that opposes these values.\n\nThe Church's stance on such issues can create a sense of exclusion for those who hold differing views, potentially driving them away from the faith.\n\nIt's worth considering if allowing married priests or ordaining women could address some of these concerns and foster a more inclusive environment.  \n\nWhile these measures might not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more relatable and welcoming atmosphere for a broader range of individuals.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unfair to hold people accountable for something inherent to their identity. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhile I've given this topic some thought, it's important to recognize that personal experiences shape our perspectives. I identify as straight, and while I can't fully grasp the complexities of being gay, I can empathize with the desire for equal rights and recognition. \n\nI also believe the federal government should not be involved in regulating personal matters like marriage. It's a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be to protect individual liberties rather than dictate personal choices.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears.  \n\nOne common concern is that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow undermine traditional family structures.  However, the nature of a loving, committed relationship transcends sexual orientation.  Just as a coin has two sides, both sides of the same fundamental value,  heterosexual and homosexual relationships share core elements – commitment, love, and partnership.\n\nBeyond the emotional aspect, there are significant legal and social implications.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry has a profound impact on their access to essential rights and benefits.  For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and property ownership, legally recognized partners are afforded crucial protections that unmarried partners lack.  \n\nThe issue of religious objections is also frequently raised. While individuals are certainly entitled to their beliefs, government policies should not be based on specific religious doctrines.  Segregation based on sexual orientation is unjust and perpetuates inequality.  Marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not a religious sacrament.\n\nFurthermore, studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples.  Arguments suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are somehow disadvantaged are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe federal government has a responsibility to ensure equal rights and protections for all its citizens.  Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, demonstrating that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are valued and respected members of society.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer provided me with valuable insight into the complexities surrounding drug legality. I've observed firsthand that  a substance's legal status doesn't necessarily reflect its potential therapeutic benefits. \n\nWhile I believe making illicit drugs readily accessible to the public is unwise, I do advocate for their controlled use in medical settings.  Many medications, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse, yet they are essential tools for managing pain and other conditions.  Denying potential therapeutic benefits solely based on societal stigma, as is often the case with marijuana, seems counterproductive.  \n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is difficult, as both substances have the potential for abuse. However, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, responsible marijuana use, when properly regulated, may offer therapeutic advantages.  \n\nI envision a gradual approach to marijuana legalization, starting with controlled medical use. This phased implementation would allow for careful monitoring and regulation, mitigating potential risks while allowing patients to access potential benefits. Removing the societal stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to fostering responsible use and encouraging open discussions about its potential applications.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However,  it's essential to recognize that it's not inherently as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting the narrative and promoting responsible use, we can unlock the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana while minimizing potential risks.",
            "The Church has definitely evolved to fit into the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest outfits – cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses.  \n\nIt was quite a routine, especially since I went to a private school where many of my friends also attended church. We'd often see each other there on weekends.  But things have changed. Now, they have a special mass geared towards teenagers, shortened to thirty minutes. People dress much more casually, especially during the summer. I've seen people arrive straight from the beach!  Families rush in late, and even the morning masses, which I used to dress up for, now see people in jeans and khakis.  \n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other aspects of the Church, I primarily observe these changes.  I don't have a deep understanding of the Church's internal politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't believe these issues could have been prevented simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and the attraction towards young children is a complex issue.\n\nI think becoming a priest is a personal choice, and some religions allow married clergy, like the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both faith and marriage, perhaps they could explore other denominations.\n\nMy perspective is that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. People aren't simply \"born\" that way, and it's not solely a result of upbringing.  While circumstances might play a role, genetics seem to be a significant factor, and marriage wouldn't necessarily eliminate that predisposition.\n\nIf the Church was aware of these issues and attempted to cover them up, that would be deeply wrong. However, I don't believe they were always aware of every instance.",
            "The initial concept held some appeal, but the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow.  It seemed as though the Iraq War was, in part, a response to those events. The Bush administration initially linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction - claims that have since been proven false. This deeply troubled me, and frankly, the Iraq War fills me with anger.\n\nThe Bush administration's handling of the situation deeply concerns me. I believe they misled the American people and have yet to acknowledge their actions. Even Colin Powell, who gave that prominent presentation at the UN, has stated that he wasn't fully convinced by the evidence even while delivering it. To me, this constitutes a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense.  I feel the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to diminish its importance, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards war.\n\nThere have been allegations, made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, that the younger Bush had personal motivations for targeting Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration.  It's also been suggested that securing access to energy resources was a contributing factor, a rather manipulative approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe duration of the conflict is unacceptable.  While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further loss of life, the current path forward seems problematic as well.  The proposed solution involves a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, intervening to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could ultimately create further complications.\n\nThe interim government appears to be crumbling, and the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable.  The Prime Minister seems to have limited influence over the political process.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we were actively combating not long ago, now hold significant power within the Iraqi Parliament.  The political landscape is fraught with tension due to these competing factions vying for control.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I acknowledge the initial impetus for the conflict, which stemmed from the tragic events of 9/11, I find myself questioning the continued justification for our involvement.  \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict.  Furthermore, the stated goals of promoting democracy and securing oil resources appear to be at odds with the reality on the ground. The protracted nature of the war has resulted in significant civilian casualties and instability, casting a shadow over our commitment to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe process of nation-building is inherently challenging, and attempting to impose Western democratic ideals upon a culture with deeply rooted traditions may ultimately prove counterproductive. The potential for resentment and resistance to our intervention is a serious concern.  \n\nMoreover, the ongoing conflict has fueled extremist ideologies and exacerbated sectarian tensions, creating a breeding ground for further violence.  While I understand the desire to protect American interests and support our troops, I believe that a sustained military presence in Iraq is not a sustainable solution. \n\nA more measured approach, focused on diplomacy, economic development, and supporting local initiatives for peace and reconciliation, may offer a more promising path forward.",
            "The question of legality regarding this particular issue is one that deeply concerns me. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is paramount. It explicitly delineates the boundaries between religious institutions and governmental authority, and I feel any attempt to encroach upon those boundaries would be a direct violation of this foundational principle.\n\nThose advocating for its criminalization seem to be prioritizing the beliefs of a specific religious group over others. While it's true that certain denominations, such as many Catholics and Christians, oppose it,  it's essential to recognize the diversity of viewpoints within these faiths.  Furthermore, it is not the government's role to dictate what religious organizations can or cannot deem permissible.\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom is a cornerstone of American society. It allows for a multiplicity of beliefs and practices to flourish. Introducing an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very principle, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on individual liberties. \n\nI firmly believe that the government should remain neutral on this matter.  The decision regarding its legality should rest with the respective religious communities, not with elected officials whose personal beliefs may not reflect the diverse perspectives within their constituencies. \n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment is unclear. It's difficult to predict whether it would have a positive or negative effect on society or the economy.  However, it's crucial to prioritize the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and avoid actions that could undermine religious freedom.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  From the outset, there were questions about the government's justification for the invasion.  While the attacks of September 11th understandably sparked a desire for retribution, the connection between those events and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best.  The administration's rhetoric seemed to blur the lines, capitalizing on the public's fear and anger to garner support for military action.\n\nPersonally, I'm deeply opposed to war, particularly preemptive strikes.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War.  A significant number of American soldiers have perished, a tragic consequence of a conflict that seemed to lack clear objectives and a well-defined exit strategy.  The US government's failure to anticipate the post-invasion chaos and the rise of insurgency highlights a lack of foresight and planning.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic government in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved to be a monumental challenge.  This parallels the difficulties faced during the Vietnam War, where the US attempted to impose its political system on a deeply divided nation. Both conflicts demonstrate the complexities of nation-building and the unintended consequences of intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq has dragged on for years, with significant costs in terms of both American lives and resources.  The training of Iraqi security forces remains a work in progress, and the future of the country remains uncertain. The initial claims about weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded, further fueling skepticism about the government's motives.\n\nThe question of whether the US should continue its involvement in Iraq remains a deeply contentious one.  While some argue for a complete withdrawal, others believe it is crucial to see the conflict through to its conclusion.  Ultimately, the decision involves weighing the human cost against the potential benefits of a stable and democratic Iraq.  It is a decision that demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and growing evidence suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis rather than being solely a sociological construct.  \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control seems fundamentally unjust.  I believe government should not interfere in these personal matters. Marriage is a private affair, a decision made between two people, not a matter for public or governmental intervention.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and raise families, just like any other couple. They contribute to our community and deserve the same recognition and legal protections as everyone else.  \n\nThe idea that political figures should dictate who can and cannot marry based on their interpretation of religious texts feels both antiquated and intrusive.  \n\nScientific research increasingly points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, suggesting it's not a choice but an inherent aspect of a person's identity.  This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current situation highlights a double standard. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without public scrutiny, while same-sex couples face intense media attention and societal judgment simply for seeking the same right. Marriage should be a private and personal matter, not a public spectacle.",
            "The nature of online platforms necessitates a careful consideration of the content we share. Once something is posted on the internet, it enters a public domain accessible to a vast audience. This accessibility carries significant implications, as online content can shape perceptions and influence opinions. \n\nAs someone who has worked in a residential advisor role, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online postings.  Expressing thoughts about harmful actions, even in jest, can be misconstrued and lead to serious repercussions. Schools, for example,  have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and may act upon information gleaned from online platforms if it raises concerns.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential for misuse of online information, it's equally crucial to recognize the importance of responsible disclosure.\n\nIndividuals should be mindful of the permanence of online content and consider the potential impact it may have on their reputation and relationships. Schools, while obligated to address potential threats, should navigate this delicate balance with sensitivity and respect for student privacy.",
            "The prolonged nature of the conflict deeply concerns me. While the initial aims, restoring democracy in a nation lacking fair governance, seemed noble, I believe we have strayed from that original purpose. The conflict now feels driven by an urge to assert global dominance, a pursuit of power rather than principle.\n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's initiation.  The historical tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein raise doubts about the purity of the original intentions.  If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a country lacking a just political system, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, it undermines the moral basis of the war.\n\nThe initial stages, the decisive military action, conveyed a powerful message. Yet, the conflict's continued escalation, stretching for years, seems excessive.  \n\nIf our goal was to liberate a nation under a tyrannical regime, then it was a worthy endeavor. However, I fear our rationale has become muddled and distorted over time. We appear to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than a just resolution.\n\nThe conflict has undoubtedly lingered long enough. It's time for the nation to take responsibility for its own future. We've been draining our economy, spending billions while neglecting domestic issues like poverty and inadequate infrastructure. These are pressing concerns that deserve our financial attention.\n\nBillions are being funneled into a prolonged war, diverting resources from crucial domestic needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.  These are areas that require immediate attention and investment.\n\nSpending taxpayer money on a conflict that has lost its original purpose is morally and financially irresponsible. It's time to end this war and redirect our resources towards addressing the critical challenges facing our own nation.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one. While it's true that information shared publicly on platforms like Myspace is accessible to anyone, the question arises about the boundaries of acceptable access.  \n\nFor instance, while a user might choose to make their profile visible to friends, it's unsettling to consider the potential for individuals to exploit this openness for malicious purposes. The scenario you described, where someone's online activity prevented a potentially dangerous situation, raises ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhile it's impractical to monitor every student's profile constantly, the possibility of targeted monitoring in specific circumstances, such as when there are credible threats, presents a difficult balance between security and individual privacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it disconcerting that personal information can be so readily accessible online.  I've encountered situations where strangers have contacted me through platforms like Facebook, possessing details about me that they shouldn't have.  \n\nThis highlights the vulnerability of online spaces and the need for caution. While these platforms offer valuable opportunities for communication and connection, it's crucial to be mindful of the information we share and the potential consequences.\n\nThe situation you mentioned regarding high schools banning Myspace is also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions have the authority to regulate students' online activities outside of school grounds.  This issue touches upon the evolving nature of privacy in the digital age and the challenges of navigating these complex boundaries.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift to the current realities and potential solutions.  \n\nA significant global consensus, reflected in polls conducted both within the United States, Iraq, and internationally, indicates a strong belief that the war was a misguided endeavor. This sentiment is shared by a majority of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who advocate for a swift withdrawal.  \n\nThe war's consequences have been undeniably devastating, both before and after our involvement. The intricate cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East pose significant challenges to effective engagement.  Imposing democratic ideals on a region with its own distinct cultural and historical context has proven to be a problematic approach.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential repercussions. The current situation necessitates a strategic and measured withdrawal. \n\nDespite the administration's potential arguments for continued presence, I believe a phased withdrawal over the course of a year or slightly longer would be a more responsible course of action.  \n\nUltimately, the Iraqi people themselves have a crucial stake in their future. If we were to consult them directly and they expressed a desire for our departure, it would be both ethically responsible and acknowledge their right to self-determination. While this may present challenges, it would ultimately be a more transparent and potentially more constructive approach.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it manifests in ways that extend beyond traditional gender roles. While women continue to face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to societal biases and the \"glass ceiling,\" men also encounter discrimination in certain fields. \n\nFor example, stay-at-home fathers often face societal pressure and judgment for not adhering to traditional masculine roles, despite their desire to prioritize family life. Similarly, men in the fashion industry sometimes struggle to be taken seriously due to prevailing stereotypes about masculinity and creative expression.\n\nThese examples illustrate that gender discrimination is not a monolithic issue but rather a complex web of societal perceptions and expectations that can disadvantage individuals based on their gender and chosen path. \n\nProgress has been made in challenging these biases, with women increasingly entering leadership positions and stay-at-home fathers gaining greater acceptance. However, change is gradual, and continued efforts are needed to dismantle deeply ingrained societal norms and promote equality for all.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex. While some advocate for full legalization, others, particularly in financially struggling communities, oppose it due to the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration. Decriminalization, on the other hand, shifts the focus from criminal penalties to civil citations, similar to traffic violations. \n\nThis approach reduces the severity of consequences while still acknowledging the potential for misuse.  Supporters of decriminalization argue that it frees up resources for municipalities to invest in vital public services like education, social programs, and homelessness assistance. They also contend that it addresses the societal stigma surrounding marijuana use, allowing for a more open and honest discussion about its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, opponents express concerns about the normalization of marijuana use and potential for increased accessibility, leading to public health and safety issues. They worry about the influence on youth, the potential for impaired driving, and the normalization of drug use in general.\n\nThe economic impact of marijuana legalization or decriminalization is a significant factor in the debate. Proponents highlight the potential for tax revenue and job creation, while opponents emphasize the costs associated with potential increases in healthcare expenses, addiction treatment, and social services.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana involves a careful consideration of various societal, economic, and ethical factors.",
            "While I recognize the value of tradition and the historical significance of the Catholic Church's practices, I believe there are aspects of their doctrine that need to be re-evaluated in light of modern values. \n\nOne area of concern is the rigidity surrounding religious observance. While I understand the importance of faith, I feel that a more inclusive approach to religious practice would be beneficial. For instance, the expectation that every Catholic attend mass weekly and adhere strictly to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion towards those who don't perfectly conform. \n\nThis lack of acceptance extends to individuals of other faiths.  My own parents experienced this firsthand when they were denied a Catholic marriage due to my father's Episcopalian background. This incident highlights a hypocrisy in the Church's teachings, as loving others is a core principle yet, in practice, acceptance of those outside the Catholic faith is limited.\n\nThe discrepancy between doctrine and practice is also evident in the ongoing debate surrounding priestly celibacy. While the Church maintains this requirement, many argue that allowing priests to marry could potentially address concerns about abuse of power.  \n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the issue of abuse is complex and multifaceted. While some might argue that permitting marriage could potentially mitigate certain risks, it is unlikely to be a complete solution.  The root causes of such abuse lie in deeper societal issues and individual pathology, and addressing them requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma for me.  I'm still grappling with the multifaceted implications, finding it difficult to definitively say whether one side is more right than the other.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage itself.  Drawing clear boundaries without causing offense to any group is a formidable task. \n\nMy personal inclination leans towards viewing marriage as a civil union, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious sacraments like baptism, it shouldn't dictate the specific form a marriage takes.  Civil unions, in my view, adequately recognize the commitment between two individuals.\n\nThe government should refrain from  scrutinizing the nature of a union, focusing instead on the fundamental fact that two people have chosen to join together.  If all states can reach a consensus on this matter, I believe they should advocate for federal legislation recognizing civil unions nationwide.\n\nHowever, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment aiming to ban same-sex marriage.  Altering the constitution for this purpose seems disproportionate to the issue. While it holds significant importance for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic measure.  The constitution should be amended only for matters of truly paramount national concern.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has given me a complex perspective on homosexuality. While I value the relationships of my many gay friends, I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to decide its own stance on marriage equality.  Given the diverse political landscapes across the nation, it's natural that states with differing viewpoints will approach this topic in distinct ways.  A state with a predominantly Democratic population might naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and residents of that state should respect the decisions made by their elected representatives.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to live according to their beliefs and values within the framework of their chosen community.  Therefore, I support the right of each state to determine its own marriage laws. I also believe that such a system avoids imposing a single viewpoint on the entire country, allowing for a more nuanced and localized approach to this complex issue.",
            "The concept of privacy online is complex, especially when it comes to student safety. While it's true that platforms like Myspace are intended for public sharing, the potential consequences of posts can be significant. School officials, in their role to ensure a safe learning environment, often have to navigate this delicate balance.\n\nIf information found online indicates a potential threat to student well-being, it's understandable why officials would want to investigate. This isn't about snooping; it's about taking proactive measures to prevent tragedies.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet leaves a permanent digital footprint. What seems like a harmless post today could have repercussions down the line. It's wise to exercise caution and consider the potential impact of our online actions.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with both individuals and institutions to create a safe and secure online space.  Schools must protect their students, and students must understand the implications of their online presence.",
            "The aftermath of September 11th had a profound impact on my views regarding the war. Initially, driven by a deeply personal connection to the tragedy, I strongly supported military intervention. I believed that a forceful response was necessary to punish those responsible and prevent further attacks. However, as time passed, I began to question the wisdom of our actions.\n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding the event, I realized, might have clouded our judgment. We seemed to act impulsively, lacking a comprehensive strategy or understanding of the long-term consequences. The lack of preparation was evident, and the conflict ultimately backfired, failing to achieve its intended objectives.\n\nMy perspective shifted significantly. Observing the ongoing conflict, I was struck by the internal divisions within the region. It became clear that external intervention might be counterproductive if the primary focus should be on fostering unity and stability within the country itself.\n\nThe complexities of war, particularly in that specific context, became more apparent. The cultural and societal differences led to misunderstandings and unintended consequences.  The motivations and goals of all parties involved were deeply intertwined, and the situation was far more nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nReflecting on the war's impact, I see it as a complex and multifaceted failure. While the initial intention might have been noble, the execution was flawed. The lack of a clear plan, the emotional underpinnings, and the cultural misunderstandings all contributed to a situation that continues to be fraught with challenges."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing challenges in maintaining its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues plays a role in this.  \n\nThe Church's traditionally conservative views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception may not resonate with a growing segment of society that holds more progressive beliefs. While the Church is entitled to its positions, these views can appear outdated to some, potentially leading to a disconnect with younger generations and those who find themselves at odds with these doctrines.\n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective on these matters, it might be better positioned to connect with a wider audience and prevent further decline in its following.  \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable or marginalized within a religious institution that opposes these values.\n\nThe Church's stance on such issues can create a sense of exclusion for those who hold differing views, potentially driving them away from the faith.\n\nIt's worth considering if allowing married priests or ordaining women could address some of these concerns and foster a more inclusive environment.  \n\nWhile these measures might not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more relatable and welcoming atmosphere for a broader range of individuals.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unfair to hold people accountable for something inherent to their identity. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhile I've given this topic some thought, it's important to recognize that personal experiences shape our perspectives. I identify as straight, and while I can't fully grasp the complexities of being gay, I can empathize with the desire for equal rights and recognition. \n\nI also believe the federal government should not be involved in regulating personal matters like marriage. It's a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be to protect individual liberties rather than dictate personal choices.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears.  \n\nOne common concern is that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow undermine traditional family structures.  However, the nature of a loving, committed relationship transcends sexual orientation.  Just as a coin has two sides, both sides of the same fundamental value,  heterosexual and homosexual relationships share core elements – commitment, love, and partnership.\n\nBeyond the emotional aspect, there are significant legal and social implications.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry has a profound impact on their access to essential rights and benefits.  For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and property ownership, legally recognized partners are afforded crucial protections that unmarried partners lack.  \n\nThe issue of religious objections is also frequently raised. While individuals are certainly entitled to their beliefs, government policies should not be based on specific religious doctrines.  Segregation based on sexual orientation is unjust and perpetuates inequality.  Marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not a religious sacrament.\n\nFurthermore, studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples.  Arguments suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are somehow disadvantaged are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe federal government has a responsibility to ensure equal rights and protections for all its citizens.  Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, demonstrating that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are valued and respected members of society.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer provided me with valuable insight into the complexities surrounding drug legality. I've observed firsthand that  a substance's legal status doesn't necessarily reflect its potential therapeutic benefits. \n\nWhile I believe making illicit drugs readily accessible to the public is unwise, I do advocate for their controlled use in medical settings.  Many medications, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse, yet they are essential tools for managing pain and other conditions.  Denying potential therapeutic benefits solely based on societal stigma, as is often the case with marijuana, seems counterproductive.  \n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is difficult, as both substances have the potential for abuse. However, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, responsible marijuana use, when properly regulated, may offer therapeutic advantages.  \n\nI envision a gradual approach to marijuana legalization, starting with controlled medical use. This phased implementation would allow for careful monitoring and regulation, mitigating potential risks while allowing patients to access potential benefits. Removing the societal stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to fostering responsible use and encouraging open discussions about its potential applications.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However,  it's essential to recognize that it's not inherently as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting the narrative and promoting responsible use, we can unlock the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana while minimizing potential risks.",
            "The Church has definitely evolved to fit into the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest outfits – cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses.  \n\nIt was quite a routine, especially since I went to a private school where many of my friends also attended church. We'd often see each other there on weekends.  But things have changed. Now, they have a special mass geared towards teenagers, shortened to thirty minutes. People dress much more casually, especially during the summer. I've seen people arrive straight from the beach!  Families rush in late, and even the morning masses, which I used to dress up for, now see people in jeans and khakis.  \n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other aspects of the Church, I primarily observe these changes.  I don't have a deep understanding of the Church's internal politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't believe these issues could have been prevented simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and the attraction towards young children is a complex issue.\n\nI think becoming a priest is a personal choice, and some religions allow married clergy, like the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both faith and marriage, perhaps they could explore other denominations.\n\nMy perspective is that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. People aren't simply \"born\" that way, and it's not solely a result of upbringing.  While circumstances might play a role, genetics seem to be a significant factor, and marriage wouldn't necessarily eliminate that predisposition.\n\nIf the Church was aware of these issues and attempted to cover them up, that would be deeply wrong. However, I don't believe they were always aware of every instance.",
            "The initial concept held some appeal, but the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow.  It seemed as though the Iraq War was, in part, a response to those events. The Bush administration initially linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction - claims that have since been proven false. This deeply troubled me, and frankly, the Iraq War fills me with anger.\n\nThe Bush administration's handling of the situation deeply concerns me. I believe they misled the American people and have yet to acknowledge their actions. Even Colin Powell, who gave that prominent presentation at the UN, has stated that he wasn't fully convinced by the evidence even while delivering it. To me, this constitutes a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense.  I feel the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to diminish its importance, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards war.\n\nThere have been allegations, made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, that the younger Bush had personal motivations for targeting Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration.  It's also been suggested that securing access to energy resources was a contributing factor, a rather manipulative approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe duration of the conflict is unacceptable.  While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further loss of life, the current path forward seems problematic as well.  The proposed solution involves a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, intervening to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could ultimately create further complications.\n\nThe interim government appears to be crumbling, and the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable.  The Prime Minister seems to have limited influence over the political process.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we were actively combating not long ago, now hold significant power within the Iraqi Parliament.  The political landscape is fraught with tension due to these competing factions vying for control.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I acknowledge the initial impetus for the conflict, which stemmed from the tragic events of 9/11, I find myself questioning the continued justification for our involvement.  \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict.  Furthermore, the stated goals of promoting democracy and securing oil resources appear to be at odds with the reality on the ground. The protracted nature of the war has resulted in significant civilian casualties and instability, casting a shadow over our commitment to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe process of nation-building is inherently challenging, and attempting to impose Western democratic ideals upon a culture with deeply rooted traditions may ultimately prove counterproductive. The potential for resentment and resistance to our intervention is a serious concern.  \n\nMoreover, the ongoing conflict has fueled extremist ideologies and exacerbated sectarian tensions, creating a breeding ground for further violence.  While I understand the desire to protect American interests and support our troops, I believe that a sustained military presence in Iraq is not a sustainable solution. \n\nA more measured approach, focused on diplomacy, economic development, and supporting local initiatives for peace and reconciliation, may offer a more promising path forward.",
            "The question of legality regarding this particular issue is one that deeply concerns me. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is paramount. It explicitly delineates the boundaries between religious institutions and governmental authority, and I feel any attempt to encroach upon those boundaries would be a direct violation of this foundational principle.\n\nThose advocating for its criminalization seem to be prioritizing the beliefs of a specific religious group over others. While it's true that certain denominations, such as many Catholics and Christians, oppose it,  it's essential to recognize the diversity of viewpoints within these faiths.  Furthermore, it is not the government's role to dictate what religious organizations can or cannot deem permissible.\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom is a cornerstone of American society. It allows for a multiplicity of beliefs and practices to flourish. Introducing an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very principle, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on individual liberties. \n\nI firmly believe that the government should remain neutral on this matter.  The decision regarding its legality should rest with the respective religious communities, not with elected officials whose personal beliefs may not reflect the diverse perspectives within their constituencies. \n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment is unclear. It's difficult to predict whether it would have a positive or negative effect on society or the economy.  However, it's crucial to prioritize the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and avoid actions that could undermine religious freedom.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  From the outset, there were questions about the government's justification for the invasion.  While the attacks of September 11th understandably sparked a desire for retribution, the connection between those events and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best.  The administration's rhetoric seemed to blur the lines, capitalizing on the public's fear and anger to garner support for military action.\n\nPersonally, I'm deeply opposed to war, particularly preemptive strikes.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War.  A significant number of American soldiers have perished, a tragic consequence of a conflict that seemed to lack clear objectives and a well-defined exit strategy.  The US government's failure to anticipate the post-invasion chaos and the rise of insurgency highlights a lack of foresight and planning.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic government in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved to be a monumental challenge.  This parallels the difficulties faced during the Vietnam War, where the US attempted to impose its political system on a deeply divided nation. Both conflicts demonstrate the complexities of nation-building and the unintended consequences of intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq has dragged on for years, with significant costs in terms of both American lives and resources.  The training of Iraqi security forces remains a work in progress, and the future of the country remains uncertain. The initial claims about weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded, further fueling skepticism about the government's motives.\n\nThe question of whether the US should continue its involvement in Iraq remains a deeply contentious one.  While some argue for a complete withdrawal, others believe it is crucial to see the conflict through to its conclusion.  Ultimately, the decision involves weighing the human cost against the potential benefits of a stable and democratic Iraq.  It is a decision that demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and growing evidence suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis rather than being solely a sociological construct.  \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control seems fundamentally unjust.  I believe government should not interfere in these personal matters. Marriage is a private affair, a decision made between two people, not a matter for public or governmental intervention.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and raise families, just like any other couple. They contribute to our community and deserve the same recognition and legal protections as everyone else.  \n\nThe idea that political figures should dictate who can and cannot marry based on their interpretation of religious texts feels both antiquated and intrusive.  \n\nScientific research increasingly points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, suggesting it's not a choice but an inherent aspect of a person's identity.  This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current situation highlights a double standard. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without public scrutiny, while same-sex couples face intense media attention and societal judgment simply for seeking the same right. Marriage should be a private and personal matter, not a public spectacle.",
            "The nature of online platforms necessitates a careful consideration of the content we share. Once something is posted on the internet, it enters a public domain accessible to a vast audience. This accessibility carries significant implications, as online content can shape perceptions and influence opinions. \n\nAs someone who has worked in a residential advisor role, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online postings.  Expressing thoughts about harmful actions, even in jest, can be misconstrued and lead to serious repercussions. Schools, for example,  have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and may act upon information gleaned from online platforms if it raises concerns.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential for misuse of online information, it's equally crucial to recognize the importance of responsible disclosure.\n\nIndividuals should be mindful of the permanence of online content and consider the potential impact it may have on their reputation and relationships. Schools, while obligated to address potential threats, should navigate this delicate balance with sensitivity and respect for student privacy.",
            "The prolonged nature of the conflict deeply concerns me. While the initial aims, restoring democracy in a nation lacking fair governance, seemed noble, I believe we have strayed from that original purpose. The conflict now feels driven by an urge to assert global dominance, a pursuit of power rather than principle.\n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's initiation.  The historical tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein raise doubts about the purity of the original intentions.  If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a country lacking a just political system, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, it undermines the moral basis of the war.\n\nThe initial stages, the decisive military action, conveyed a powerful message. Yet, the conflict's continued escalation, stretching for years, seems excessive.  \n\nIf our goal was to liberate a nation under a tyrannical regime, then it was a worthy endeavor. However, I fear our rationale has become muddled and distorted over time. We appear to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than a just resolution.\n\nThe conflict has undoubtedly lingered long enough. It's time for the nation to take responsibility for its own future. We've been draining our economy, spending billions while neglecting domestic issues like poverty and inadequate infrastructure. These are pressing concerns that deserve our financial attention.\n\nBillions are being funneled into a prolonged war, diverting resources from crucial domestic needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.  These are areas that require immediate attention and investment.\n\nSpending taxpayer money on a conflict that has lost its original purpose is morally and financially irresponsible. It's time to end this war and redirect our resources towards addressing the critical challenges facing our own nation.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one. While it's true that information shared publicly on platforms like Myspace is accessible to anyone, the question arises about the boundaries of acceptable access.  \n\nFor instance, while a user might choose to make their profile visible to friends, it's unsettling to consider the potential for individuals to exploit this openness for malicious purposes. The scenario you described, where someone's online activity prevented a potentially dangerous situation, raises ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhile it's impractical to monitor every student's profile constantly, the possibility of targeted monitoring in specific circumstances, such as when there are credible threats, presents a difficult balance between security and individual privacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it disconcerting that personal information can be so readily accessible online.  I've encountered situations where strangers have contacted me through platforms like Facebook, possessing details about me that they shouldn't have.  \n\nThis highlights the vulnerability of online spaces and the need for caution. While these platforms offer valuable opportunities for communication and connection, it's crucial to be mindful of the information we share and the potential consequences.\n\nThe situation you mentioned regarding high schools banning Myspace is also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions have the authority to regulate students' online activities outside of school grounds.  This issue touches upon the evolving nature of privacy in the digital age and the challenges of navigating these complex boundaries.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift to the current realities and potential solutions.  \n\nA significant global consensus, reflected in polls conducted both within the United States, Iraq, and internationally, indicates a strong belief that the war was a misguided endeavor. This sentiment is shared by a majority of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who advocate for a swift withdrawal.  \n\nThe war's consequences have been undeniably devastating, both before and after our involvement. The intricate cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East pose significant challenges to effective engagement.  Imposing democratic ideals on a region with its own distinct cultural and historical context has proven to be a problematic approach.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential repercussions. The current situation necessitates a strategic and measured withdrawal. \n\nDespite the administration's potential arguments for continued presence, I believe a phased withdrawal over the course of a year or slightly longer would be a more responsible course of action.  \n\nUltimately, the Iraqi people themselves have a crucial stake in their future. If we were to consult them directly and they expressed a desire for our departure, it would be both ethically responsible and acknowledge their right to self-determination. While this may present challenges, it would ultimately be a more transparent and potentially more constructive approach.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it manifests in ways that extend beyond traditional gender roles. While women continue to face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to societal biases and the \"glass ceiling,\" men also encounter discrimination in certain fields. \n\nFor example, stay-at-home fathers often face societal pressure and judgment for not adhering to traditional masculine roles, despite their desire to prioritize family life. Similarly, men in the fashion industry sometimes struggle to be taken seriously due to prevailing stereotypes about masculinity and creative expression.\n\nThese examples illustrate that gender discrimination is not a monolithic issue but rather a complex web of societal perceptions and expectations that can disadvantage individuals based on their gender and chosen path. \n\nProgress has been made in challenging these biases, with women increasingly entering leadership positions and stay-at-home fathers gaining greater acceptance. However, change is gradual, and continued efforts are needed to dismantle deeply ingrained societal norms and promote equality for all.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex. While some advocate for full legalization, others, particularly in financially struggling communities, oppose it due to the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration. Decriminalization, on the other hand, shifts the focus from criminal penalties to civil citations, similar to traffic violations. \n\nThis approach reduces the severity of consequences while still acknowledging the potential for misuse.  Supporters of decriminalization argue that it frees up resources for municipalities to invest in vital public services like education, social programs, and homelessness assistance. They also contend that it addresses the societal stigma surrounding marijuana use, allowing for a more open and honest discussion about its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, opponents express concerns about the normalization of marijuana use and potential for increased accessibility, leading to public health and safety issues. They worry about the influence on youth, the potential for impaired driving, and the normalization of drug use in general.\n\nThe economic impact of marijuana legalization or decriminalization is a significant factor in the debate. Proponents highlight the potential for tax revenue and job creation, while opponents emphasize the costs associated with potential increases in healthcare expenses, addiction treatment, and social services.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana involves a careful consideration of various societal, economic, and ethical factors.",
            "While I recognize the value of tradition and the historical significance of the Catholic Church's practices, I believe there are aspects of their doctrine that need to be re-evaluated in light of modern values. \n\nOne area of concern is the rigidity surrounding religious observance. While I understand the importance of faith, I feel that a more inclusive approach to religious practice would be beneficial. For instance, the expectation that every Catholic attend mass weekly and adhere strictly to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion towards those who don't perfectly conform. \n\nThis lack of acceptance extends to individuals of other faiths.  My own parents experienced this firsthand when they were denied a Catholic marriage due to my father's Episcopalian background. This incident highlights a hypocrisy in the Church's teachings, as loving others is a core principle yet, in practice, acceptance of those outside the Catholic faith is limited.\n\nThe discrepancy between doctrine and practice is also evident in the ongoing debate surrounding priestly celibacy. While the Church maintains this requirement, many argue that allowing priests to marry could potentially address concerns about abuse of power.  \n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the issue of abuse is complex and multifaceted. While some might argue that permitting marriage could potentially mitigate certain risks, it is unlikely to be a complete solution.  The root causes of such abuse lie in deeper societal issues and individual pathology, and addressing them requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma for me.  I'm still grappling with the multifaceted implications, finding it difficult to definitively say whether one side is more right than the other.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage itself.  Drawing clear boundaries without causing offense to any group is a formidable task. \n\nMy personal inclination leans towards viewing marriage as a civil union, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious sacraments like baptism, it shouldn't dictate the specific form a marriage takes.  Civil unions, in my view, adequately recognize the commitment between two individuals.\n\nThe government should refrain from  scrutinizing the nature of a union, focusing instead on the fundamental fact that two people have chosen to join together.  If all states can reach a consensus on this matter, I believe they should advocate for federal legislation recognizing civil unions nationwide.\n\nHowever, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment aiming to ban same-sex marriage.  Altering the constitution for this purpose seems disproportionate to the issue. While it holds significant importance for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic measure.  The constitution should be amended only for matters of truly paramount national concern.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has given me a complex perspective on homosexuality. While I value the relationships of my many gay friends, I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to decide its own stance on marriage equality.  Given the diverse political landscapes across the nation, it's natural that states with differing viewpoints will approach this topic in distinct ways.  A state with a predominantly Democratic population might naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and residents of that state should respect the decisions made by their elected representatives.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to live according to their beliefs and values within the framework of their chosen community.  Therefore, I support the right of each state to determine its own marriage laws. I also believe that such a system avoids imposing a single viewpoint on the entire country, allowing for a more nuanced and localized approach to this complex issue.",
            "The concept of privacy online is complex, especially when it comes to student safety. While it's true that platforms like Myspace are intended for public sharing, the potential consequences of posts can be significant. School officials, in their role to ensure a safe learning environment, often have to navigate this delicate balance.\n\nIf information found online indicates a potential threat to student well-being, it's understandable why officials would want to investigate. This isn't about snooping; it's about taking proactive measures to prevent tragedies.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet leaves a permanent digital footprint. What seems like a harmless post today could have repercussions down the line. It's wise to exercise caution and consider the potential impact of our online actions.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with both individuals and institutions to create a safe and secure online space.  Schools must protect their students, and students must understand the implications of their online presence.",
            "The aftermath of September 11th had a profound impact on my views regarding the war. Initially, driven by a deeply personal connection to the tragedy, I strongly supported military intervention. I believed that a forceful response was necessary to punish those responsible and prevent further attacks. However, as time passed, I began to question the wisdom of our actions.\n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding the event, I realized, might have clouded our judgment. We seemed to act impulsively, lacking a comprehensive strategy or understanding of the long-term consequences. The lack of preparation was evident, and the conflict ultimately backfired, failing to achieve its intended objectives.\n\nMy perspective shifted significantly. Observing the ongoing conflict, I was struck by the internal divisions within the region. It became clear that external intervention might be counterproductive if the primary focus should be on fostering unity and stability within the country itself.\n\nThe complexities of war, particularly in that specific context, became more apparent. The cultural and societal differences led to misunderstandings and unintended consequences.  The motivations and goals of all parties involved were deeply intertwined, and the situation was far more nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nReflecting on the war's impact, I see it as a complex and multifaceted failure. While the initial intention might have been noble, the execution was flawed. The lack of a clear plan, the emotional underpinnings, and the cultural misunderstandings all contributed to a situation that continues to be fraught with challenges."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing challenges in maintaining its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues plays a role in this.  \n\nThe Church's traditionally conservative views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception may not resonate with a growing segment of society that holds more progressive beliefs. While the Church is entitled to its positions, these views can appear outdated to some, potentially leading to a disconnect with younger generations and those who find themselves at odds with these doctrines.\n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective on these matters, it might be better positioned to connect with a wider audience and prevent further decline in its following.  \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable or marginalized within a religious institution that opposes these values.\n\nThe Church's stance on such issues can create a sense of exclusion for those who hold differing views, potentially driving them away from the faith.\n\nIt's worth considering if allowing married priests or ordaining women could address some of these concerns and foster a more inclusive environment.  \n\nWhile these measures might not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more relatable and welcoming atmosphere for a broader range of individuals.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unfair to hold people accountable for something inherent to their identity. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhile I've given this topic some thought, it's important to recognize that personal experiences shape our perspectives. I identify as straight, and while I can't fully grasp the complexities of being gay, I can empathize with the desire for equal rights and recognition. \n\nI also believe the federal government should not be involved in regulating personal matters like marriage. It's a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be to protect individual liberties rather than dictate personal choices.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears.  \n\nOne common concern is that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow undermine traditional family structures.  However, the nature of a loving, committed relationship transcends sexual orientation.  Just as a coin has two sides, both sides of the same fundamental value,  heterosexual and homosexual relationships share core elements – commitment, love, and partnership.\n\nBeyond the emotional aspect, there are significant legal and social implications.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry has a profound impact on their access to essential rights and benefits.  For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and property ownership, legally recognized partners are afforded crucial protections that unmarried partners lack.  \n\nThe issue of religious objections is also frequently raised. While individuals are certainly entitled to their beliefs, government policies should not be based on specific religious doctrines.  Segregation based on sexual orientation is unjust and perpetuates inequality.  Marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not a religious sacrament.\n\nFurthermore, studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples.  Arguments suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are somehow disadvantaged are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe federal government has a responsibility to ensure equal rights and protections for all its citizens.  Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, demonstrating that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are valued and respected members of society.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer provided me with valuable insight into the complexities surrounding drug legality. I've observed firsthand that  a substance's legal status doesn't necessarily reflect its potential therapeutic benefits. \n\nWhile I believe making illicit drugs readily accessible to the public is unwise, I do advocate for their controlled use in medical settings.  Many medications, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse, yet they are essential tools for managing pain and other conditions.  Denying potential therapeutic benefits solely based on societal stigma, as is often the case with marijuana, seems counterproductive.  \n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is difficult, as both substances have the potential for abuse. However, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, responsible marijuana use, when properly regulated, may offer therapeutic advantages.  \n\nI envision a gradual approach to marijuana legalization, starting with controlled medical use. This phased implementation would allow for careful monitoring and regulation, mitigating potential risks while allowing patients to access potential benefits. Removing the societal stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to fostering responsible use and encouraging open discussions about its potential applications.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However,  it's essential to recognize that it's not inherently as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting the narrative and promoting responsible use, we can unlock the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana while minimizing potential risks.",
            "The Church has definitely evolved to fit into the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest outfits – cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses.  \n\nIt was quite a routine, especially since I went to a private school where many of my friends also attended church. We'd often see each other there on weekends.  But things have changed. Now, they have a special mass geared towards teenagers, shortened to thirty minutes. People dress much more casually, especially during the summer. I've seen people arrive straight from the beach!  Families rush in late, and even the morning masses, which I used to dress up for, now see people in jeans and khakis.  \n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other aspects of the Church, I primarily observe these changes.  I don't have a deep understanding of the Church's internal politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't believe these issues could have been prevented simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and the attraction towards young children is a complex issue.\n\nI think becoming a priest is a personal choice, and some religions allow married clergy, like the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both faith and marriage, perhaps they could explore other denominations.\n\nMy perspective is that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. People aren't simply \"born\" that way, and it's not solely a result of upbringing.  While circumstances might play a role, genetics seem to be a significant factor, and marriage wouldn't necessarily eliminate that predisposition.\n\nIf the Church was aware of these issues and attempted to cover them up, that would be deeply wrong. However, I don't believe they were always aware of every instance.",
            "The initial concept held some appeal, but the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow.  It seemed as though the Iraq War was, in part, a response to those events. The Bush administration initially linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction - claims that have since been proven false. This deeply troubled me, and frankly, the Iraq War fills me with anger.\n\nThe Bush administration's handling of the situation deeply concerns me. I believe they misled the American people and have yet to acknowledge their actions. Even Colin Powell, who gave that prominent presentation at the UN, has stated that he wasn't fully convinced by the evidence even while delivering it. To me, this constitutes a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense.  I feel the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to diminish its importance, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards war.\n\nThere have been allegations, made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, that the younger Bush had personal motivations for targeting Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration.  It's also been suggested that securing access to energy resources was a contributing factor, a rather manipulative approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe duration of the conflict is unacceptable.  While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further loss of life, the current path forward seems problematic as well.  The proposed solution involves a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, intervening to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could ultimately create further complications.\n\nThe interim government appears to be crumbling, and the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable.  The Prime Minister seems to have limited influence over the political process.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we were actively combating not long ago, now hold significant power within the Iraqi Parliament.  The political landscape is fraught with tension due to these competing factions vying for control.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I acknowledge the initial impetus for the conflict, which stemmed from the tragic events of 9/11, I find myself questioning the continued justification for our involvement.  \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict.  Furthermore, the stated goals of promoting democracy and securing oil resources appear to be at odds with the reality on the ground. The protracted nature of the war has resulted in significant civilian casualties and instability, casting a shadow over our commitment to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe process of nation-building is inherently challenging, and attempting to impose Western democratic ideals upon a culture with deeply rooted traditions may ultimately prove counterproductive. The potential for resentment and resistance to our intervention is a serious concern.  \n\nMoreover, the ongoing conflict has fueled extremist ideologies and exacerbated sectarian tensions, creating a breeding ground for further violence.  While I understand the desire to protect American interests and support our troops, I believe that a sustained military presence in Iraq is not a sustainable solution. \n\nA more measured approach, focused on diplomacy, economic development, and supporting local initiatives for peace and reconciliation, may offer a more promising path forward.",
            "The question of legality regarding this particular issue is one that deeply concerns me. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is paramount. It explicitly delineates the boundaries between religious institutions and governmental authority, and I feel any attempt to encroach upon those boundaries would be a direct violation of this foundational principle.\n\nThose advocating for its criminalization seem to be prioritizing the beliefs of a specific religious group over others. While it's true that certain denominations, such as many Catholics and Christians, oppose it,  it's essential to recognize the diversity of viewpoints within these faiths.  Furthermore, it is not the government's role to dictate what religious organizations can or cannot deem permissible.\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom is a cornerstone of American society. It allows for a multiplicity of beliefs and practices to flourish. Introducing an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very principle, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on individual liberties. \n\nI firmly believe that the government should remain neutral on this matter.  The decision regarding its legality should rest with the respective religious communities, not with elected officials whose personal beliefs may not reflect the diverse perspectives within their constituencies. \n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment is unclear. It's difficult to predict whether it would have a positive or negative effect on society or the economy.  However, it's crucial to prioritize the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and avoid actions that could undermine religious freedom.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  From the outset, there were questions about the government's justification for the invasion.  While the attacks of September 11th understandably sparked a desire for retribution, the connection between those events and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best.  The administration's rhetoric seemed to blur the lines, capitalizing on the public's fear and anger to garner support for military action.\n\nPersonally, I'm deeply opposed to war, particularly preemptive strikes.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War.  A significant number of American soldiers have perished, a tragic consequence of a conflict that seemed to lack clear objectives and a well-defined exit strategy.  The US government's failure to anticipate the post-invasion chaos and the rise of insurgency highlights a lack of foresight and planning.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic government in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved to be a monumental challenge.  This parallels the difficulties faced during the Vietnam War, where the US attempted to impose its political system on a deeply divided nation. Both conflicts demonstrate the complexities of nation-building and the unintended consequences of intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq has dragged on for years, with significant costs in terms of both American lives and resources.  The training of Iraqi security forces remains a work in progress, and the future of the country remains uncertain. The initial claims about weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded, further fueling skepticism about the government's motives.\n\nThe question of whether the US should continue its involvement in Iraq remains a deeply contentious one.  While some argue for a complete withdrawal, others believe it is crucial to see the conflict through to its conclusion.  Ultimately, the decision involves weighing the human cost against the potential benefits of a stable and democratic Iraq.  It is a decision that demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and growing evidence suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis rather than being solely a sociological construct.  \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control seems fundamentally unjust.  I believe government should not interfere in these personal matters. Marriage is a private affair, a decision made between two people, not a matter for public or governmental intervention.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and raise families, just like any other couple. They contribute to our community and deserve the same recognition and legal protections as everyone else.  \n\nThe idea that political figures should dictate who can and cannot marry based on their interpretation of religious texts feels both antiquated and intrusive.  \n\nScientific research increasingly points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, suggesting it's not a choice but an inherent aspect of a person's identity.  This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current situation highlights a double standard. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without public scrutiny, while same-sex couples face intense media attention and societal judgment simply for seeking the same right. Marriage should be a private and personal matter, not a public spectacle.",
            "The nature of online platforms necessitates a careful consideration of the content we share. Once something is posted on the internet, it enters a public domain accessible to a vast audience. This accessibility carries significant implications, as online content can shape perceptions and influence opinions. \n\nAs someone who has worked in a residential advisor role, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online postings.  Expressing thoughts about harmful actions, even in jest, can be misconstrued and lead to serious repercussions. Schools, for example,  have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and may act upon information gleaned from online platforms if it raises concerns.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential for misuse of online information, it's equally crucial to recognize the importance of responsible disclosure.\n\nIndividuals should be mindful of the permanence of online content and consider the potential impact it may have on their reputation and relationships. Schools, while obligated to address potential threats, should navigate this delicate balance with sensitivity and respect for student privacy.",
            "The prolonged nature of the conflict deeply concerns me. While the initial aims, restoring democracy in a nation lacking fair governance, seemed noble, I believe we have strayed from that original purpose. The conflict now feels driven by an urge to assert global dominance, a pursuit of power rather than principle.\n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's initiation.  The historical tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein raise doubts about the purity of the original intentions.  If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a country lacking a just political system, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, it undermines the moral basis of the war.\n\nThe initial stages, the decisive military action, conveyed a powerful message. Yet, the conflict's continued escalation, stretching for years, seems excessive.  \n\nIf our goal was to liberate a nation under a tyrannical regime, then it was a worthy endeavor. However, I fear our rationale has become muddled and distorted over time. We appear to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than a just resolution.\n\nThe conflict has undoubtedly lingered long enough. It's time for the nation to take responsibility for its own future. We've been draining our economy, spending billions while neglecting domestic issues like poverty and inadequate infrastructure. These are pressing concerns that deserve our financial attention.\n\nBillions are being funneled into a prolonged war, diverting resources from crucial domestic needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.  These are areas that require immediate attention and investment.\n\nSpending taxpayer money on a conflict that has lost its original purpose is morally and financially irresponsible. It's time to end this war and redirect our resources towards addressing the critical challenges facing our own nation.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one. While it's true that information shared publicly on platforms like Myspace is accessible to anyone, the question arises about the boundaries of acceptable access.  \n\nFor instance, while a user might choose to make their profile visible to friends, it's unsettling to consider the potential for individuals to exploit this openness for malicious purposes. The scenario you described, where someone's online activity prevented a potentially dangerous situation, raises ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhile it's impractical to monitor every student's profile constantly, the possibility of targeted monitoring in specific circumstances, such as when there are credible threats, presents a difficult balance between security and individual privacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it disconcerting that personal information can be so readily accessible online.  I've encountered situations where strangers have contacted me through platforms like Facebook, possessing details about me that they shouldn't have.  \n\nThis highlights the vulnerability of online spaces and the need for caution. While these platforms offer valuable opportunities for communication and connection, it's crucial to be mindful of the information we share and the potential consequences.\n\nThe situation you mentioned regarding high schools banning Myspace is also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions have the authority to regulate students' online activities outside of school grounds.  This issue touches upon the evolving nature of privacy in the digital age and the challenges of navigating these complex boundaries.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift to the current realities and potential solutions.  \n\nA significant global consensus, reflected in polls conducted both within the United States, Iraq, and internationally, indicates a strong belief that the war was a misguided endeavor. This sentiment is shared by a majority of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who advocate for a swift withdrawal.  \n\nThe war's consequences have been undeniably devastating, both before and after our involvement. The intricate cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East pose significant challenges to effective engagement.  Imposing democratic ideals on a region with its own distinct cultural and historical context has proven to be a problematic approach.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential repercussions. The current situation necessitates a strategic and measured withdrawal. \n\nDespite the administration's potential arguments for continued presence, I believe a phased withdrawal over the course of a year or slightly longer would be a more responsible course of action.  \n\nUltimately, the Iraqi people themselves have a crucial stake in their future. If we were to consult them directly and they expressed a desire for our departure, it would be both ethically responsible and acknowledge their right to self-determination. While this may present challenges, it would ultimately be a more transparent and potentially more constructive approach.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it manifests in ways that extend beyond traditional gender roles. While women continue to face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to societal biases and the \"glass ceiling,\" men also encounter discrimination in certain fields. \n\nFor example, stay-at-home fathers often face societal pressure and judgment for not adhering to traditional masculine roles, despite their desire to prioritize family life. Similarly, men in the fashion industry sometimes struggle to be taken seriously due to prevailing stereotypes about masculinity and creative expression.\n\nThese examples illustrate that gender discrimination is not a monolithic issue but rather a complex web of societal perceptions and expectations that can disadvantage individuals based on their gender and chosen path. \n\nProgress has been made in challenging these biases, with women increasingly entering leadership positions and stay-at-home fathers gaining greater acceptance. However, change is gradual, and continued efforts are needed to dismantle deeply ingrained societal norms and promote equality for all.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex. While some advocate for full legalization, others, particularly in financially struggling communities, oppose it due to the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration. Decriminalization, on the other hand, shifts the focus from criminal penalties to civil citations, similar to traffic violations. \n\nThis approach reduces the severity of consequences while still acknowledging the potential for misuse.  Supporters of decriminalization argue that it frees up resources for municipalities to invest in vital public services like education, social programs, and homelessness assistance. They also contend that it addresses the societal stigma surrounding marijuana use, allowing for a more open and honest discussion about its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, opponents express concerns about the normalization of marijuana use and potential for increased accessibility, leading to public health and safety issues. They worry about the influence on youth, the potential for impaired driving, and the normalization of drug use in general.\n\nThe economic impact of marijuana legalization or decriminalization is a significant factor in the debate. Proponents highlight the potential for tax revenue and job creation, while opponents emphasize the costs associated with potential increases in healthcare expenses, addiction treatment, and social services.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana involves a careful consideration of various societal, economic, and ethical factors.",
            "While I recognize the value of tradition and the historical significance of the Catholic Church's practices, I believe there are aspects of their doctrine that need to be re-evaluated in light of modern values. \n\nOne area of concern is the rigidity surrounding religious observance. While I understand the importance of faith, I feel that a more inclusive approach to religious practice would be beneficial. For instance, the expectation that every Catholic attend mass weekly and adhere strictly to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion towards those who don't perfectly conform. \n\nThis lack of acceptance extends to individuals of other faiths.  My own parents experienced this firsthand when they were denied a Catholic marriage due to my father's Episcopalian background. This incident highlights a hypocrisy in the Church's teachings, as loving others is a core principle yet, in practice, acceptance of those outside the Catholic faith is limited.\n\nThe discrepancy between doctrine and practice is also evident in the ongoing debate surrounding priestly celibacy. While the Church maintains this requirement, many argue that allowing priests to marry could potentially address concerns about abuse of power.  \n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the issue of abuse is complex and multifaceted. While some might argue that permitting marriage could potentially mitigate certain risks, it is unlikely to be a complete solution.  The root causes of such abuse lie in deeper societal issues and individual pathology, and addressing them requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma for me.  I'm still grappling with the multifaceted implications, finding it difficult to definitively say whether one side is more right than the other.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage itself.  Drawing clear boundaries without causing offense to any group is a formidable task. \n\nMy personal inclination leans towards viewing marriage as a civil union, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious sacraments like baptism, it shouldn't dictate the specific form a marriage takes.  Civil unions, in my view, adequately recognize the commitment between two individuals.\n\nThe government should refrain from  scrutinizing the nature of a union, focusing instead on the fundamental fact that two people have chosen to join together.  If all states can reach a consensus on this matter, I believe they should advocate for federal legislation recognizing civil unions nationwide.\n\nHowever, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment aiming to ban same-sex marriage.  Altering the constitution for this purpose seems disproportionate to the issue. While it holds significant importance for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic measure.  The constitution should be amended only for matters of truly paramount national concern.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has given me a complex perspective on homosexuality. While I value the relationships of my many gay friends, I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to decide its own stance on marriage equality.  Given the diverse political landscapes across the nation, it's natural that states with differing viewpoints will approach this topic in distinct ways.  A state with a predominantly Democratic population might naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and residents of that state should respect the decisions made by their elected representatives.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to live according to their beliefs and values within the framework of their chosen community.  Therefore, I support the right of each state to determine its own marriage laws. I also believe that such a system avoids imposing a single viewpoint on the entire country, allowing for a more nuanced and localized approach to this complex issue.",
            "The concept of privacy online is complex, especially when it comes to student safety. While it's true that platforms like Myspace are intended for public sharing, the potential consequences of posts can be significant. School officials, in their role to ensure a safe learning environment, often have to navigate this delicate balance.\n\nIf information found online indicates a potential threat to student well-being, it's understandable why officials would want to investigate. This isn't about snooping; it's about taking proactive measures to prevent tragedies.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet leaves a permanent digital footprint. What seems like a harmless post today could have repercussions down the line. It's wise to exercise caution and consider the potential impact of our online actions.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with both individuals and institutions to create a safe and secure online space.  Schools must protect their students, and students must understand the implications of their online presence.",
            "The aftermath of September 11th had a profound impact on my views regarding the war. Initially, driven by a deeply personal connection to the tragedy, I strongly supported military intervention. I believed that a forceful response was necessary to punish those responsible and prevent further attacks. However, as time passed, I began to question the wisdom of our actions.\n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding the event, I realized, might have clouded our judgment. We seemed to act impulsively, lacking a comprehensive strategy or understanding of the long-term consequences. The lack of preparation was evident, and the conflict ultimately backfired, failing to achieve its intended objectives.\n\nMy perspective shifted significantly. Observing the ongoing conflict, I was struck by the internal divisions within the region. It became clear that external intervention might be counterproductive if the primary focus should be on fostering unity and stability within the country itself.\n\nThe complexities of war, particularly in that specific context, became more apparent. The cultural and societal differences led to misunderstandings and unintended consequences.  The motivations and goals of all parties involved were deeply intertwined, and the situation was far more nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nReflecting on the war's impact, I see it as a complex and multifaceted failure. While the initial intention might have been noble, the execution was flawed. The lack of a clear plan, the emotional underpinnings, and the cultural misunderstandings all contributed to a situation that continues to be fraught with challenges."
