            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues is a contributing factor.  The Church's views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are considered traditional by some, but they may appear outdated to a younger generation.  \n\nMany people feel that the Church's rigid stance on these issues creates a sense of exclusion and discourages individuals who hold different beliefs. This disconnect can lead to disillusionment and a loss of faith. \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might find it difficult to reconcile their beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, someone who is gay or lesbian might feel unwelcome in a community that does not accept their relationship.\n\nThe Church's position on these matters hinders its ability to connect with a diverse and evolving society. Adopting a more inclusive and progressive approach might help the Church retain its relevance and attract new members.\n\nWhile some may argue that these are matters of faith and tradition, it is important to recognize that social norms and values are constantly changing. The Church should strive to engage with these changes and adapt its teachings accordingly to remain a relevant and meaningful institution.",

I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unjust to discriminate against individuals based on something they were born with.  \n\nDenying same-sex couples the right to marry sends a message that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships. This is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nI don't believe the federal government should intervene in personal matters like marriage.  It's a private decision between two consenting adults.  Government involvement in such matters seems unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nUltimately, I think it's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, and that includes supporting the right of same-sex couples to marry.",
            "Marriage equality is a matter of fundamental fairness. There isn't a valid reason to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections afforded to heterosexual couples.  \n\nSome argue that allowing same-sex marriage threatens the traditional family structure. However, this perspective overlooks the diversity of family forms and conflates marriage with a specific religious or social construct.  Marriage, at its core, is a legal and societal recognition of a committed relationship.  \n\nDenying marriage rights to same-sex couples creates significant legal and social inequalities. For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and taxation, partners in same-sex relationships often lack the same protections as married couples.  These disparities can have profound consequences for individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, many studies have demonstrated that same-sex relationships are just as stable and fulfilling as heterosexual relationships.  The factors contributing to relationship success are not determined by sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between religious beliefs and civil law.  While some religious institutions may oppose same-sex marriage, the government should uphold the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious views.  \n\nThe argument that same-sex marriage will negatively impact children is unfounded.  Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nOpposition to marriage equality often stems from prejudice and misinformation.  \n\nIt's crucial to rely on evidence-based research and to promote understanding and acceptance of all individuals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is a matter of social justice and equality for all.",
            "During my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I encountered a common misconception: the assumption that illegality automatically equates to inherent harm.  While I firmly believe drugs should not be readily available to the public, I do advocate for their medicinal use.  The legality of a substance does not dictate its potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, utilized in pharmacies for their proven medical benefits.  To deny those benefits simply because of societal stigma surrounding marijuana is illogical. We should embrace its potential therapeutic value.\n\nDrawing parallels to alcohol, while both substances can be misused, marijuana's potential for harm appears less severe.  A gradual integration of marijuana into a regulated system, rather than immediate legalization, might be prudent to mitigate potential abuse.  However, dismantling the negative stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to foster responsible use.\n\nThe perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug is largely driven by its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that its effects are not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting public perception and acknowledging its potential benefits, we can create a more informed and responsible approach to marijuana use, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "The church has definitely made some adjustments to better suit life in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back, when I was younger, church attendance was a regular Sunday ritual. I remember always dressing up—cute dresses, matching shoes and purses—the whole nine yards. That was the norm back then. Attending a private school meant seeing all my friends at church on weekends. We'd just go, you know, hang out.\n\nBut things have changed as I've gotten older. They've introduced a more casual \"teenager mass\" that's condensed to just thirty minutes. People dress a lot more relaxed now, especially in the summer when beachgoers might show up straight from the sand. Families often arrive late, adding to the laid-back vibe. Even at the morning masses, where I used to be quite formal, you see more jeans and khakis these days.  \n\nI'd say the biggest change is the shift towards casual attire. That's the most noticeable difference I've seen in my church. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about the internal politics of the church or anything like that.\n\nAs for the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't believe those things could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have inappropriate attractions towards children. I think it's about the individual, not their marital status. Becoming a priest is a personal choice. There are other religions, like those portrayed on TV shows, where clergy are allowed to marry. If someone deeply wants to practice their faith and be married, they could perhaps consider those alternatives.\n\nI think pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. It's not something people simply choose; it's more likely a biological predisposition.  While upbringing might play a role, I believe genetics are a major factor.  Marriage wouldn't hide that; it might even bring it to the surface eventually. \n\nIf the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's truly wrong. But I don't think they were always aware of everything.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War wasn't inherently problematic, but the context of the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow. It seemed the U.S. government used the tragedy as a springboard to justify pretexts for military action. The Bush administration made connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been debunked. This has deeply troubled me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions feel like a betrayal of the American public.  Even Colin Powell, who delivered a pivotal presentation at the UN, now acknowledges he lacked conviction in the presented evidence at the time. This, in my view, constitutes malfeasance and potentially impeachable offenses.  \n\nThe Bush administration's general disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11, is also deeply concerning.  There's a sense that they entered office with a preconceived notion of engaging in warfare. This is supported by allegations made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, who, after his departure from office, detailed this intent in his book.\n\nThe younger Bush appeared to harbor a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and perhaps sought to secure energy resources in the long term. This approach feels manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has undoubtedly dragged on too long, an immediate withdrawal could lead to further instability, potentially triggering a civil war with catastrophic consequences. The UN and the U.S. seem to be exploring an alternative: a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, this solution raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and future. The current interim government appears to be faltering, and the political process is fraught with tension.\n\nNews reports indicate the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable, with the Prime Minister seemingly lacking true control.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict with, now hold significant political power.  Radical factions continue to vie for control, exacerbating the political climate.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue. Its origin can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11, with many believing it was a response to the terrorist attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has sparked debate about its legitimacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to form a definitive stance on the war. While I understand the desire to combat terrorism and promote democracy, I am also concerned about the long-term consequences of our involvement. The war has had a profound impact on Iraqi society, leading to instability and displacement. \n\nThe complexities of establishing a functioning democracy in a nation with a long history of authoritarian rule are significant. Furthermore, the presence of foreign troops can exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment, potentially hindering the establishment of lasting peace.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the human cost of war, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The economic burden on the United States is also a factor. While the stated goals of the war may be noble, it's essential to analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs. \n\nUltimately, finding a resolution to the conflict that promotes stability, justice, and self-determination for the Iraqi people remains a significant challenge.",
            "The issue of  legality surrounding this particular topic is one that I believe should remain with religious institutions. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a fundamental cornerstone of our nation, clearly outlining the boundaries between governmental authority and religious practice. \n\nAny attempt by the government to impose its will on this matter would be a direct violation of this established principle. It would essentially amount to choosing one religious viewpoint over another, which is not the role of the government. While certain denominations may hold strong convictions against this practice, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs within various faiths.\n\nFurthermore, the very concept of amending the Constitution to address this issue raises serious concerns.  Amending such a foundational document should be reserved for matters of utmost national importance, not for addressing the specific tenets of individual religions. Additionally, an amendment aimed at restricting this practice would be unprecedented, as most amendments serve to limit governmental power rather than individual freedoms.\n\nI firmly believe that this matter should be left to the guidance and discretion of religious organizations. The government has no place in dictating the internal affairs of churches or other religious bodies.  It's essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom and allow each faith to determine its own stance on this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq remains a complex and deeply troubling issue. From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency. While the tragic events of September 11th understandably fueled a desire for action, the connection between those attacks and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best. This, I fear, was exploited to manipulate public sentiment.\n\nPersonally, I am fundamentally opposed to preemptive war. The Iraq conflict, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War. The immense loss of American lives is a devastating consequence, and the unintended consequences of removing a nation's leadership were poorly anticipated. The subsequent power vacuum created instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges faced in Vietnam.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic system in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved far more complex than initially envisioned. Just as the US struggled to solidify democracy in its own history, imposing a new political structure on another nation demands patience and a realistic understanding of the long-term commitment required. \n\nThe initial optimism surrounding the invasion seems misplaced, overlooking the inherent difficulties of nation-building.  The ongoing presence of US troops, the continued training of Iraqi security forces, and the persistent threat of insurgency highlight the enduring complexities of the situation. \n\nFurthermore, the question of motive arises. While the stated goal was to spread democracy, the significant oil reserves of Iraq cannot be ignored. The lack of conclusive evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the continued reliance on oil from the region, raises concerns about the transparency and genuine motivations behind the conflict.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is a stark reminder of the profound consequences of war, both for those directly involved and for the international community. I hope for a swift and peaceful resolution, but acknowledge the grim reality that lasting stability may be elusive.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and evidence increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has biological roots rather than purely sociological ones.  Denying individuals rights based on something they cannot control is fundamentally unjust. \n\nI believe personal relationships, including marriage, should be private matters, free from government interference. Politics and legislation have no place in dictating who can and cannot love whom.  Observing diverse families in my own community, such as openly gay couples who live and function just like any other family, reinforces this belief.\n\nRecent studies and reports indicate that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors, potentially even predisposed at birth. This further strengthens the argument against societal or legal restrictions. \n\nThe double standard surrounding marriage is stark. Heterosexual couples can choose to marry privately, while same-sex couples face public scrutiny and legal barriers. This discrepancy highlights the need for equal rights and recognition for all loving couples.  Marriage should be a personal and private matter, not subject to political or national regulations.",
            "The internet operates as a public platform, meaning anything shared there is accessible to a broad audience. As a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts have significantly influenced perceptions of individuals.  \n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential consequences of what we share online. Posts about sensitive topics, such as violence or threats, can be misinterpreted and lead to serious repercussions. \n\nWhile it's natural to express ourselves freely, it's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact.  One never knows who might see what we post, and even seemingly harmless content can be taken out of context.\n\nThere are instances where concerns raised about online activity are legitimate, such as when a student's posts express potential danger to themselves or others. In such cases, school officials may need to investigate to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nHowever, it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy. Blindly monitoring students' online activity without proper justification is a breach of trust.  \n\nUltimately, individuals should be mindful of their online presence and understand that their digital footprint can have lasting consequences.",
            "The conflict has undoubtedly persisted for an excessive duration. While the initial intent, aimed at establishing democratic principles in a nation lacking a fair political system, appeared noble, I believe we have strayed from that original objective. \n\nIt seems we might be engaged in the war simply to assert our global dominance, a pursuit that raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the war's genesis could be linked to pre-existing tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein, casting a shadow of doubt on the initial motivations. \n\nIf the goal truly was to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, the war's legitimacy diminishes considerably. \n\nRegardless, the conflict has dragged on far too long. The initial military action, while forceful, conveyed a clear message. However, the prolonged engagement, spanning several years, has lost its initial purpose. \n\nIf our aim was to liberate a nation from tyranny, that was a worthy goal. But over time, I fear our objectives have become muddled and misguided. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a lasting resolution. \n\nThe war's financial burden is also a significant concern. Billions are being poured into a conflict that has outlived its usefulness. These resources could be better allocated to addressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other pressing social needs. \n\nIt's time to end this war. The Iraqi government and its officials must ultimately take responsibility for their own nation. We have fulfilled our initial purpose and should prioritize our own citizens' well-being.",
            "The concept of online privacy is a complex one. While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, the question of to what extent schools can regulate students' online activities is debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, students who choose to share personal information online should be aware that it may be viewed by a wider audience. This includes potential risks, such as encountering individuals with malicious intent.  The example of the man who used online information to manipulate a young woman highlights the dangers that can arise from readily accessible personal data.\n\nHowever, banning social media entirely seems like a heavy-handed approach.  Students need to learn how to navigate the digital world responsibly, and outright prohibition may not be the most effective solution.  It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom and the school's responsibility to protect its students.\n\nPerhaps a more nuanced approach would involve educating students about online safety and privacy best practices, rather than resorting to blanket bans. This could empower them to make informed decisions about their online presence and minimize potential risks.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue, and my initial stance against it aligns with the prevailing public opinion, which overwhelmingly considers it a mistake.  \n\nSurveys conducted across the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a consistent sentiment:  a significant majority, ranging from seventy-five to eighty percent, believe the war was a poor decision. This includes a large portion of U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, who also express a desire for withdrawal within a year.\n\nThe conflict has undeniably been a source of turmoil since its inception, and the prospect of withdrawal presents its own set of challenges.  The Middle East's cultural complexities and differing values pose significant obstacles to achieving lasting stability through direct intervention.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive,  the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential consequences, which have unfolded as a multifaceted disaster.  \n\nDespite the administration's justifications for remaining in Iraq, I find them unconvincing. A gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer might be more manageable, but the fundamental question remains:  what legitimate reason compels us to remain beyond that point?  \n\nThe Iraqi people themselves have voiced their desire for our departure, with a significant portion advocating for immediate withdrawal. Their perspectives, as those most directly affected, deserve considerable weight. \n\nLeaving Iraq while acknowledging their autonomy, even if it leads to unforeseen challenges, could ultimately be more ethically sound than continuing a protracted presence that is increasingly viewed as detrimental by both the Iraqi people and a large segment of the American public.",
            "Gender discrimination persists in the United States, although it's not limited to women. The specific field of work often plays a significant role. While women generally face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also encounter prejudice. For instance, societal expectations often pressure men to be the primary breadwinner, leading to judgment when they choose to stay home with children.\n\nSimilarly, the fashion industry presents unique hurdles for men. They may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable about fashion if they don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. This highlights how deeply ingrained societal norms can influence perceptions and opportunities, regardless of gender.\n\nProgress has been made in challenging these discriminatory practices. Women are increasingly attaining leadership positions, and the acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is growing. However, change is gradual. By highlighting the strengths and experiences of those who are often stereotyped, and by promoting inclusivity, we can continue to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society.  \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that discrimination can extend beyond gender. Factors like socioeconomic background and education level can also play a role. For example, someone with exceptional intelligence but limited formal education might face prejudice based on their communication style. This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of discrimination and the need for a holistic approach to addressing it.",
            "The legalization debate around marijuana is complex. While it hasn't been fully legalized in all areas, many places have chosen to decriminalize it. This means that possession of small amounts is treated less severely than a criminal offense, akin to a traffic violation.  \n\nWhile decriminalization does lessen the immediate legal repercussions, concerns remain about the long-term consequences.  A criminal record, even for a minor offense, can still impact job prospects and other opportunities. \n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the financial burden of arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is substantial.  They contend that these resources could be better allocated to areas like education, social programs, and public health. \n\nUrban centers with progressive viewpoints, like Denver, have often taken this approach, believing that decriminalization can free up funds for essential services.  \n\nThe debate also touches on the social implications of marijuana use. Some worry that full legalization might lead to increased public consumption, potentially impacting social norms and safety. It raises questions about the regulation and control of marijuana sales and its accessibility to minors.\n\nUltimately, the debate revolves around balancing individual liberties with societal concerns, weighing the potential benefits of decriminalization against the perceived risks of increased usage and its impact on communities.",
            "My perspective on the Catholic Church is complex. While I appreciate its enduring traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's approach to inclusivity.  While the teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices seem to contradict this message. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage was not permitted in the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian faith. This experience highlighted what I perceive as a lack of tolerance towards those outside the Catholic tradition. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that the Church's strict adherence to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion for those who don't perfectly align with its tenets. This rigidity, coupled with a resistance to change, can be discouraging for individuals seeking a more welcoming and understanding faith community. \n\nI recognize that the issue of priestly celibacy is a sensitive one, and I understand the arguments both for and against it. While allowing priests to marry might address certain concerns, I believe the root cause of misconduct lies within individuals and not solely within their marital status.  The problem of abuse is a serious one that requires multifaceted solutions, and addressing it effectively necessitates a focus on accountability, prevention, and support for survivors.",
            "This issue is incredibly complex, and I haven't fully formed my opinion on it yet. It's difficult to definitively say which side is right or wrong because it touches on such sensitive areas like the separation of church and state and the very definition of marriage. \n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's beliefs while ensuring fairness is a significant challenge.  \n\nPersonally, I believe civil unions should be recognized and respected.  Perhaps defining marriage as solely a civil contract, separate from religious interpretations, could be a way forward. After all, the government doesn't intervene in religious practices like baptism, so it seems logical to treat marriage similarly. \n\nIf two people are committed to each other, their union should be legally recognized regardless of their religious beliefs.  The government shouldn't be involved in dictating the nature of a marriage, as long as it's a legally binding civil union.\n\nIdeally, a nationwide consensus on this issue would lead to federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage seems extreme. The constitution shouldn't be amended lightly, especially for something as personal and deeply held as marriage. While this is a significant issue for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic change to the fundamental law of the land.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully endorse that lifestyle. However, I believe marriage equality should be a right granted to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nI think this is a matter best decided at the state level rather than imposed nationally. Different states have diverse demographics and values, reflected in their political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states are more likely to support same-sex marriage, and residents within those states should have their voices heard on this issue.\n\nIf you choose to reside in a state that legalizes gay marriage, you're essentially accepting that state's stance.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equal opportunities for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community.  I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, but I feel it should be a decision made by individual states based on the will of their citizens. \n\nThe federal government shouldn't dictate this deeply personal issue for every state.  A president's personal views shouldn't determine the rights of citizens across the nation.  Furthermore, with the possibility of a change in presidential administration in the near future, this ongoing debate over a federal ban seems unproductive.\n\nAllowing states to decide on this issue allows for a more nuanced and respectful approach to this complex social topic.",
            "The concept of privacy in a digital world is complex, particularly when it intersects with school safety. While I understand the argument that accessing student profiles on platforms like Myspace constitutes an invasion of privacy, I believe the school's responsibility to ensure a secure learning environment should be paramount. \n\nStudents using public platforms should be aware that their online activity isn't entirely private.  If information posted online could potentially threaten the safety of the school community, it's reasonable for authorities to investigate.  \n\nThe school's actions, while perhaps appearing intrusive, are ultimately aimed at preventing harm.  Just as schools conduct drills to prepare for emergencies, they should utilize all available resources, including online monitoring, to mitigate potential threats.  \n\nFurthermore, the internet's permanence means that online posts can have lasting consequences.  Students should exercise caution and consider the potential repercussions of their online activity.  After all, actions have consequences, both online and offline.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective.  Initially, I strongly supported military intervention, feeling a sense of righteous anger and a need for retribution. However, as time passed, my views evolved. I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\nIt became clear to me that our response was largely driven by emotion rather than a well-thought-out plan. We entered the conflict unprepared, lacking a clear understanding of the complexities of the region and the potential ramifications of our involvement. This lack of preparedness has arguably backfired, exacerbating the situation and hindering progress towards peace and stability.\n\nI now believe that our continued presence in the region is counterproductive.  The internal conflicts and divisions among the local populations make it difficult to establish a lasting solution. It appears that our efforts to impose change have been met with resistance, and our presence may be contributing to further instability.\n\nIt's important to recognize that war is a brutal and complex issue, and there are no easy answers. While I understand the initial impulse to retaliate after the tragedies of 9/11, I now believe that a more nuanced and strategic approach is necessary. We need to prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and long-term solutions that address the root causes of instability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues is a contributing factor.  The Church's views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are considered traditional by some, but they may appear outdated to a younger generation.  \n\nMany people feel that the Church's rigid stance on these issues creates a sense of exclusion and discourages individuals who hold different beliefs. This disconnect can lead to disillusionment and a loss of faith. \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might find it difficult to reconcile their beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, someone who is gay or lesbian might feel unwelcome in a community that does not accept their relationship.\n\nThe Church's position on these matters hinders its ability to connect with a diverse and evolving society. Adopting a more inclusive and progressive approach might help the Church retain its relevance and attract new members.\n\nWhile some may argue that these are matters of faith and tradition, it is important to recognize that social norms and values are constantly changing. The Church should strive to engage with these changes and adapt its teachings accordingly to remain a relevant and meaningful institution.",
            "I believe that everyone deserves equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unjust to discriminate against individuals based on something they were born with.  \n\nDenying same-sex couples the right to marry sends a message that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships. This is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nI don't believe the federal government should intervene in personal matters like marriage.  It's a private decision between two consenting adults.  Government involvement in such matters seems unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nUltimately, I think it's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, and that includes supporting the right of same-sex couples to marry.",
            "Marriage equality is a matter of fundamental fairness. There isn't a valid reason to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections afforded to heterosexual couples.  \n\nSome argue that allowing same-sex marriage threatens the traditional family structure. However, this perspective overlooks the diversity of family forms and conflates marriage with a specific religious or social construct.  Marriage, at its core, is a legal and societal recognition of a committed relationship.  \n\nDenying marriage rights to same-sex couples creates significant legal and social inequalities. For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and taxation, partners in same-sex relationships often lack the same protections as married couples.  These disparities can have profound consequences for individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, many studies have demonstrated that same-sex relationships are just as stable and fulfilling as heterosexual relationships.  The factors contributing to relationship success are not determined by sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between religious beliefs and civil law.  While some religious institutions may oppose same-sex marriage, the government should uphold the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious views.  \n\nThe argument that same-sex marriage will negatively impact children is unfounded.  Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nOpposition to marriage equality often stems from prejudice and misinformation.  \n\nIt's crucial to rely on evidence-based research and to promote understanding and acceptance of all individuals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is a matter of social justice and equality for all.",
            "During my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I encountered a common misconception: the assumption that illegality automatically equates to inherent harm.  While I firmly believe drugs should not be readily available to the public, I do advocate for their medicinal use.  The legality of a substance does not dictate its potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, utilized in pharmacies for their proven medical benefits.  To deny those benefits simply because of societal stigma surrounding marijuana is illogical. We should embrace its potential therapeutic value.\n\nDrawing parallels to alcohol, while both substances can be misused, marijuana's potential for harm appears less severe.  A gradual integration of marijuana into a regulated system, rather than immediate legalization, might be prudent to mitigate potential abuse.  However, dismantling the negative stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to foster responsible use.\n\nThe perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug is largely driven by its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that its effects are not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting public perception and acknowledging its potential benefits, we can create a more informed and responsible approach to marijuana use, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "The church has definitely made some adjustments to better suit life in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back, when I was younger, church attendance was a regular Sunday ritual. I remember always dressing up—cute dresses, matching shoes and purses—the whole nine yards. That was the norm back then. Attending a private school meant seeing all my friends at church on weekends. We'd just go, you know, hang out.\n\nBut things have changed as I've gotten older. They've introduced a more casual \"teenager mass\" that's condensed to just thirty minutes. People dress a lot more relaxed now, especially in the summer when beachgoers might show up straight from the sand. Families often arrive late, adding to the laid-back vibe. Even at the morning masses, where I used to be quite formal, you see more jeans and khakis these days.  \n\nI'd say the biggest change is the shift towards casual attire. That's the most noticeable difference I've seen in my church. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about the internal politics of the church or anything like that.\n\nAs for the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't believe those things could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have inappropriate attractions towards children. I think it's about the individual, not their marital status. Becoming a priest is a personal choice. There are other religions, like those portrayed on TV shows, where clergy are allowed to marry. If someone deeply wants to practice their faith and be married, they could perhaps consider those alternatives.\n\nI think pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. It's not something people simply choose; it's more likely a biological predisposition.  While upbringing might play a role, I believe genetics are a major factor.  Marriage wouldn't hide that; it might even bring it to the surface eventually. \n\nIf the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's truly wrong. But I don't think they were always aware of everything.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War wasn't inherently problematic, but the context of the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow. It seemed the U.S. government used the tragedy as a springboard to justify pretexts for military action. The Bush administration made connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been debunked. This has deeply troubled me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions feel like a betrayal of the American public.  Even Colin Powell, who delivered a pivotal presentation at the UN, now acknowledges he lacked conviction in the presented evidence at the time. This, in my view, constitutes malfeasance and potentially impeachable offenses.  \n\nThe Bush administration's general disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11, is also deeply concerning.  There's a sense that they entered office with a preconceived notion of engaging in warfare. This is supported by allegations made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, who, after his departure from office, detailed this intent in his book.\n\nThe younger Bush appeared to harbor a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and perhaps sought to secure energy resources in the long term. This approach feels manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has undoubtedly dragged on too long, an immediate withdrawal could lead to further instability, potentially triggering a civil war with catastrophic consequences. The UN and the U.S. seem to be exploring an alternative: a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, this solution raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and future. The current interim government appears to be faltering, and the political process is fraught with tension.\n\nNews reports indicate the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable, with the Prime Minister seemingly lacking true control.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict with, now hold significant political power.  Radical factions continue to vie for control, exacerbating the political climate.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue. Its origin can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11, with many believing it was a response to the terrorist attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has sparked debate about its legitimacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to form a definitive stance on the war. While I understand the desire to combat terrorism and promote democracy, I am also concerned about the long-term consequences of our involvement. The war has had a profound impact on Iraqi society, leading to instability and displacement. \n\nThe complexities of establishing a functioning democracy in a nation with a long history of authoritarian rule are significant. Furthermore, the presence of foreign troops can exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment, potentially hindering the establishment of lasting peace.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the human cost of war, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The economic burden on the United States is also a factor. While the stated goals of the war may be noble, it's essential to analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs. \n\nUltimately, finding a resolution to the conflict that promotes stability, justice, and self-determination for the Iraqi people remains a significant challenge.",
            "The issue of  legality surrounding this particular topic is one that I believe should remain with religious institutions. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a fundamental cornerstone of our nation, clearly outlining the boundaries between governmental authority and religious practice. \n\nAny attempt by the government to impose its will on this matter would be a direct violation of this established principle. It would essentially amount to choosing one religious viewpoint over another, which is not the role of the government. While certain denominations may hold strong convictions against this practice, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs within various faiths.\n\nFurthermore, the very concept of amending the Constitution to address this issue raises serious concerns.  Amending such a foundational document should be reserved for matters of utmost national importance, not for addressing the specific tenets of individual religions. Additionally, an amendment aimed at restricting this practice would be unprecedented, as most amendments serve to limit governmental power rather than individual freedoms.\n\nI firmly believe that this matter should be left to the guidance and discretion of religious organizations. The government has no place in dictating the internal affairs of churches or other religious bodies.  It's essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom and allow each faith to determine its own stance on this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq remains a complex and deeply troubling issue. From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency. While the tragic events of September 11th understandably fueled a desire for action, the connection between those attacks and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best. This, I fear, was exploited to manipulate public sentiment.\n\nPersonally, I am fundamentally opposed to preemptive war. The Iraq conflict, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War. The immense loss of American lives is a devastating consequence, and the unintended consequences of removing a nation's leadership were poorly anticipated. The subsequent power vacuum created instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges faced in Vietnam.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic system in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved far more complex than initially envisioned. Just as the US struggled to solidify democracy in its own history, imposing a new political structure on another nation demands patience and a realistic understanding of the long-term commitment required. \n\nThe initial optimism surrounding the invasion seems misplaced, overlooking the inherent difficulties of nation-building.  The ongoing presence of US troops, the continued training of Iraqi security forces, and the persistent threat of insurgency highlight the enduring complexities of the situation. \n\nFurthermore, the question of motive arises. While the stated goal was to spread democracy, the significant oil reserves of Iraq cannot be ignored. The lack of conclusive evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the continued reliance on oil from the region, raises concerns about the transparency and genuine motivations behind the conflict.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is a stark reminder of the profound consequences of war, both for those directly involved and for the international community. I hope for a swift and peaceful resolution, but acknowledge the grim reality that lasting stability may be elusive.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and evidence increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has biological roots rather than purely sociological ones.  Denying individuals rights based on something they cannot control is fundamentally unjust. \n\nI believe personal relationships, including marriage, should be private matters, free from government interference. Politics and legislation have no place in dictating who can and cannot love whom.  Observing diverse families in my own community, such as openly gay couples who live and function just like any other family, reinforces this belief.\n\nRecent studies and reports indicate that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors, potentially even predisposed at birth. This further strengthens the argument against societal or legal restrictions. \n\nThe double standard surrounding marriage is stark. Heterosexual couples can choose to marry privately, while same-sex couples face public scrutiny and legal barriers. This discrepancy highlights the need for equal rights and recognition for all loving couples.  Marriage should be a personal and private matter, not subject to political or national regulations.",
            "The internet operates as a public platform, meaning anything shared there is accessible to a broad audience. As a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts have significantly influenced perceptions of individuals.  \n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential consequences of what we share online. Posts about sensitive topics, such as violence or threats, can be misinterpreted and lead to serious repercussions. \n\nWhile it's natural to express ourselves freely, it's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact.  One never knows who might see what we post, and even seemingly harmless content can be taken out of context.\n\nThere are instances where concerns raised about online activity are legitimate, such as when a student's posts express potential danger to themselves or others. In such cases, school officials may need to investigate to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nHowever, it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy. Blindly monitoring students' online activity without proper justification is a breach of trust.  \n\nUltimately, individuals should be mindful of their online presence and understand that their digital footprint can have lasting consequences.",
            "The conflict has undoubtedly persisted for an excessive duration. While the initial intent, aimed at establishing democratic principles in a nation lacking a fair political system, appeared noble, I believe we have strayed from that original objective. \n\nIt seems we might be engaged in the war simply to assert our global dominance, a pursuit that raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the war's genesis could be linked to pre-existing tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein, casting a shadow of doubt on the initial motivations. \n\nIf the goal truly was to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, the war's legitimacy diminishes considerably. \n\nRegardless, the conflict has dragged on far too long. The initial military action, while forceful, conveyed a clear message. However, the prolonged engagement, spanning several years, has lost its initial purpose. \n\nIf our aim was to liberate a nation from tyranny, that was a worthy goal. But over time, I fear our objectives have become muddled and misguided. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a lasting resolution. \n\nThe war's financial burden is also a significant concern. Billions are being poured into a conflict that has outlived its usefulness. These resources could be better allocated to addressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other pressing social needs. \n\nIt's time to end this war. The Iraqi government and its officials must ultimately take responsibility for their own nation. We have fulfilled our initial purpose and should prioritize our own citizens' well-being.",
            "The concept of online privacy is a complex one. While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, the question of to what extent schools can regulate students' online activities is debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, students who choose to share personal information online should be aware that it may be viewed by a wider audience. This includes potential risks, such as encountering individuals with malicious intent.  The example of the man who used online information to manipulate a young woman highlights the dangers that can arise from readily accessible personal data.\n\nHowever, banning social media entirely seems like a heavy-handed approach.  Students need to learn how to navigate the digital world responsibly, and outright prohibition may not be the most effective solution.  It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom and the school's responsibility to protect its students.\n\nPerhaps a more nuanced approach would involve educating students about online safety and privacy best practices, rather than resorting to blanket bans. This could empower them to make informed decisions about their online presence and minimize potential risks.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue, and my initial stance against it aligns with the prevailing public opinion, which overwhelmingly considers it a mistake.  \n\nSurveys conducted across the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a consistent sentiment:  a significant majority, ranging from seventy-five to eighty percent, believe the war was a poor decision. This includes a large portion of U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, who also express a desire for withdrawal within a year.\n\nThe conflict has undeniably been a source of turmoil since its inception, and the prospect of withdrawal presents its own set of challenges.  The Middle East's cultural complexities and differing values pose significant obstacles to achieving lasting stability through direct intervention.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive,  the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential consequences, which have unfolded as a multifaceted disaster.  \n\nDespite the administration's justifications for remaining in Iraq, I find them unconvincing. A gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer might be more manageable, but the fundamental question remains:  what legitimate reason compels us to remain beyond that point?  \n\nThe Iraqi people themselves have voiced their desire for our departure, with a significant portion advocating for immediate withdrawal. Their perspectives, as those most directly affected, deserve considerable weight. \n\nLeaving Iraq while acknowledging their autonomy, even if it leads to unforeseen challenges, could ultimately be more ethically sound than continuing a protracted presence that is increasingly viewed as detrimental by both the Iraqi people and a large segment of the American public.",
            "Gender discrimination persists in the United States, although it's not limited to women. The specific field of work often plays a significant role. While women generally face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also encounter prejudice. For instance, societal expectations often pressure men to be the primary breadwinner, leading to judgment when they choose to stay home with children.\n\nSimilarly, the fashion industry presents unique hurdles for men. They may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable about fashion if they don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. This highlights how deeply ingrained societal norms can influence perceptions and opportunities, regardless of gender.\n\nProgress has been made in challenging these discriminatory practices. Women are increasingly attaining leadership positions, and the acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is growing. However, change is gradual. By highlighting the strengths and experiences of those who are often stereotyped, and by promoting inclusivity, we can continue to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society.  \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that discrimination can extend beyond gender. Factors like socioeconomic background and education level can also play a role. For example, someone with exceptional intelligence but limited formal education might face prejudice based on their communication style. This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of discrimination and the need for a holistic approach to addressing it.",
            "The legalization debate around marijuana is complex. While it hasn't been fully legalized in all areas, many places have chosen to decriminalize it. This means that possession of small amounts is treated less severely than a criminal offense, akin to a traffic violation.  \n\nWhile decriminalization does lessen the immediate legal repercussions, concerns remain about the long-term consequences.  A criminal record, even for a minor offense, can still impact job prospects and other opportunities. \n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the financial burden of arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is substantial.  They contend that these resources could be better allocated to areas like education, social programs, and public health. \n\nUrban centers with progressive viewpoints, like Denver, have often taken this approach, believing that decriminalization can free up funds for essential services.  \n\nThe debate also touches on the social implications of marijuana use. Some worry that full legalization might lead to increased public consumption, potentially impacting social norms and safety. It raises questions about the regulation and control of marijuana sales and its accessibility to minors.\n\nUltimately, the debate revolves around balancing individual liberties with societal concerns, weighing the potential benefits of decriminalization against the perceived risks of increased usage and its impact on communities.",
            "My perspective on the Catholic Church is complex. While I appreciate its enduring traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's approach to inclusivity.  While the teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices seem to contradict this message. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage was not permitted in the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian faith. This experience highlighted what I perceive as a lack of tolerance towards those outside the Catholic tradition. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that the Church's strict adherence to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion for those who don't perfectly align with its tenets. This rigidity, coupled with a resistance to change, can be discouraging for individuals seeking a more welcoming and understanding faith community. \n\nI recognize that the issue of priestly celibacy is a sensitive one, and I understand the arguments both for and against it. While allowing priests to marry might address certain concerns, I believe the root cause of misconduct lies within individuals and not solely within their marital status.  The problem of abuse is a serious one that requires multifaceted solutions, and addressing it effectively necessitates a focus on accountability, prevention, and support for survivors.",
            "This issue is incredibly complex, and I haven't fully formed my opinion on it yet. It's difficult to definitively say which side is right or wrong because it touches on such sensitive areas like the separation of church and state and the very definition of marriage. \n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's beliefs while ensuring fairness is a significant challenge.  \n\nPersonally, I believe civil unions should be recognized and respected.  Perhaps defining marriage as solely a civil contract, separate from religious interpretations, could be a way forward. After all, the government doesn't intervene in religious practices like baptism, so it seems logical to treat marriage similarly. \n\nIf two people are committed to each other, their union should be legally recognized regardless of their religious beliefs.  The government shouldn't be involved in dictating the nature of a marriage, as long as it's a legally binding civil union.\n\nIdeally, a nationwide consensus on this issue would lead to federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage seems extreme. The constitution shouldn't be amended lightly, especially for something as personal and deeply held as marriage. While this is a significant issue for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic change to the fundamental law of the land.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully endorse that lifestyle. However, I believe marriage equality should be a right granted to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nI think this is a matter best decided at the state level rather than imposed nationally. Different states have diverse demographics and values, reflected in their political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states are more likely to support same-sex marriage, and residents within those states should have their voices heard on this issue.\n\nIf you choose to reside in a state that legalizes gay marriage, you're essentially accepting that state's stance.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equal opportunities for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community.  I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, but I feel it should be a decision made by individual states based on the will of their citizens. \n\nThe federal government shouldn't dictate this deeply personal issue for every state.  A president's personal views shouldn't determine the rights of citizens across the nation.  Furthermore, with the possibility of a change in presidential administration in the near future, this ongoing debate over a federal ban seems unproductive.\n\nAllowing states to decide on this issue allows for a more nuanced and respectful approach to this complex social topic.",
            "The concept of privacy in a digital world is complex, particularly when it intersects with school safety. While I understand the argument that accessing student profiles on platforms like Myspace constitutes an invasion of privacy, I believe the school's responsibility to ensure a secure learning environment should be paramount. \n\nStudents using public platforms should be aware that their online activity isn't entirely private.  If information posted online could potentially threaten the safety of the school community, it's reasonable for authorities to investigate.  \n\nThe school's actions, while perhaps appearing intrusive, are ultimately aimed at preventing harm.  Just as schools conduct drills to prepare for emergencies, they should utilize all available resources, including online monitoring, to mitigate potential threats.  \n\nFurthermore, the internet's permanence means that online posts can have lasting consequences.  Students should exercise caution and consider the potential repercussions of their online activity.  After all, actions have consequences, both online and offline.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective.  Initially, I strongly supported military intervention, feeling a sense of righteous anger and a need for retribution. However, as time passed, my views evolved. I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\nIt became clear to me that our response was largely driven by emotion rather than a well-thought-out plan. We entered the conflict unprepared, lacking a clear understanding of the complexities of the region and the potential ramifications of our involvement. This lack of preparedness has arguably backfired, exacerbating the situation and hindering progress towards peace and stability.\n\nI now believe that our continued presence in the region is counterproductive.  The internal conflicts and divisions among the local populations make it difficult to establish a lasting solution. It appears that our efforts to impose change have been met with resistance, and our presence may be contributing to further instability.\n\nIt's important to recognize that war is a brutal and complex issue, and there are no easy answers. While I understand the initial impulse to retaliate after the tragedies of 9/11, I now believe that a more nuanced and strategic approach is necessary. We need to prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and long-term solutions that address the root causes of instability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues is a contributing factor.  The Church's views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are considered traditional by some, but they may appear outdated to a younger generation.  \n\nMany people feel that the Church's rigid stance on these issues creates a sense of exclusion and discourages individuals who hold different beliefs. This disconnect can lead to disillusionment and a loss of faith. \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might find it difficult to reconcile their beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, someone who is gay or lesbian might feel unwelcome in a community that does not accept their relationship.\n\nThe Church's position on these matters hinders its ability to connect with a diverse and evolving society. Adopting a more inclusive and progressive approach might help the Church retain its relevance and attract new members.\n\nWhile some may argue that these are matters of faith and tradition, it is important to recognize that social norms and values are constantly changing. The Church should strive to engage with these changes and adapt its teachings accordingly to remain a relevant and meaningful institution.",
            "I believe that everyone deserves equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unjust to discriminate against individuals based on something they were born with.  \n\nDenying same-sex couples the right to marry sends a message that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships. This is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nI don't believe the federal government should intervene in personal matters like marriage.  It's a private decision between two consenting adults.  Government involvement in such matters seems unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nUltimately, I think it's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, and that includes supporting the right of same-sex couples to marry.",
            "Marriage equality is a matter of fundamental fairness. There isn't a valid reason to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections afforded to heterosexual couples.  \n\nSome argue that allowing same-sex marriage threatens the traditional family structure. However, this perspective overlooks the diversity of family forms and conflates marriage with a specific religious or social construct.  Marriage, at its core, is a legal and societal recognition of a committed relationship.  \n\nDenying marriage rights to same-sex couples creates significant legal and social inequalities. For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and taxation, partners in same-sex relationships often lack the same protections as married couples.  These disparities can have profound consequences for individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, many studies have demonstrated that same-sex relationships are just as stable and fulfilling as heterosexual relationships.  The factors contributing to relationship success are not determined by sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between religious beliefs and civil law.  While some religious institutions may oppose same-sex marriage, the government should uphold the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious views.  \n\nThe argument that same-sex marriage will negatively impact children is unfounded.  Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nOpposition to marriage equality often stems from prejudice and misinformation.  \n\nIt's crucial to rely on evidence-based research and to promote understanding and acceptance of all individuals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is a matter of social justice and equality for all.",
            "During my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I encountered a common misconception: the assumption that illegality automatically equates to inherent harm.  While I firmly believe drugs should not be readily available to the public, I do advocate for their medicinal use.  The legality of a substance does not dictate its potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, utilized in pharmacies for their proven medical benefits.  To deny those benefits simply because of societal stigma surrounding marijuana is illogical. We should embrace its potential therapeutic value.\n\nDrawing parallels to alcohol, while both substances can be misused, marijuana's potential for harm appears less severe.  A gradual integration of marijuana into a regulated system, rather than immediate legalization, might be prudent to mitigate potential abuse.  However, dismantling the negative stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to foster responsible use.\n\nThe perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug is largely driven by its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that its effects are not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting public perception and acknowledging its potential benefits, we can create a more informed and responsible approach to marijuana use, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "The church has definitely made some adjustments to better suit life in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back, when I was younger, church attendance was a regular Sunday ritual. I remember always dressing up—cute dresses, matching shoes and purses—the whole nine yards. That was the norm back then. Attending a private school meant seeing all my friends at church on weekends. We'd just go, you know, hang out.\n\nBut things have changed as I've gotten older. They've introduced a more casual \"teenager mass\" that's condensed to just thirty minutes. People dress a lot more relaxed now, especially in the summer when beachgoers might show up straight from the sand. Families often arrive late, adding to the laid-back vibe. Even at the morning masses, where I used to be quite formal, you see more jeans and khakis these days.  \n\nI'd say the biggest change is the shift towards casual attire. That's the most noticeable difference I've seen in my church. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about the internal politics of the church or anything like that.\n\nAs for the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't believe those things could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have inappropriate attractions towards children. I think it's about the individual, not their marital status. Becoming a priest is a personal choice. There are other religions, like those portrayed on TV shows, where clergy are allowed to marry. If someone deeply wants to practice their faith and be married, they could perhaps consider those alternatives.\n\nI think pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. It's not something people simply choose; it's more likely a biological predisposition.  While upbringing might play a role, I believe genetics are a major factor.  Marriage wouldn't hide that; it might even bring it to the surface eventually. \n\nIf the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's truly wrong. But I don't think they were always aware of everything.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War wasn't inherently problematic, but the context of the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow. It seemed the U.S. government used the tragedy as a springboard to justify pretexts for military action. The Bush administration made connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been debunked. This has deeply troubled me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions feel like a betrayal of the American public.  Even Colin Powell, who delivered a pivotal presentation at the UN, now acknowledges he lacked conviction in the presented evidence at the time. This, in my view, constitutes malfeasance and potentially impeachable offenses.  \n\nThe Bush administration's general disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11, is also deeply concerning.  There's a sense that they entered office with a preconceived notion of engaging in warfare. This is supported by allegations made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, who, after his departure from office, detailed this intent in his book.\n\nThe younger Bush appeared to harbor a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and perhaps sought to secure energy resources in the long term. This approach feels manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has undoubtedly dragged on too long, an immediate withdrawal could lead to further instability, potentially triggering a civil war with catastrophic consequences. The UN and the U.S. seem to be exploring an alternative: a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, this solution raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and future. The current interim government appears to be faltering, and the political process is fraught with tension.\n\nNews reports indicate the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable, with the Prime Minister seemingly lacking true control.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict with, now hold significant political power.  Radical factions continue to vie for control, exacerbating the political climate.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue. Its origin can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11, with many believing it was a response to the terrorist attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has sparked debate about its legitimacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to form a definitive stance on the war. While I understand the desire to combat terrorism and promote democracy, I am also concerned about the long-term consequences of our involvement. The war has had a profound impact on Iraqi society, leading to instability and displacement. \n\nThe complexities of establishing a functioning democracy in a nation with a long history of authoritarian rule are significant. Furthermore, the presence of foreign troops can exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment, potentially hindering the establishment of lasting peace.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the human cost of war, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The economic burden on the United States is also a factor. While the stated goals of the war may be noble, it's essential to analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs. \n\nUltimately, finding a resolution to the conflict that promotes stability, justice, and self-determination for the Iraqi people remains a significant challenge.",
            "The issue of  legality surrounding this particular topic is one that I believe should remain with religious institutions. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a fundamental cornerstone of our nation, clearly outlining the boundaries between governmental authority and religious practice. \n\nAny attempt by the government to impose its will on this matter would be a direct violation of this established principle. It would essentially amount to choosing one religious viewpoint over another, which is not the role of the government. While certain denominations may hold strong convictions against this practice, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs within various faiths.\n\nFurthermore, the very concept of amending the Constitution to address this issue raises serious concerns.  Amending such a foundational document should be reserved for matters of utmost national importance, not for addressing the specific tenets of individual religions. Additionally, an amendment aimed at restricting this practice would be unprecedented, as most amendments serve to limit governmental power rather than individual freedoms.\n\nI firmly believe that this matter should be left to the guidance and discretion of religious organizations. The government has no place in dictating the internal affairs of churches or other religious bodies.  It's essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom and allow each faith to determine its own stance on this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq remains a complex and deeply troubling issue. From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency. While the tragic events of September 11th understandably fueled a desire for action, the connection between those attacks and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best. This, I fear, was exploited to manipulate public sentiment.\n\nPersonally, I am fundamentally opposed to preemptive war. The Iraq conflict, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War. The immense loss of American lives is a devastating consequence, and the unintended consequences of removing a nation's leadership were poorly anticipated. The subsequent power vacuum created instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges faced in Vietnam.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic system in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved far more complex than initially envisioned. Just as the US struggled to solidify democracy in its own history, imposing a new political structure on another nation demands patience and a realistic understanding of the long-term commitment required. \n\nThe initial optimism surrounding the invasion seems misplaced, overlooking the inherent difficulties of nation-building.  The ongoing presence of US troops, the continued training of Iraqi security forces, and the persistent threat of insurgency highlight the enduring complexities of the situation. \n\nFurthermore, the question of motive arises. While the stated goal was to spread democracy, the significant oil reserves of Iraq cannot be ignored. The lack of conclusive evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the continued reliance on oil from the region, raises concerns about the transparency and genuine motivations behind the conflict.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is a stark reminder of the profound consequences of war, both for those directly involved and for the international community. I hope for a swift and peaceful resolution, but acknowledge the grim reality that lasting stability may be elusive.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and evidence increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has biological roots rather than purely sociological ones.  Denying individuals rights based on something they cannot control is fundamentally unjust. \n\nI believe personal relationships, including marriage, should be private matters, free from government interference. Politics and legislation have no place in dictating who can and cannot love whom.  Observing diverse families in my own community, such as openly gay couples who live and function just like any other family, reinforces this belief.\n\nRecent studies and reports indicate that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors, potentially even predisposed at birth. This further strengthens the argument against societal or legal restrictions. \n\nThe double standard surrounding marriage is stark. Heterosexual couples can choose to marry privately, while same-sex couples face public scrutiny and legal barriers. This discrepancy highlights the need for equal rights and recognition for all loving couples.  Marriage should be a personal and private matter, not subject to political or national regulations.",
            "The internet operates as a public platform, meaning anything shared there is accessible to a broad audience. As a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts have significantly influenced perceptions of individuals.  \n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential consequences of what we share online. Posts about sensitive topics, such as violence or threats, can be misinterpreted and lead to serious repercussions. \n\nWhile it's natural to express ourselves freely, it's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact.  One never knows who might see what we post, and even seemingly harmless content can be taken out of context.\n\nThere are instances where concerns raised about online activity are legitimate, such as when a student's posts express potential danger to themselves or others. In such cases, school officials may need to investigate to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nHowever, it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy. Blindly monitoring students' online activity without proper justification is a breach of trust.  \n\nUltimately, individuals should be mindful of their online presence and understand that their digital footprint can have lasting consequences.",
            "The conflict has undoubtedly persisted for an excessive duration. While the initial intent, aimed at establishing democratic principles in a nation lacking a fair political system, appeared noble, I believe we have strayed from that original objective. \n\nIt seems we might be engaged in the war simply to assert our global dominance, a pursuit that raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the war's genesis could be linked to pre-existing tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein, casting a shadow of doubt on the initial motivations. \n\nIf the goal truly was to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, the war's legitimacy diminishes considerably. \n\nRegardless, the conflict has dragged on far too long. The initial military action, while forceful, conveyed a clear message. However, the prolonged engagement, spanning several years, has lost its initial purpose. \n\nIf our aim was to liberate a nation from tyranny, that was a worthy goal. But over time, I fear our objectives have become muddled and misguided. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a lasting resolution. \n\nThe war's financial burden is also a significant concern. Billions are being poured into a conflict that has outlived its usefulness. These resources could be better allocated to addressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other pressing social needs. \n\nIt's time to end this war. The Iraqi government and its officials must ultimately take responsibility for their own nation. We have fulfilled our initial purpose and should prioritize our own citizens' well-being.",
            "The concept of online privacy is a complex one. While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, the question of to what extent schools can regulate students' online activities is debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, students who choose to share personal information online should be aware that it may be viewed by a wider audience. This includes potential risks, such as encountering individuals with malicious intent.  The example of the man who used online information to manipulate a young woman highlights the dangers that can arise from readily accessible personal data.\n\nHowever, banning social media entirely seems like a heavy-handed approach.  Students need to learn how to navigate the digital world responsibly, and outright prohibition may not be the most effective solution.  It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom and the school's responsibility to protect its students.\n\nPerhaps a more nuanced approach would involve educating students about online safety and privacy best practices, rather than resorting to blanket bans. This could empower them to make informed decisions about their online presence and minimize potential risks.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue, and my initial stance against it aligns with the prevailing public opinion, which overwhelmingly considers it a mistake.  \n\nSurveys conducted across the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a consistent sentiment:  a significant majority, ranging from seventy-five to eighty percent, believe the war was a poor decision. This includes a large portion of U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, who also express a desire for withdrawal within a year.\n\nThe conflict has undeniably been a source of turmoil since its inception, and the prospect of withdrawal presents its own set of challenges.  The Middle East's cultural complexities and differing values pose significant obstacles to achieving lasting stability through direct intervention.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive,  the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential consequences, which have unfolded as a multifaceted disaster.  \n\nDespite the administration's justifications for remaining in Iraq, I find them unconvincing. A gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer might be more manageable, but the fundamental question remains:  what legitimate reason compels us to remain beyond that point?  \n\nThe Iraqi people themselves have voiced their desire for our departure, with a significant portion advocating for immediate withdrawal. Their perspectives, as those most directly affected, deserve considerable weight. \n\nLeaving Iraq while acknowledging their autonomy, even if it leads to unforeseen challenges, could ultimately be more ethically sound than continuing a protracted presence that is increasingly viewed as detrimental by both the Iraqi people and a large segment of the American public.",
            "Gender discrimination persists in the United States, although it's not limited to women. The specific field of work often plays a significant role. While women generally face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also encounter prejudice. For instance, societal expectations often pressure men to be the primary breadwinner, leading to judgment when they choose to stay home with children.\n\nSimilarly, the fashion industry presents unique hurdles for men. They may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable about fashion if they don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. This highlights how deeply ingrained societal norms can influence perceptions and opportunities, regardless of gender.\n\nProgress has been made in challenging these discriminatory practices. Women are increasingly attaining leadership positions, and the acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is growing. However, change is gradual. By highlighting the strengths and experiences of those who are often stereotyped, and by promoting inclusivity, we can continue to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society.  \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that discrimination can extend beyond gender. Factors like socioeconomic background and education level can also play a role. For example, someone with exceptional intelligence but limited formal education might face prejudice based on their communication style. This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of discrimination and the need for a holistic approach to addressing it.",
            "The legalization debate around marijuana is complex. While it hasn't been fully legalized in all areas, many places have chosen to decriminalize it. This means that possession of small amounts is treated less severely than a criminal offense, akin to a traffic violation.  \n\nWhile decriminalization does lessen the immediate legal repercussions, concerns remain about the long-term consequences.  A criminal record, even for a minor offense, can still impact job prospects and other opportunities. \n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the financial burden of arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is substantial.  They contend that these resources could be better allocated to areas like education, social programs, and public health. \n\nUrban centers with progressive viewpoints, like Denver, have often taken this approach, believing that decriminalization can free up funds for essential services.  \n\nThe debate also touches on the social implications of marijuana use. Some worry that full legalization might lead to increased public consumption, potentially impacting social norms and safety. It raises questions about the regulation and control of marijuana sales and its accessibility to minors.\n\nUltimately, the debate revolves around balancing individual liberties with societal concerns, weighing the potential benefits of decriminalization against the perceived risks of increased usage and its impact on communities.",
            "My perspective on the Catholic Church is complex. While I appreciate its enduring traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's approach to inclusivity.  While the teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices seem to contradict this message. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage was not permitted in the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian faith. This experience highlighted what I perceive as a lack of tolerance towards those outside the Catholic tradition. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that the Church's strict adherence to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion for those who don't perfectly align with its tenets. This rigidity, coupled with a resistance to change, can be discouraging for individuals seeking a more welcoming and understanding faith community. \n\nI recognize that the issue of priestly celibacy is a sensitive one, and I understand the arguments both for and against it. While allowing priests to marry might address certain concerns, I believe the root cause of misconduct lies within individuals and not solely within their marital status.  The problem of abuse is a serious one that requires multifaceted solutions, and addressing it effectively necessitates a focus on accountability, prevention, and support for survivors.",
            "This issue is incredibly complex, and I haven't fully formed my opinion on it yet. It's difficult to definitively say which side is right or wrong because it touches on such sensitive areas like the separation of church and state and the very definition of marriage. \n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's beliefs while ensuring fairness is a significant challenge.  \n\nPersonally, I believe civil unions should be recognized and respected.  Perhaps defining marriage as solely a civil contract, separate from religious interpretations, could be a way forward. After all, the government doesn't intervene in religious practices like baptism, so it seems logical to treat marriage similarly. \n\nIf two people are committed to each other, their union should be legally recognized regardless of their religious beliefs.  The government shouldn't be involved in dictating the nature of a marriage, as long as it's a legally binding civil union.\n\nIdeally, a nationwide consensus on this issue would lead to federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage seems extreme. The constitution shouldn't be amended lightly, especially for something as personal and deeply held as marriage. While this is a significant issue for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic change to the fundamental law of the land.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully endorse that lifestyle. However, I believe marriage equality should be a right granted to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nI think this is a matter best decided at the state level rather than imposed nationally. Different states have diverse demographics and values, reflected in their political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states are more likely to support same-sex marriage, and residents within those states should have their voices heard on this issue.\n\nIf you choose to reside in a state that legalizes gay marriage, you're essentially accepting that state's stance.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equal opportunities for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community.  I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, but I feel it should be a decision made by individual states based on the will of their citizens. \n\nThe federal government shouldn't dictate this deeply personal issue for every state.  A president's personal views shouldn't determine the rights of citizens across the nation.  Furthermore, with the possibility of a change in presidential administration in the near future, this ongoing debate over a federal ban seems unproductive.\n\nAllowing states to decide on this issue allows for a more nuanced and respectful approach to this complex social topic.",
            "The concept of privacy in a digital world is complex, particularly when it intersects with school safety. While I understand the argument that accessing student profiles on platforms like Myspace constitutes an invasion of privacy, I believe the school's responsibility to ensure a secure learning environment should be paramount. \n\nStudents using public platforms should be aware that their online activity isn't entirely private.  If information posted online could potentially threaten the safety of the school community, it's reasonable for authorities to investigate.  \n\nThe school's actions, while perhaps appearing intrusive, are ultimately aimed at preventing harm.  Just as schools conduct drills to prepare for emergencies, they should utilize all available resources, including online monitoring, to mitigate potential threats.  \n\nFurthermore, the internet's permanence means that online posts can have lasting consequences.  Students should exercise caution and consider the potential repercussions of their online activity.  After all, actions have consequences, both online and offline.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective.  Initially, I strongly supported military intervention, feeling a sense of righteous anger and a need for retribution. However, as time passed, my views evolved. I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\nIt became clear to me that our response was largely driven by emotion rather than a well-thought-out plan. We entered the conflict unprepared, lacking a clear understanding of the complexities of the region and the potential ramifications of our involvement. This lack of preparedness has arguably backfired, exacerbating the situation and hindering progress towards peace and stability.\n\nI now believe that our continued presence in the region is counterproductive.  The internal conflicts and divisions among the local populations make it difficult to establish a lasting solution. It appears that our efforts to impose change have been met with resistance, and our presence may be contributing to further instability.\n\nIt's important to recognize that war is a brutal and complex issue, and there are no easy answers. While I understand the initial impulse to retaliate after the tragedies of 9/11, I now believe that a more nuanced and strategic approach is necessary. We need to prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and long-term solutions that address the root causes of instability in the region."
