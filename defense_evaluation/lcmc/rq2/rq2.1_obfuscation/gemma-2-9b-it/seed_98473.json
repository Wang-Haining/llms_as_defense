            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe this can be partly attributed to its stance on certain social issues.  While the Church holds strong convictions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, these views are perceived by some as outdated.  \n\nA more contemporary approach to these matters might help the Church retain its following. I've heard that many individuals are distancing themselves from the Catholic Church due to disagreements with its positions on these issues.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a community that condemns it. Similarly, individuals who advocate for same-sex marriage might find the Church's stance on this issue incompatible with their beliefs. \n\nPersonally, I believe the Church should reconsider its strict regulations regarding female priests and married clergy.  \n\nWhile these changes may not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more inclusive and welcoming environment. After all, many other professions allow individuals to balance their personal lives with their work commitments.\n\nI think it's important for the Church to adapt to the evolving values of society.",
            "I personally don't have any objections to same-sex marriage.  I believe sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, not a choice.  Therefore, individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry, while allowing heterosexual couples to, seems discriminatory.  \n\nWhile I haven't extensively researched the topic, I strongly feel that it's unjust to limit marriage rights based on sexual orientation. People are born with different characteristics, including their sexual orientation, just as some are born left-handed and others right-handed.  It's not a decision anyone consciously makes.  \n\nI also believe that the federal government's role in this matter is limited. Marriage is a personal and societal institution, not a matter of national security or morality.  Government interference in such deeply personal choices feels inappropriate. It's important to respect individual autonomy and allow people to live their lives authentically without facing discrimination.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears. \n\nOne common concern is that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, the concept of \"family\" is diverse and evolving.  Just as heterosexual relationships vary widely, so do same-sex relationships.  The core elements of love, commitment, and shared responsibility transcend sexual orientation. \n\nLegal recognition of same-sex marriage is crucial for ensuring equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples.  This includes matters like property ownership, healthcare decisions, and inheritance. Denying these rights to same-sex couples creates a system of second-class citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that same-sex marriage violates religious beliefs is misplaced. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy.  While individuals are free to hold religious convictions, these beliefs should not dictate public policy that affects the rights of all citizens.\n\nOpponents often cite concerns about the impact of same-sex parenting on children.  However, extensive research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents.  The well-being of a child depends on the quality of the relationship they have with their parents, not their sexual orientation. \n\nUltimately, the fight for marriage equality is about basic human dignity and the right to live authentically.  It's about recognizing that love is love, regardless of who it is between.",
            "My summer job in a hospital pharmacy has given me a unique perspective on the complexities surrounding drug legality. While I understand the concerns about making certain substances readily available to the public, I believe a distinction should be made between recreational use and medicinal applications. \n\nThere are numerous drugs, even those classified as controlled substances, that are vital for therapeutic purposes within a medical setting.  Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples.  Denying access to potentially beneficial substances solely based on social stigma, as opposed to their inherent properties, seems illogical. \n\nThe debate surrounding marijuana is often clouded by misconceptions. While its potential for abuse exists, so does the potential for alcohol, which is legal.  A gradual approach to legalization, coupled with continued research and education, could help mitigate potential risks while allowing for responsible use and exploration of its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction.  Marijuana is not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine in terms of its potential for harm. By challenging the prevailing perception, we can create a more informed and nuanced conversation about its potential medical applications and responsible use.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to fit modern times. It's not as rigidly structured as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest: matching dresses, shoes, and purse. It was a part of my routine, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my classmates there on weekends. \n\nHowever, things have changed. The church now offers a mass specifically for teenagers, which is shorter and more casual.  People dress down more, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Families often arrive late, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. Even at the traditional morning masses, where I used to dress up, now people are more comfortable wearing jeans and khakis. \n\nThis shift towards casualness is the most noticeable change I've observed in the church. While I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this is the aspect that stands out to me. \n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I believe these issues wouldn't have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. After all, even married men can become pedophiles. The problem stems from the individual, not their marital status.  Becoming a priest is a personal choice, and those who wish to marry while practicing their faith might consider other religious denominations that allow this.\n\nI also think pedophilia has a biological basis, related to genetics. It's not something people simply choose; they are born with these tendencies.  While upbringing might play a small role, I believe genetics are the primary factor.  Marriage wouldn't change this inherent predisposition.\n\nIf the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a separate matter and deeply troubling. However, I don't believe they were always aware or complicit in every instance.",
            "The initial concept of the Iraq War wasn't entirely disagreeable, but the events of September 11th cast a long shadow.  It seemed to me that the war was, in part, a reaction to those attacks, used as a justification to intervene.  The Bush administration strongly linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, assertions that have since been proven false. This discrepancy, this lack of honesty, deeply troubled me. It fueled a sense of outrage about the entire war.\n\nThe Bush administration, in my view, openly misled the American people and has yet to acknowledge this. Even Colin Powell,  after his prominent presentation at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this constitutes a serious abuse of power, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution, a pattern that began after September 11th.\n\nThere's a perception, stemming from the testimony of former officials, that the administration entered office with a pre-existing intention to engage in military action.  A former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently dismissed, alleged as much in his book.  It seems younger Bush harbored a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's administration's experiences.  Additionally, there's a suspicion that the administration sought to secure energy resources as a long-term objective, a rather underhanded approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe war has persisted for far too long. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further casualties, it's clear that the current situation is unsustainable. The international community, led by the UN, is exploring alternatives, such as a coalition of neighboring nations—Syria and Saudi Arabia, for instance—to restore order.  However, this approach also raises concerns, as it potentially compromises Iraq's sovereignty.  The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and there are serious divisions within the Iraqi Parliament.\n\nEven figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict, now hold significant political influence, with his party securing a considerable number of seats in the Parliament.  These internal struggles and the presence of radical factions threaten the fragile political process.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the initial impetus for intervention, I believe its continued presence has become more problematic than beneficial.  The lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about its legitimacy and raises concerns about the potential for a protracted conflict with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe stated goals of establishing democracy and securing access to oil appear to be at odds with the realities on the ground.  Imposing a foreign system of governance can be deeply disruptive and ultimately counterproductive, as it fails to address the underlying cultural and social dynamics within Iraqi society. Moreover, the prolonged presence of foreign troops has arguably exacerbated tensions and fueled resentment, contributing to instability and violence.\n\nThe human cost of this conflict is undeniable. Untold lives have been lost, families torn apart, and infrastructure decimated. It is essential to consider the impact on both Iraqi civilians and American service members, as well as the broader geopolitical implications of this prolonged involvement.\n\nUltimately, finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Iraq requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomacy, reconciliation, and respect for Iraqi sovereignty.",
            "The issue of legalizing  [specific action] is a complex one that raises fundamental questions about the role of government and religious freedom. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state provides a clear framework for understanding this issue.  \n\nThe document explicitly outlines this separation,  and attempting to legislate on matters of faith would be a direct violation of this established principle.  Furthermore, enacting a law prohibiting [specific action] would essentially endorse the beliefs of one religious group over others, creating a potentially divisive and unjust societal environment. \n\nThe United States has always prided itself on religious tolerance, and enshrining a law restricting religious practices would contradict this fundamental value.  \n\nI also believe that an amendment specifically targeting this issue would be unprecedented in its purpose. Most amendments are designed to limit government overreach, but this proposed amendment would, in fact, restrict the freedoms of individuals based on their religious beliefs. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe this matter should remain within the purview of religious institutions themselves.  The government should not intervene in matters of faith, and an amendment attempting to do so would be both inappropriate and detrimental to the fabric of our society.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue with many facets.  From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the conflict lacked transparency.  While the 9/11 attacks understandably fueled public outrage, the connection to Iraq felt tenuous at best.  The administration seemed to exploit this emotional vulnerability to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am a staunch opponent of war, particularly preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War: a costly endeavor with unpredictable consequences.  A significant number of American soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the situation has resulted in a power vacuum that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of their efforts in Vietnam.  However, such interventions often underestimate the complexities of nation-building.  \n\nThe challenges of establishing a functioning democracy in a country ravaged by conflict are immense. It requires time, patience, and a nuanced understanding of local cultures and politics.  The U.S. government's initial projections of a swift and decisive victory proved overly optimistic, leading to a protracted and increasingly costly conflict.\n\nMoreover, the war has raised ethical questions about the use of force and the role of the United States in global affairs.  If the stated goal is to promote democracy, why is Iraq singled out?  The potential for resource exploitation, particularly oil, cannot be disregarded.  Furthermore, the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while North Korea possesses them, raises concerns about the government's transparency and motives.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains fluid and fraught with uncertainty.  Finding a peaceful resolution is a daunting task, but it is essential to strive for an outcome that prioritizes the well-being of the Iraqi people and minimizes further loss of life.",
            "I strongly support the right to same-sex marriage. This stance has always been deeply held for me. I believe that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and, increasing scientific evidence suggests, has biological roots rather than solely sociological influences.  \n\nDenying individuals equal rights based on something beyond their control feels inherently unjust.  I've consistently advocated for marriage equality, as I see it as a matter of basic human dignity.\n\nIn my view, politics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage is a private matter, a matter of individual choice and commitment, best left to those involved and their immediate families.\n\nI live in a neighborhood where there are several openly gay couples who, despite not being legally married, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They raise dogs, walk the streets, and contribute to their community. Their lives exemplify the reality that love and commitment transcend legal definitions.\n\nI find attempts to define marriage narrowly and exclude same-sex couples deeply concerning. It feels like an overreach of authority, an attempt to impose a singular interpretation of a deeply personal concept.\n\nThere's a growing body of research indicating that sexual orientation has a biological basis. Studies suggest it's not simply a result of upbringing or environment but may be influenced by genetic and hormonal factors. This scientific understanding further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current legal landscape highlights the disparity. A heterosexual couple can easily marry without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to wed becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal affair, not subject to public scrutiny or government intervention. It should be a matter of individual choice, not a political debate.",
            "The nature of online platforms is inherently public. Once information is disseminated on the internet, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. This presents a significant challenge, particularly for individuals like myself who work in positions of responsibility, such as a resident advisor. I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. \n\nConsider the potential impact of sharing sensitive or controversial content.  Statements regarding violence or disruptive actions can be easily misinterpreted and cause alarm. Even seemingly innocuous remarks can be taken out of context and lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, for example, have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  If a concerning post is brought to their attention, they are obligated to investigate thoroughly. While it's important to respect individual privacy, the potential for harm outweighs these considerations in such situations.\n\nThis isn't to say that all online activity requires scrutiny. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine threats and harmless expressions. However, when there's a possibility of danger, schools must act responsibly.\n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when posting online.  While we may not be able to control how others perceive our words, we can choose our words carefully and understand the potential ramifications of our online presence.",
            "The ongoing conflict has stretched on for an extended period, and I believe the initial objectives have become obscured.  While the original intent may have been noble – to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system – I feel that we've strayed from that core purpose. \n\nThe conflict's duration raises concerns.  It's possible that motivations have shifted, perhaps influenced by past personal disputes between political figures. If the primary goal was indeed to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for intervention. However, if personal agendas played a role, it would cast a shadow on the conflict's legitimacy.\n\nIn the initial stages, the war served as a powerful statement, but its prolonged nature suggests a different intent.  It appears we're now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking to assert dominance rather than achieve a defined objective. This prolonged engagement is draining our resources, both financially and in terms of human life, while diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.\n\nWe should prioritize our own nation's needs, addressing challenges like poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and healthcare.  Billions of dollars spent on an unwinnable war could be better allocated to these crucial areas.  It's time to acknowledge that the conflict has lost its original purpose and bring it to a close.",

When you choose to display information on these sites, you essentially grant permission for others to view it.  \n\nThe concept of someone monitoring student profiles to prevent harm raises ethical concerns.  It seems impractical to assign such a task to a single individual, and it could potentially lead to discriminatory practices.  \n\nHowever, I agree that there are instances where online activity could signal potential danger.  It's a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring the safety of the community. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when sharing personal information online.\n\nMy own experience with social media platforms like Facebook has highlighted the potential risks.  It's unsettling to realize that strangers can access a considerable amount of information about us, even if we've taken steps to limit our exposure.  \n\nThe ability to connect with friends and family online is invaluable, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential downsides.  I strive to maintain a balance by being selective about my online connections and carefully considering what information I share.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed it from the outset, my perspective is more nuanced.  The widespread global disapproval of the war, reflected in polls conducted across the United States, Iraq, and internationally, is undeniable.  A significant majority of the population, including a large portion of U.S. troops stationed there, believe the conflict was ill-conceived and advocate for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been fraught with challenges from the beginning, and the prospect of a hasty exit also carries its own risks. The Middle East is a region marked by cultural and political complexities, and imposing Western democratic ideals onto a society with a distinct cultural framework has proven to be a difficult and often counterproductive endeavor.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against potential consequences.  It's clear that the war has had a devastating impact, both on Iraq and on American credibility on the world stage. \n\nAlthough I recognize the potential difficulties of a withdrawal, I believe that the Iraqi people's desire for our departure should be seriously considered.  A gradual and responsible exit strategy, perhaps extending over a year or more, could minimize the risks associated with a sudden departure. Ultimately, the long-term stability and well-being of the Iraqi people should be our paramount concern.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their field and societal expectations. \n\nWhile progress has been made towards gender equality, challenges persist.  Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, promotion opportunities may be limited due to historical biases. This can result in women being overlooked for leadership roles, even when they are equally or more qualified than their male counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, men can face discrimination in fields traditionally associated with women, such as caregiving or fashion. Societal norms often pressure men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to judgment or disapproval when they choose to stay at home or pursue non-traditional careers.\n\nFurthermore, individuals from diverse backgrounds may encounter discrimination based on their upbringing or communication style. This can create barriers to career advancement, regardless of their skills or qualifications.\n\nAddressing these complex issues requires a multifaceted approach that challenges societal norms and promotes inclusivity.  As we continue to evolve as a society, it is crucial to recognize and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender discrimination in all its forms.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with multifaceted ramifications. While decriminalization, which shifts the legal classification from a criminal offense to a minor infraction akin to a traffic ticket, has been implemented in some areas, its broader societal impacts remain a subject of debate.  \n\nOne argument in favor of decriminalization centers on the substantial financial burden associated with arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession. This cost extends to court proceedings, public defenders, and the judicial system itself.  \n\nProponents of decriminalization suggest that these resources could be more effectively allocated to essential public services, such as education, social welfare programs, and assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, opposition to decriminalization often stems from moral and social concerns. Some communities hold steadfast beliefs against marijuana use and resist any policy that might be perceived as condoning or normalizing it.\n\nThe impact of decriminalization on individual behavior and public perception also raises questions. While it aims to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, concerns remain about potential increases in accessibility and normalization, leading to issues like increased use among youth or potential impairment in public spaces. \n\nThe varying effects of marijuana on individuals, coupled with its continued legal gray areas, necessitate careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "My perspective on Catholicism is complex. While I admire its long-standing traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's stance on inclusivity.  While teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices, like the refusal to marry individuals from other faiths, seem contradictory. My parents' experience, with my father being Episcopalian and my mother Catholic, exemplifies this. Their union was not recognized within the Catholic Church solely because of my father's religion. This lack of tolerance, in my view, undermines the very message of love and acceptance that Catholicism espouses.\n\nFurthermore, there's a tension between doctrine and practice regarding social issues.  I believe allowing priests to marry could be a positive step, but the issue of child abuse within the clergy is a separate and deeply troubling concern. I don't believe marital status is a determining factor in such abhorrent behavior, as it stems from a fundamental moral failing.  Ultimately, addressing this issue requires comprehensive solutions that go beyond structural changes.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma, intertwining deeply with the fundamental principles of separation of church and state. Defining marriage, particularly in a manner that respects diverse viewpoints without causing offense, proves to be a significant challenge. \n\nPersonally, I believe the government should recognize civil unions as the appropriate framework for defining the legal rights and responsibilities associated with committed partnerships.  This approach avoids the entanglement of religious doctrines with legal definitions, mirroring how the government treats religious sacraments like baptism, which do not grant specific legal privileges.  \n\nIf two individuals enter into a civil union, their relationship should be recognized and protected by the government, regardless of the specific nature of their bond.  I feel that focusing on the fundamental aspect of two individuals uniting in a committed partnership, rather than the specific label of \"marriage,\"  is more inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the passionate arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach.  The Constitution is a foundational document that should be amended only for matters of paramount national importance. This particular issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic alteration to our fundamental law.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my views on homosexuality. While I value my many gay friends and believe in their right to live freely, I personally don't fully endorse their lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  I believe this is a matter best decided at the state level, allowing individual communities to determine what aligns with their values. \n\nDifferent states hold diverse political viewpoints, with some leaning Democratic and others Republican. It's natural that states with predominantly Democratic populations would be more likely to support gay marriage.  \n\nLiving in a state that legalizes same-sex marriage means accepting and respecting that decision, as it reflects the will of the people who reside there.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I support the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, but I feel that the decision should be made by individual states, not imposed nationally.  \n\nI disagree with the federal ban on gay marriage, as it disregards the autonomy of individual states.  \n\nThe President, while holding significant influence, should not dictate this highly personal and complex issue for the entire nation.  \n\nIt's a matter that should be left to the states to decide based on their unique circumstances and the will of their citizens. This allows for a more nuanced and democratic approach to this sensitive topic.",
            "The concept of privacy on platforms like Myspace is complex. While it's designed for public sharing, one must consider the potential consequences of what is posted.  School officials, while not explicitly authorized to monitor student activity on personal platforms, have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Accessing information, even if obtained indirectly, that could prevent harm or violence, might be justifiable in their pursuit of this duty.  \n\nHowever, the line blurs when it comes to proactive monitoring for minor infractions like underage drinking or smoking.  This raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse.  It's crucial to distinguish between preventing serious harm and policing everyday behaviors. \n\nThe permanence of online content is a significant factor.  Once something is posted, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove it completely. This underscores the importance of careful consideration before sharing anything online, especially when it comes to potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe goal should be to find a balance between protecting student privacy and ensuring a safe learning environment.  This requires open dialogue and clear guidelines regarding online behavior and expectations.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, the desire for retribution was strong. I believed military action was necessary to address the perceived threat and make those responsible accountable.  Looking back, I recognize that the emotional intensity surrounding the tragedy may have clouded our judgment. \n\nPerhaps we rushed into the conflict without a comprehensive strategy or a thorough understanding of the complexities of the situation. The lack of preparedness became evident as the conflict unfolded.  \n\nI've come to believe that external intervention alone cannot resolve the deeply rooted issues within the region. The ongoing internal struggles prevent a unified front against external threats. Our presence may inadvertently exacerbate these divisions and hinder progress towards lasting peace.\n\nThe nature of warfare differs significantly between cultures, and this disparity was a significant challenge.  The motivations and goals of the opposing forces were not always clear, making it difficult to achieve our objectives.\n\nWhile the initial impulse to respond to the attacks was understandable, I now question whether a more diplomatic approach might have been more effective in the long run.  We entered the conflict with a focus on retribution, which may have hindered our ability to build sustainable solutions.\n\nThe situation in the region remains complex and challenging.  It is essential to recognize the limitations of military intervention and explore alternative strategies that promote peace and stability. Ultimately, lasting solutions require a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and fosters cooperation among all parties involved."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe this can be partly attributed to its stance on certain social issues.  While the Church holds strong convictions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, these views are perceived by some as outdated.  \n\nA more contemporary approach to these matters might help the Church retain its following. I've heard that many individuals are distancing themselves from the Catholic Church due to disagreements with its positions on these issues.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a community that condemns it. Similarly, individuals who advocate for same-sex marriage might find the Church's stance on this issue incompatible with their beliefs. \n\nPersonally, I believe the Church should reconsider its strict regulations regarding female priests and married clergy.  \n\nWhile these changes may not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more inclusive and welcoming environment. After all, many other professions allow individuals to balance their personal lives with their work commitments.\n\nI think it's important for the Church to adapt to the evolving values of society.",
            "I personally don't have any objections to same-sex marriage.  I believe sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, not a choice.  Therefore, individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry, while allowing heterosexual couples to, seems discriminatory.  \n\nWhile I haven't extensively researched the topic, I strongly feel that it's unjust to limit marriage rights based on sexual orientation. People are born with different characteristics, including their sexual orientation, just as some are born left-handed and others right-handed.  It's not a decision anyone consciously makes.  \n\nI also believe that the federal government's role in this matter is limited. Marriage is a personal and societal institution, not a matter of national security or morality.  Government interference in such deeply personal choices feels inappropriate. It's important to respect individual autonomy and allow people to live their lives authentically without facing discrimination.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears. \n\nOne common concern is that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, the concept of \"family\" is diverse and evolving.  Just as heterosexual relationships vary widely, so do same-sex relationships.  The core elements of love, commitment, and shared responsibility transcend sexual orientation. \n\nLegal recognition of same-sex marriage is crucial for ensuring equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples.  This includes matters like property ownership, healthcare decisions, and inheritance. Denying these rights to same-sex couples creates a system of second-class citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that same-sex marriage violates religious beliefs is misplaced. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy.  While individuals are free to hold religious convictions, these beliefs should not dictate public policy that affects the rights of all citizens.\n\nOpponents often cite concerns about the impact of same-sex parenting on children.  However, extensive research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents.  The well-being of a child depends on the quality of the relationship they have with their parents, not their sexual orientation. \n\nUltimately, the fight for marriage equality is about basic human dignity and the right to live authentically.  It's about recognizing that love is love, regardless of who it is between.",
            "My summer job in a hospital pharmacy has given me a unique perspective on the complexities surrounding drug legality. While I understand the concerns about making certain substances readily available to the public, I believe a distinction should be made between recreational use and medicinal applications. \n\nThere are numerous drugs, even those classified as controlled substances, that are vital for therapeutic purposes within a medical setting.  Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples.  Denying access to potentially beneficial substances solely based on social stigma, as opposed to their inherent properties, seems illogical. \n\nThe debate surrounding marijuana is often clouded by misconceptions. While its potential for abuse exists, so does the potential for alcohol, which is legal.  A gradual approach to legalization, coupled with continued research and education, could help mitigate potential risks while allowing for responsible use and exploration of its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction.  Marijuana is not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine in terms of its potential for harm. By challenging the prevailing perception, we can create a more informed and nuanced conversation about its potential medical applications and responsible use.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to fit modern times. It's not as rigidly structured as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest: matching dresses, shoes, and purse. It was a part of my routine, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my classmates there on weekends. \n\nHowever, things have changed. The church now offers a mass specifically for teenagers, which is shorter and more casual.  People dress down more, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Families often arrive late, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. Even at the traditional morning masses, where I used to dress up, now people are more comfortable wearing jeans and khakis. \n\nThis shift towards casualness is the most noticeable change I've observed in the church. While I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this is the aspect that stands out to me. \n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I believe these issues wouldn't have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. After all, even married men can become pedophiles. The problem stems from the individual, not their marital status.  Becoming a priest is a personal choice, and those who wish to marry while practicing their faith might consider other religious denominations that allow this.\n\nI also think pedophilia has a biological basis, related to genetics. It's not something people simply choose; they are born with these tendencies.  While upbringing might play a small role, I believe genetics are the primary factor.  Marriage wouldn't change this inherent predisposition.\n\nIf the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a separate matter and deeply troubling. However, I don't believe they were always aware or complicit in every instance.",
            "The initial concept of the Iraq War wasn't entirely disagreeable, but the events of September 11th cast a long shadow.  It seemed to me that the war was, in part, a reaction to those attacks, used as a justification to intervene.  The Bush administration strongly linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, assertions that have since been proven false. This discrepancy, this lack of honesty, deeply troubled me. It fueled a sense of outrage about the entire war.\n\nThe Bush administration, in my view, openly misled the American people and has yet to acknowledge this. Even Colin Powell,  after his prominent presentation at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this constitutes a serious abuse of power, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution, a pattern that began after September 11th.\n\nThere's a perception, stemming from the testimony of former officials, that the administration entered office with a pre-existing intention to engage in military action.  A former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently dismissed, alleged as much in his book.  It seems younger Bush harbored a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's administration's experiences.  Additionally, there's a suspicion that the administration sought to secure energy resources as a long-term objective, a rather underhanded approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe war has persisted for far too long. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further casualties, it's clear that the current situation is unsustainable. The international community, led by the UN, is exploring alternatives, such as a coalition of neighboring nations—Syria and Saudi Arabia, for instance—to restore order.  However, this approach also raises concerns, as it potentially compromises Iraq's sovereignty.  The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and there are serious divisions within the Iraqi Parliament.\n\nEven figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict, now hold significant political influence, with his party securing a considerable number of seats in the Parliament.  These internal struggles and the presence of radical factions threaten the fragile political process.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the initial impetus for intervention, I believe its continued presence has become more problematic than beneficial.  The lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about its legitimacy and raises concerns about the potential for a protracted conflict with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe stated goals of establishing democracy and securing access to oil appear to be at odds with the realities on the ground.  Imposing a foreign system of governance can be deeply disruptive and ultimately counterproductive, as it fails to address the underlying cultural and social dynamics within Iraqi society. Moreover, the prolonged presence of foreign troops has arguably exacerbated tensions and fueled resentment, contributing to instability and violence.\n\nThe human cost of this conflict is undeniable. Untold lives have been lost, families torn apart, and infrastructure decimated. It is essential to consider the impact on both Iraqi civilians and American service members, as well as the broader geopolitical implications of this prolonged involvement.\n\nUltimately, finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Iraq requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomacy, reconciliation, and respect for Iraqi sovereignty.",
            "The issue of legalizing  [specific action] is a complex one that raises fundamental questions about the role of government and religious freedom. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state provides a clear framework for understanding this issue.  \n\nThe document explicitly outlines this separation,  and attempting to legislate on matters of faith would be a direct violation of this established principle.  Furthermore, enacting a law prohibiting [specific action] would essentially endorse the beliefs of one religious group over others, creating a potentially divisive and unjust societal environment. \n\nThe United States has always prided itself on religious tolerance, and enshrining a law restricting religious practices would contradict this fundamental value.  \n\nI also believe that an amendment specifically targeting this issue would be unprecedented in its purpose. Most amendments are designed to limit government overreach, but this proposed amendment would, in fact, restrict the freedoms of individuals based on their religious beliefs. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe this matter should remain within the purview of religious institutions themselves.  The government should not intervene in matters of faith, and an amendment attempting to do so would be both inappropriate and detrimental to the fabric of our society.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue with many facets.  From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the conflict lacked transparency.  While the 9/11 attacks understandably fueled public outrage, the connection to Iraq felt tenuous at best.  The administration seemed to exploit this emotional vulnerability to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am a staunch opponent of war, particularly preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War: a costly endeavor with unpredictable consequences.  A significant number of American soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the situation has resulted in a power vacuum that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of their efforts in Vietnam.  However, such interventions often underestimate the complexities of nation-building.  \n\nThe challenges of establishing a functioning democracy in a country ravaged by conflict are immense. It requires time, patience, and a nuanced understanding of local cultures and politics.  The U.S. government's initial projections of a swift and decisive victory proved overly optimistic, leading to a protracted and increasingly costly conflict.\n\nMoreover, the war has raised ethical questions about the use of force and the role of the United States in global affairs.  If the stated goal is to promote democracy, why is Iraq singled out?  The potential for resource exploitation, particularly oil, cannot be disregarded.  Furthermore, the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while North Korea possesses them, raises concerns about the government's transparency and motives.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains fluid and fraught with uncertainty.  Finding a peaceful resolution is a daunting task, but it is essential to strive for an outcome that prioritizes the well-being of the Iraqi people and minimizes further loss of life.",
            "I strongly support the right to same-sex marriage. This stance has always been deeply held for me. I believe that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and, increasing scientific evidence suggests, has biological roots rather than solely sociological influences.  \n\nDenying individuals equal rights based on something beyond their control feels inherently unjust.  I've consistently advocated for marriage equality, as I see it as a matter of basic human dignity.\n\nIn my view, politics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage is a private matter, a matter of individual choice and commitment, best left to those involved and their immediate families.\n\nI live in a neighborhood where there are several openly gay couples who, despite not being legally married, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They raise dogs, walk the streets, and contribute to their community. Their lives exemplify the reality that love and commitment transcend legal definitions.\n\nI find attempts to define marriage narrowly and exclude same-sex couples deeply concerning. It feels like an overreach of authority, an attempt to impose a singular interpretation of a deeply personal concept.\n\nThere's a growing body of research indicating that sexual orientation has a biological basis. Studies suggest it's not simply a result of upbringing or environment but may be influenced by genetic and hormonal factors. This scientific understanding further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current legal landscape highlights the disparity. A heterosexual couple can easily marry without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to wed becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal affair, not subject to public scrutiny or government intervention. It should be a matter of individual choice, not a political debate.",
            "The nature of online platforms is inherently public. Once information is disseminated on the internet, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. This presents a significant challenge, particularly for individuals like myself who work in positions of responsibility, such as a resident advisor. I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. \n\nConsider the potential impact of sharing sensitive or controversial content.  Statements regarding violence or disruptive actions can be easily misinterpreted and cause alarm. Even seemingly innocuous remarks can be taken out of context and lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, for example, have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  If a concerning post is brought to their attention, they are obligated to investigate thoroughly. While it's important to respect individual privacy, the potential for harm outweighs these considerations in such situations.\n\nThis isn't to say that all online activity requires scrutiny. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine threats and harmless expressions. However, when there's a possibility of danger, schools must act responsibly.\n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when posting online.  While we may not be able to control how others perceive our words, we can choose our words carefully and understand the potential ramifications of our online presence.",
            "The ongoing conflict has stretched on for an extended period, and I believe the initial objectives have become obscured.  While the original intent may have been noble – to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system – I feel that we've strayed from that core purpose. \n\nThe conflict's duration raises concerns.  It's possible that motivations have shifted, perhaps influenced by past personal disputes between political figures. If the primary goal was indeed to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for intervention. However, if personal agendas played a role, it would cast a shadow on the conflict's legitimacy.\n\nIn the initial stages, the war served as a powerful statement, but its prolonged nature suggests a different intent.  It appears we're now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking to assert dominance rather than achieve a defined objective. This prolonged engagement is draining our resources, both financially and in terms of human life, while diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.\n\nWe should prioritize our own nation's needs, addressing challenges like poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and healthcare.  Billions of dollars spent on an unwinnable war could be better allocated to these crucial areas.  It's time to acknowledge that the conflict has lost its original purpose and bring it to a close.",
            "While I understand the concern about privacy, I believe that information shared online, particularly on platforms like Myspace, is generally accessible to a wider audience.  When you choose to display information on these sites, you essentially grant permission for others to view it.  \n\nThe concept of someone monitoring student profiles to prevent harm raises ethical concerns.  It seems impractical to assign such a task to a single individual, and it could potentially lead to discriminatory practices.  \n\nHowever, I agree that there are instances where online activity could signal potential danger.  It's a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring the safety of the community. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when sharing personal information online.\n\nMy own experience with social media platforms like Facebook has highlighted the potential risks.  It's unsettling to realize that strangers can access a considerable amount of information about us, even if we've taken steps to limit our exposure.  \n\nThe ability to connect with friends and family online is invaluable, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential downsides.  I strive to maintain a balance by being selective about my online connections and carefully considering what information I share.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed it from the outset, my perspective is more nuanced.  The widespread global disapproval of the war, reflected in polls conducted across the United States, Iraq, and internationally, is undeniable.  A significant majority of the population, including a large portion of U.S. troops stationed there, believe the conflict was ill-conceived and advocate for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been fraught with challenges from the beginning, and the prospect of a hasty exit also carries its own risks. The Middle East is a region marked by cultural and political complexities, and imposing Western democratic ideals onto a society with a distinct cultural framework has proven to be a difficult and often counterproductive endeavor.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against potential consequences.  It's clear that the war has had a devastating impact, both on Iraq and on American credibility on the world stage. \n\nAlthough I recognize the potential difficulties of a withdrawal, I believe that the Iraqi people's desire for our departure should be seriously considered.  A gradual and responsible exit strategy, perhaps extending over a year or more, could minimize the risks associated with a sudden departure. Ultimately, the long-term stability and well-being of the Iraqi people should be our paramount concern.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their field and societal expectations. \n\nWhile progress has been made towards gender equality, challenges persist.  Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, promotion opportunities may be limited due to historical biases. This can result in women being overlooked for leadership roles, even when they are equally or more qualified than their male counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, men can face discrimination in fields traditionally associated with women, such as caregiving or fashion. Societal norms often pressure men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to judgment or disapproval when they choose to stay at home or pursue non-traditional careers.\n\nFurthermore, individuals from diverse backgrounds may encounter discrimination based on their upbringing or communication style. This can create barriers to career advancement, regardless of their skills or qualifications.\n\nAddressing these complex issues requires a multifaceted approach that challenges societal norms and promotes inclusivity.  As we continue to evolve as a society, it is crucial to recognize and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender discrimination in all its forms.",

While decriminalization, which shifts the legal classification from a criminal offense to a minor infraction akin to a traffic ticket, has been implemented in some areas, its broader societal impacts remain a subject of debate.  \n\nOne argument in favor of decriminalization centers on the substantial financial burden associated with arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession. This cost extends to court proceedings, public defenders, and the judicial system itself.  \n\nProponents of decriminalization suggest that these resources could be more effectively allocated to essential public services, such as education, social welfare programs, and assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, opposition to decriminalization often stems from moral and social concerns. Some communities hold steadfast beliefs against marijuana use and resist any policy that might be perceived as condoning or normalizing it.\n\nThe impact of decriminalization on individual behavior and public perception also raises questions. While it aims to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, concerns remain about potential increases in accessibility and normalization, leading to issues like increased use among youth or potential impairment in public spaces. \n\nThe varying effects of marijuana on individuals, coupled with its continued legal gray areas, necessitate careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "My perspective on Catholicism is complex. While I admire its long-standing traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's stance on inclusivity.  While teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices, like the refusal to marry individuals from other faiths, seem contradictory. My parents' experience, with my father being Episcopalian and my mother Catholic, exemplifies this. Their union was not recognized within the Catholic Church solely because of my father's religion. This lack of tolerance, in my view, undermines the very message of love and acceptance that Catholicism espouses.\n\nFurthermore, there's a tension between doctrine and practice regarding social issues.  I believe allowing priests to marry could be a positive step, but the issue of child abuse within the clergy is a separate and deeply troubling concern. I don't believe marital status is a determining factor in such abhorrent behavior, as it stems from a fundamental moral failing.  Ultimately, addressing this issue requires comprehensive solutions that go beyond structural changes.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma, intertwining deeply with the fundamental principles of separation of church and state. Defining marriage, particularly in a manner that respects diverse viewpoints without causing offense, proves to be a significant challenge. \n\nPersonally, I believe the government should recognize civil unions as the appropriate framework for defining the legal rights and responsibilities associated with committed partnerships.  This approach avoids the entanglement of religious doctrines with legal definitions, mirroring how the government treats religious sacraments like baptism, which do not grant specific legal privileges.  \n\nIf two individuals enter into a civil union, their relationship should be recognized and protected by the government, regardless of the specific nature of their bond.  I feel that focusing on the fundamental aspect of two individuals uniting in a committed partnership, rather than the specific label of \"marriage,\"  is more inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the passionate arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach.  The Constitution is a foundational document that should be amended only for matters of paramount national importance. This particular issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic alteration to our fundamental law.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my views on homosexuality. While I value my many gay friends and believe in their right to live freely, I personally don't fully endorse their lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  I believe this is a matter best decided at the state level, allowing individual communities to determine what aligns with their values. \n\nDifferent states hold diverse political viewpoints, with some leaning Democratic and others Republican. It's natural that states with predominantly Democratic populations would be more likely to support gay marriage.  \n\nLiving in a state that legalizes same-sex marriage means accepting and respecting that decision, as it reflects the will of the people who reside there.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I support the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, but I feel that the decision should be made by individual states, not imposed nationally.  \n\nI disagree with the federal ban on gay marriage, as it disregards the autonomy of individual states.  \n\nThe President, while holding significant influence, should not dictate this highly personal and complex issue for the entire nation.  \n\nIt's a matter that should be left to the states to decide based on their unique circumstances and the will of their citizens. This allows for a more nuanced and democratic approach to this sensitive topic.",
            "The concept of privacy on platforms like Myspace is complex. While it's designed for public sharing, one must consider the potential consequences of what is posted.  School officials, while not explicitly authorized to monitor student activity on personal platforms, have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Accessing information, even if obtained indirectly, that could prevent harm or violence, might be justifiable in their pursuit of this duty.  \n\nHowever, the line blurs when it comes to proactive monitoring for minor infractions like underage drinking or smoking.  This raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse.  It's crucial to distinguish between preventing serious harm and policing everyday behaviors. \n\nThe permanence of online content is a significant factor.  Once something is posted, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove it completely. This underscores the importance of careful consideration before sharing anything online, especially when it comes to potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe goal should be to find a balance between protecting student privacy and ensuring a safe learning environment.  This requires open dialogue and clear guidelines regarding online behavior and expectations.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, the desire for retribution was strong. I believed military action was necessary to address the perceived threat and make those responsible accountable.  Looking back, I recognize that the emotional intensity surrounding the tragedy may have clouded our judgment. \n\nPerhaps we rushed into the conflict without a comprehensive strategy or a thorough understanding of the complexities of the situation. The lack of preparedness became evident as the conflict unfolded.  \n\nI've come to believe that external intervention alone cannot resolve the deeply rooted issues within the region. The ongoing internal struggles prevent a unified front against external threats. Our presence may inadvertently exacerbate these divisions and hinder progress towards lasting peace.\n\nThe nature of warfare differs significantly between cultures, and this disparity was a significant challenge.  The motivations and goals of the opposing forces were not always clear, making it difficult to achieve our objectives.\n\nWhile the initial impulse to respond to the attacks was understandable, I now question whether a more diplomatic approach might have been more effective in the long run.  We entered the conflict with a focus on retribution, which may have hindered our ability to build sustainable solutions.\n\nThe situation in the region remains complex and challenging.  It is essential to recognize the limitations of military intervention and explore alternative strategies that promote peace and stability. Ultimately, lasting solutions require a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and fosters cooperation among all parties involved."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe this can be partly attributed to its stance on certain social issues.  While the Church holds strong convictions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, these views are perceived by some as outdated.  \n\nA more contemporary approach to these matters might help the Church retain its following. I've heard that many individuals are distancing themselves from the Catholic Church due to disagreements with its positions on these issues.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a community that condemns it. Similarly, individuals who advocate for same-sex marriage might find the Church's stance on this issue incompatible with their beliefs. \n\nPersonally, I believe the Church should reconsider its strict regulations regarding female priests and married clergy.  \n\nWhile these changes may not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more inclusive and welcoming environment. After all, many other professions allow individuals to balance their personal lives with their work commitments.\n\nI think it's important for the Church to adapt to the evolving values of society.",
            "I personally don't have any objections to same-sex marriage.  I believe sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, not a choice.  Therefore, individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry, while allowing heterosexual couples to, seems discriminatory.  \n\nWhile I haven't extensively researched the topic, I strongly feel that it's unjust to limit marriage rights based on sexual orientation. People are born with different characteristics, including their sexual orientation, just as some are born left-handed and others right-handed.  It's not a decision anyone consciously makes.  \n\nI also believe that the federal government's role in this matter is limited. Marriage is a personal and societal institution, not a matter of national security or morality.  Government interference in such deeply personal choices feels inappropriate. It's important to respect individual autonomy and allow people to live their lives authentically without facing discrimination.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears. \n\nOne common concern is that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, the concept of \"family\" is diverse and evolving.  Just as heterosexual relationships vary widely, so do same-sex relationships.  The core elements of love, commitment, and shared responsibility transcend sexual orientation. \n\nLegal recognition of same-sex marriage is crucial for ensuring equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples.  This includes matters like property ownership, healthcare decisions, and inheritance. Denying these rights to same-sex couples creates a system of second-class citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that same-sex marriage violates religious beliefs is misplaced. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy.  While individuals are free to hold religious convictions, these beliefs should not dictate public policy that affects the rights of all citizens.\n\nOpponents often cite concerns about the impact of same-sex parenting on children.  However, extensive research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents.  The well-being of a child depends on the quality of the relationship they have with their parents, not their sexual orientation. \n\nUltimately, the fight for marriage equality is about basic human dignity and the right to live authentically.  It's about recognizing that love is love, regardless of who it is between.",
            "My summer job in a hospital pharmacy has given me a unique perspective on the complexities surrounding drug legality. While I understand the concerns about making certain substances readily available to the public, I believe a distinction should be made between recreational use and medicinal applications. \n\nThere are numerous drugs, even those classified as controlled substances, that are vital for therapeutic purposes within a medical setting.  Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples.  Denying access to potentially beneficial substances solely based on social stigma, as opposed to their inherent properties, seems illogical. \n\nThe debate surrounding marijuana is often clouded by misconceptions. While its potential for abuse exists, so does the potential for alcohol, which is legal.  A gradual approach to legalization, coupled with continued research and education, could help mitigate potential risks while allowing for responsible use and exploration of its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction.  Marijuana is not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine in terms of its potential for harm. By challenging the prevailing perception, we can create a more informed and nuanced conversation about its potential medical applications and responsible use.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to fit modern times. It's not as rigidly structured as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest: matching dresses, shoes, and purse. It was a part of my routine, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my classmates there on weekends. \n\nHowever, things have changed. The church now offers a mass specifically for teenagers, which is shorter and more casual.  People dress down more, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Families often arrive late, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. Even at the traditional morning masses, where I used to dress up, now people are more comfortable wearing jeans and khakis. \n\nThis shift towards casualness is the most noticeable change I've observed in the church. While I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this is the aspect that stands out to me. \n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I believe these issues wouldn't have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. After all, even married men can become pedophiles. The problem stems from the individual, not their marital status.  Becoming a priest is a personal choice, and those who wish to marry while practicing their faith might consider other religious denominations that allow this.\n\nI also think pedophilia has a biological basis, related to genetics. It's not something people simply choose; they are born with these tendencies.  While upbringing might play a small role, I believe genetics are the primary factor.  Marriage wouldn't change this inherent predisposition.\n\nIf the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a separate matter and deeply troubling. However, I don't believe they were always aware or complicit in every instance.",
            "The initial concept of the Iraq War wasn't entirely disagreeable, but the events of September 11th cast a long shadow.  It seemed to me that the war was, in part, a reaction to those attacks, used as a justification to intervene.  The Bush administration strongly linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, assertions that have since been proven false. This discrepancy, this lack of honesty, deeply troubled me. It fueled a sense of outrage about the entire war.\n\nThe Bush administration, in my view, openly misled the American people and has yet to acknowledge this. Even Colin Powell,  after his prominent presentation at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this constitutes a serious abuse of power, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution, a pattern that began after September 11th.\n\nThere's a perception, stemming from the testimony of former officials, that the administration entered office with a pre-existing intention to engage in military action.  A former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently dismissed, alleged as much in his book.  It seems younger Bush harbored a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's administration's experiences.  Additionally, there's a suspicion that the administration sought to secure energy resources as a long-term objective, a rather underhanded approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe war has persisted for far too long. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further casualties, it's clear that the current situation is unsustainable. The international community, led by the UN, is exploring alternatives, such as a coalition of neighboring nations—Syria and Saudi Arabia, for instance—to restore order.  However, this approach also raises concerns, as it potentially compromises Iraq's sovereignty.  The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and there are serious divisions within the Iraqi Parliament.\n\nEven figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict, now hold significant political influence, with his party securing a considerable number of seats in the Parliament.  These internal struggles and the presence of radical factions threaten the fragile political process.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the initial impetus for intervention, I believe its continued presence has become more problematic than beneficial.  The lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about its legitimacy and raises concerns about the potential for a protracted conflict with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe stated goals of establishing democracy and securing access to oil appear to be at odds with the realities on the ground.  Imposing a foreign system of governance can be deeply disruptive and ultimately counterproductive, as it fails to address the underlying cultural and social dynamics within Iraqi society. Moreover, the prolonged presence of foreign troops has arguably exacerbated tensions and fueled resentment, contributing to instability and violence.\n\nThe human cost of this conflict is undeniable. Untold lives have been lost, families torn apart, and infrastructure decimated. It is essential to consider the impact on both Iraqi civilians and American service members, as well as the broader geopolitical implications of this prolonged involvement.\n\nUltimately, finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Iraq requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomacy, reconciliation, and respect for Iraqi sovereignty.",
            "The issue of legalizing  [specific action] is a complex one that raises fundamental questions about the role of government and religious freedom. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state provides a clear framework for understanding this issue.  \n\nThe document explicitly outlines this separation,  and attempting to legislate on matters of faith would be a direct violation of this established principle.  Furthermore, enacting a law prohibiting [specific action] would essentially endorse the beliefs of one religious group over others, creating a potentially divisive and unjust societal environment. \n\nThe United States has always prided itself on religious tolerance, and enshrining a law restricting religious practices would contradict this fundamental value.  \n\nI also believe that an amendment specifically targeting this issue would be unprecedented in its purpose. Most amendments are designed to limit government overreach, but this proposed amendment would, in fact, restrict the freedoms of individuals based on their religious beliefs. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe this matter should remain within the purview of religious institutions themselves.  The government should not intervene in matters of faith, and an amendment attempting to do so would be both inappropriate and detrimental to the fabric of our society.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue with many facets.  From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the conflict lacked transparency.  While the 9/11 attacks understandably fueled public outrage, the connection to Iraq felt tenuous at best.  The administration seemed to exploit this emotional vulnerability to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am a staunch opponent of war, particularly preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War: a costly endeavor with unpredictable consequences.  A significant number of American soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the situation has resulted in a power vacuum that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of their efforts in Vietnam.  However, such interventions often underestimate the complexities of nation-building.  \n\nThe challenges of establishing a functioning democracy in a country ravaged by conflict are immense. It requires time, patience, and a nuanced understanding of local cultures and politics.  The U.S. government's initial projections of a swift and decisive victory proved overly optimistic, leading to a protracted and increasingly costly conflict.\n\nMoreover, the war has raised ethical questions about the use of force and the role of the United States in global affairs.  If the stated goal is to promote democracy, why is Iraq singled out?  The potential for resource exploitation, particularly oil, cannot be disregarded.  Furthermore, the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while North Korea possesses them, raises concerns about the government's transparency and motives.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains fluid and fraught with uncertainty.  Finding a peaceful resolution is a daunting task, but it is essential to strive for an outcome that prioritizes the well-being of the Iraqi people and minimizes further loss of life.",
            "I strongly support the right to same-sex marriage. This stance has always been deeply held for me. I believe that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and, increasing scientific evidence suggests, has biological roots rather than solely sociological influences.  \n\nDenying individuals equal rights based on something beyond their control feels inherently unjust.  I've consistently advocated for marriage equality, as I see it as a matter of basic human dignity.\n\nIn my view, politics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage is a private matter, a matter of individual choice and commitment, best left to those involved and their immediate families.\n\nI live in a neighborhood where there are several openly gay couples who, despite not being legally married, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They raise dogs, walk the streets, and contribute to their community. Their lives exemplify the reality that love and commitment transcend legal definitions.\n\nI find attempts to define marriage narrowly and exclude same-sex couples deeply concerning. It feels like an overreach of authority, an attempt to impose a singular interpretation of a deeply personal concept.\n\nThere's a growing body of research indicating that sexual orientation has a biological basis. Studies suggest it's not simply a result of upbringing or environment but may be influenced by genetic and hormonal factors. This scientific understanding further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current legal landscape highlights the disparity. A heterosexual couple can easily marry without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to wed becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal affair, not subject to public scrutiny or government intervention. It should be a matter of individual choice, not a political debate.",
            "The nature of online platforms is inherently public. Once information is disseminated on the internet, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. This presents a significant challenge, particularly for individuals like myself who work in positions of responsibility, such as a resident advisor. I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. \n\nConsider the potential impact of sharing sensitive or controversial content.  Statements regarding violence or disruptive actions can be easily misinterpreted and cause alarm. Even seemingly innocuous remarks can be taken out of context and lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, for example, have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  If a concerning post is brought to their attention, they are obligated to investigate thoroughly. While it's important to respect individual privacy, the potential for harm outweighs these considerations in such situations.\n\nThis isn't to say that all online activity requires scrutiny. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine threats and harmless expressions. However, when there's a possibility of danger, schools must act responsibly.\n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when posting online.  While we may not be able to control how others perceive our words, we can choose our words carefully and understand the potential ramifications of our online presence.",
            "The ongoing conflict has stretched on for an extended period, and I believe the initial objectives have become obscured.  While the original intent may have been noble – to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system – I feel that we've strayed from that core purpose. \n\nThe conflict's duration raises concerns.  It's possible that motivations have shifted, perhaps influenced by past personal disputes between political figures. If the primary goal was indeed to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for intervention. However, if personal agendas played a role, it would cast a shadow on the conflict's legitimacy.\n\nIn the initial stages, the war served as a powerful statement, but its prolonged nature suggests a different intent.  It appears we're now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking to assert dominance rather than achieve a defined objective. This prolonged engagement is draining our resources, both financially and in terms of human life, while diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.\n\nWe should prioritize our own nation's needs, addressing challenges like poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and healthcare.  Billions of dollars spent on an unwinnable war could be better allocated to these crucial areas.  It's time to acknowledge that the conflict has lost its original purpose and bring it to a close.",
            "While I understand the concern about privacy, I believe that information shared online, particularly on platforms like Myspace, is generally accessible to a wider audience.  When you choose to display information on these sites, you essentially grant permission for others to view it.  \n\nThe concept of someone monitoring student profiles to prevent harm raises ethical concerns.  It seems impractical to assign such a task to a single individual, and it could potentially lead to discriminatory practices.  \n\nHowever, I agree that there are instances where online activity could signal potential danger.  It's a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring the safety of the community. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when sharing personal information online.\n\nMy own experience with social media platforms like Facebook has highlighted the potential risks.  It's unsettling to realize that strangers can access a considerable amount of information about us, even if we've taken steps to limit our exposure.  \n\nThe ability to connect with friends and family online is invaluable, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential downsides.  I strive to maintain a balance by being selective about my online connections and carefully considering what information I share.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed it from the outset, my perspective is more nuanced.  The widespread global disapproval of the war, reflected in polls conducted across the United States, Iraq, and internationally, is undeniable.  A significant majority of the population, including a large portion of U.S. troops stationed there, believe the conflict was ill-conceived and advocate for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been fraught with challenges from the beginning, and the prospect of a hasty exit also carries its own risks. The Middle East is a region marked by cultural and political complexities, and imposing Western democratic ideals onto a society with a distinct cultural framework has proven to be a difficult and often counterproductive endeavor.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against potential consequences.  It's clear that the war has had a devastating impact, both on Iraq and on American credibility on the world stage. \n\nAlthough I recognize the potential difficulties of a withdrawal, I believe that the Iraqi people's desire for our departure should be seriously considered.  A gradual and responsible exit strategy, perhaps extending over a year or more, could minimize the risks associated with a sudden departure. Ultimately, the long-term stability and well-being of the Iraqi people should be our paramount concern.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their field and societal expectations. \n\nWhile progress has been made towards gender equality, challenges persist.  Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, promotion opportunities may be limited due to historical biases. This can result in women being overlooked for leadership roles, even when they are equally or more qualified than their male counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, men can face discrimination in fields traditionally associated with women, such as caregiving or fashion. Societal norms often pressure men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to judgment or disapproval when they choose to stay at home or pursue non-traditional careers.\n\nFurthermore, individuals from diverse backgrounds may encounter discrimination based on their upbringing or communication style. This can create barriers to career advancement, regardless of their skills or qualifications.\n\nAddressing these complex issues requires a multifaceted approach that challenges societal norms and promotes inclusivity.  As we continue to evolve as a society, it is crucial to recognize and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender discrimination in all its forms.",

While decriminalization, which shifts the legal classification from a criminal offense to a minor infraction akin to a traffic ticket, has been implemented in some areas, its broader societal impacts remain a subject of debate.  \n\nOne argument in favor of decriminalization centers on the substantial financial burden associated with arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession. This cost extends to court proceedings, public defenders, and the judicial system itself.  \n\nProponents of decriminalization suggest that these resources could be more effectively allocated to essential public services, such as education, social welfare programs, and assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, opposition to decriminalization often stems from moral and social concerns. Some communities hold steadfast beliefs against marijuana use and resist any policy that might be perceived as condoning or normalizing it.\n\nThe impact of decriminalization on individual behavior and public perception also raises questions. While it aims to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, concerns remain about potential increases in accessibility and normalization, leading to issues like increased use among youth or potential impairment in public spaces. \n\nThe varying effects of marijuana on individuals, coupled with its continued legal gray areas, necessitate careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "My perspective on Catholicism is complex. While I admire its long-standing traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's stance on inclusivity.  While teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices, like the refusal to marry individuals from other faiths, seem contradictory. My parents' experience, with my father being Episcopalian and my mother Catholic, exemplifies this. Their union was not recognized within the Catholic Church solely because of my father's religion. This lack of tolerance, in my view, undermines the very message of love and acceptance that Catholicism espouses.\n\nFurthermore, there's a tension between doctrine and practice regarding social issues.  I believe allowing priests to marry could be a positive step, but the issue of child abuse within the clergy is a separate and deeply troubling concern. I don't believe marital status is a determining factor in such abhorrent behavior, as it stems from a fundamental moral failing.  Ultimately, addressing this issue requires comprehensive solutions that go beyond structural changes.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma, intertwining deeply with the fundamental principles of separation of church and state. Defining marriage, particularly in a manner that respects diverse viewpoints without causing offense, proves to be a significant challenge. \n\nPersonally, I believe the government should recognize civil unions as the appropriate framework for defining the legal rights and responsibilities associated with committed partnerships.  This approach avoids the entanglement of religious doctrines with legal definitions, mirroring how the government treats religious sacraments like baptism, which do not grant specific legal privileges.  \n\nIf two individuals enter into a civil union, their relationship should be recognized and protected by the government, regardless of the specific nature of their bond.  I feel that focusing on the fundamental aspect of two individuals uniting in a committed partnership, rather than the specific label of \"marriage,\"  is more inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the passionate arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach.  The Constitution is a foundational document that should be amended only for matters of paramount national importance. This particular issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic alteration to our fundamental law.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my views on homosexuality. While I value my many gay friends and believe in their right to live freely, I personally don't fully endorse their lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  I believe this is a matter best decided at the state level, allowing individual communities to determine what aligns with their values. \n\nDifferent states hold diverse political viewpoints, with some leaning Democratic and others Republican. It's natural that states with predominantly Democratic populations would be more likely to support gay marriage.  \n\nLiving in a state that legalizes same-sex marriage means accepting and respecting that decision, as it reflects the will of the people who reside there.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I support the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, but I feel that the decision should be made by individual states, not imposed nationally.  \n\nI disagree with the federal ban on gay marriage, as it disregards the autonomy of individual states.  \n\nThe President, while holding significant influence, should not dictate this highly personal and complex issue for the entire nation.  \n\nIt's a matter that should be left to the states to decide based on their unique circumstances and the will of their citizens. This allows for a more nuanced and democratic approach to this sensitive topic.",
            "The concept of privacy on platforms like Myspace is complex. While it's designed for public sharing, one must consider the potential consequences of what is posted.  School officials, while not explicitly authorized to monitor student activity on personal platforms, have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Accessing information, even if obtained indirectly, that could prevent harm or violence, might be justifiable in their pursuit of this duty.  \n\nHowever, the line blurs when it comes to proactive monitoring for minor infractions like underage drinking or smoking.  This raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse.  It's crucial to distinguish between preventing serious harm and policing everyday behaviors. \n\nThe permanence of online content is a significant factor.  Once something is posted, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove it completely. This underscores the importance of careful consideration before sharing anything online, especially when it comes to potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe goal should be to find a balance between protecting student privacy and ensuring a safe learning environment.  This requires open dialogue and clear guidelines regarding online behavior and expectations.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, the desire for retribution was strong. I believed military action was necessary to address the perceived threat and make those responsible accountable.  Looking back, I recognize that the emotional intensity surrounding the tragedy may have clouded our judgment. \n\nPerhaps we rushed into the conflict without a comprehensive strategy or a thorough understanding of the complexities of the situation. The lack of preparedness became evident as the conflict unfolded.  \n\nI've come to believe that external intervention alone cannot resolve the deeply rooted issues within the region. The ongoing internal struggles prevent a unified front against external threats. Our presence may inadvertently exacerbate these divisions and hinder progress towards lasting peace.\n\nThe nature of warfare differs significantly between cultures, and this disparity was a significant challenge.  The motivations and goals of the opposing forces were not always clear, making it difficult to achieve our objectives.\n\nWhile the initial impulse to respond to the attacks was understandable, I now question whether a more diplomatic approach might have been more effective in the long run.  We entered the conflict with a focus on retribution, which may have hindered our ability to build sustainable solutions.\n\nThe situation in the region remains complex and challenging.  It is essential to recognize the limitations of military intervention and explore alternative strategies that promote peace and stability. Ultimately, lasting solutions require a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and fosters cooperation among all parties involved."
