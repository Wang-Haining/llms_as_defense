            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a challenge in retaining its members. I believe this decline is partly due to its stance on certain contemporary issues.  \n\nWhile the Church holds strong, traditional views on topics like marriage equality, abortion, and contraception, these positions may not resonate with a modern audience.  \n\nMany individuals find the Church's perspective on these matters outdated and, consequently, feel alienated.  They seek a faith community that aligns with their own beliefs and values.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a church that vehemently opposes it. Similarly, someone who advocates for same-sex marriage might not find a welcoming environment in a Church that does not. \n\nPerhaps the Church could benefit from a more inclusive and adaptable approach to these complex issues. Embracing a wider range of perspectives might help bridge the gap and attract new generations of believers.  \n\nThe Church's assertion that priests are \"married to God\" and devote their lives solely to their ministry doesn't seem to adequately account for the human experience of wanting both a spiritual calling and a personal life.  Allowing priests to marry could potentially address this perceived disconnect and offer a more relatable model for aspiring clergy.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a conscious decision, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people responsible for something they are born with. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that a man and a woman's union is inherently different or superior.\n\nWhile I haven't extensively studied the legal and societal implications of same-sex marriage, I strongly feel that it's a matter of personal liberty and should be respected.  \n\nPerhaps the government's role shouldn't extend to regulating personal relationships, especially those that don't infringe upon the rights or well-being of others.  It seems to me that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and given the same opportunities for happiness and commitment as heterosexual couples.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness. Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions about same-sex relationships.  It's crucial to recognize that the dynamics within a committed partnership, regardless of sexual orientation, share many commonalities. \n\nOpponents sometimes cite concerns about societal impacts, particularly regarding children raised by same-sex couples. However, extensive research indicates that children thrive in loving and supportive environments, and the parenting styles of same-sex couples are demonstrably comparable to those of heterosexual couples.  \n\nThe issue of marriage equality transcends religious beliefs and delves into the realm of civil rights. Access to legal recognition and the benefits associated with marriage, such as healthcare and property rights, should be extended equally to all committed couples. \n\nAdvocating for a government-sanctioned distinction between different types of relationships is akin to segregation, perpetuating inequality under the guise of differing moral viewpoints.\n\nWhile personal beliefs are important, imposing them on an entire nation through legal means is both unethical and inconsistent with the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. The government should uphold the rights of all its citizens, ensuring that legal frameworks reflect the values of equality and justice.",
            "The experience I gained working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer truly shaped my perspective on drug legality. While I understand the concerns surrounding the illicit status of certain substances, I believe the classification of a drug as illegal shouldn't automatically preclude its potential medicinal benefits. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, that are legally prescribed and utilized in pharmacies for their therapeutic value.  Denying the potential benefits of marijuana simply because of societal stigma seems illogical to me.  We should prioritize exploring its medicinal applications rather than dismissing them outright.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol presents a complex dilemma. Both substances can be misused, leading to negative consequences. However, I believe a measured approach is necessary.  Gradually integrating marijuana into legal frameworks, rather than a sudden legalization, might mitigate potential abuse while allowing for responsible use.  \n\nThe negative public perception surrounding marijuana stems largely from its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that marijuana's potential for harm pales in comparison to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By challenging the misconception of marijuana as inherently dangerous, we can create an environment where its responsible use, particularly for medical purposes, is more readily accepted.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to suit the modern world. It's not as rigid as it once was. Looking back, when I was younger, every Sunday was a big event. I'd put on my best attire – a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse to complete the look. That was the norm for me, especially since I attended a private school where I saw my friends every weekend. We'd all gather at church.\n\nNow, things have changed.  They've introduced a special mass for teenagers, keeping it concise at thirty minutes.  People dress much more casually, especially during summer. It's common to see people in beach attire, straight from the shore. You'll even find families rushing in late.  \n\nEven at the traditional morning masses, where I used to be meticulous about my appearance, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. While khakis are perfectly acceptable, the overall trend leans towards casual wear. \n\nPersonally, this shift in attire is the most noticeable change I've observed. As for other aspects of the church, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. I'm not deeply involved in the church's politics, but these changes are evident in my experience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests, I believe these issues are complex and deeply rooted.  \n\nI don't think simply allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have prevented these occurrences.  After all, pedophilia can affect anyone, regardless of marital status. It's a deeply personal struggle, and I believe it stems from individual factors rather than religious rules.  \n\nIt's important to remember that becoming a priest is a personal choice. Other religions allow for married clergy, such as the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both a religious calling and marriage, they might consider exploring those options.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War held some appeal, but the aftermath of September 11th cast a long shadow over the decision-making process. It appears that the Bush administration utilized  the attacks as a pretext to justify military action, linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This disconnect between stated justifications and reality deeply troubles me. The administration's actions seem to demonstrate a blatant disregard for truthfulness and transparency with the American people.\n\nColin Powell's subsequent admission that he harbored doubts about the evidence presented at the UN further reinforces this concern.  To mislead the nation on such a momentous occasion is, in my view, a grave offense, bordering on impeachable.  \n\nThere's a pervasive feeling that the Bush administration's approach towards the Constitution has been one of erosion since September 11th.  It's been suggested, albeit by those outside the administration, that their ambition from the outset included military intervention.  \n\nThe motivations behind the war remain complex and multifaceted.  One theory posits a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from the previous administration's dealings with Iraq.  Another proposes an underlying desire to secure American energy interests in the region, a strategy I find deeply problematic. \n\nThe duration of the conflict has undeniably caused immense suffering, and a hasty withdrawal could exacerbate the situation by triggering civil strife and further bloodshed.  The current plan, involving a coalition of neighboring nations, presents its own set of challenges.  It raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and the potential for long-term instability. \n\nThe interim government's fragility is evident, with the Parliament seemingly ineffective and the Prime Minister lacking substantial control. The presence of powerful factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party further complicates the political landscape, creating a volatile environment rife with internal conflict.",
            "The ongoing conflict in Iraq presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivation for intervention, I believe the current situation lacks a clear purpose. The absence of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about the legitimacy of our involvement. \n\nThe stated goals of fostering democracy and securing energy resources seem at odds with the reality on the ground.  Attempts to impose our political system on a culture vastly different from our own risk exacerbating tensions and fostering resentment.  The potential for long-term instability and the erosion of our national image as a result of continued involvement are significant concerns. \n\nFurthermore, the human cost of this protracted conflict is undeniable. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are at stake. It's essential to consider the well-being of all parties involved and explore alternative paths to a peaceful resolution.",
            "The issue of legalization presents a complex dilemma, especially considering the foundational principles of the United States. I firmly believe that the Constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state should serve as a guiding principle in this matter. The document explicitly outlines this separation, and any attempt to legislate on this issue would, in my view, constitute a direct challenge to this established tenet. \n\nFurthermore, imposing legal restrictions on a practice that is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs raises serious concerns about the government's overreach.  Different religious communities hold diverse perspectives on this matter, and attempting to codify one specific belief system into law would inevitably disadvantage others. \n\nThe Constitution has long been lauded for promoting religious tolerance, and enacting an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very foundation.  It's crucial to remember that the Constitution's purpose is primarily to safeguard individual liberties and limit government power.  An amendment aimed at restricting individual choices rather than government actions would be a significant departure from this principle.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the government should abstain from interfering in this domain.  It is not the role of the state to dictate the internal practices of religious institutions.  Ultimately, the decision should rest with individual religious communities, guided by their own doctrines and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  While the initial justification for the invasion centered around concerns about weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism, many believe the true motives were more multifaceted.  \n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that the government's portrayal of the conflict to the American public was not entirely transparent.  The emotional fallout from the September 11th attacks was undoubtedly exploited to garner public support for the war, potentially overshadowing a more nuanced understanding of the situation. \n\nPersonally, I hold reservations about preemptive military action in general.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the historical mistakes made during the Vietnam War, highlighting the dangers of underestimating the complexities of foreign intervention.  \n\nThe high number of American casualties is a tragic consequence of the conflict, and the long-term ramifications of the removal of the Iraqi government have proven to be far-reaching and difficult to predict.\n\nThe United States' attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a challenging endeavor, mirroring the difficulties encountered during the Vietnam War.  The complexities of nation-building and the inherent resistance to foreign influence often lead to protracted and costly conflicts.\n\nThe war has raised important ethical questions about the role of the United States in global affairs.  The decision to intervene militarily should not be taken lightly, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences, both short-term and long-term, is essential.\n\nI believe that a more thorough and transparent approach to foreign policy is crucial, one that prioritizes diplomacy and international cooperation whenever possible.  The Iraq War serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for careful consideration before resorting to military force.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage is clear: I wholeheartedly support it.  This belief stems from a fundamental understanding that personal preferences, particularly regarding relationships, should be respected and protected.  \n\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests a biological basis for sexual orientation, further emphasizing the argument against restricting rights based on something beyond an individual's control. Denying individuals equal rights due to their inherent nature is, in my view, deeply inhumane.  I've always been a vocal advocate for marriage equality.\n\nPolitics and government should not dictate personal choices like marriage. It's a matter of individual and familial autonomy, not a public issue.  Even in my own neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who, despite not being legally recognized, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They contribute to their community, raise children, and deserve the same legal recognition and protections.  \n\nWhen public figures attempt to impose their own interpretations of marriage, it feels intrusive and dismissive of the lived experiences of countless individuals.  \n\nResearch increasingly points to a biological predisposition for sexual orientation. It's not a choice, and it's not a result of sociological factors. This biological basis further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nMarriage, at its core, is a personal commitment. While heterosexual couples can easily choose to marry discreetly, the same isn't true for same-sex couples.  Their decisions are often subject to public scrutiny and debate, highlighting the need for greater acceptance and legal equality.  Marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle subject to political and social agendas.",
            "The digital landscape presents unique challenges regarding privacy and responsibility.  Once information is shared online, it enters the public sphere and can significantly influence how others perceive an individual. This raises important questions about the consequences of our digital footprints. \n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts, even those intended as jokes, have been misinterpreted and raised concerns.  The internet's wide reach means that information can quickly spread beyond the intended audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, in particular, face the difficult task of balancing the need to protect students with the right to free expression.  While it's crucial to prevent potential harm, it's equally important to respect students' privacy.  \n\nA delicate line exists between monitoring for safety concerns and overstepping boundaries.  While schools may be obligated to investigate credible threats, it's essential to avoid intrusive surveillance practices.  Open communication and trust between students and school officials are vital in navigating these complex issues.  \n\nUltimately, individuals bear responsibility for the content they share online.  Before posting, it's important to consider the potential impact on oneself and others.  The internet offers a powerful platform for connection and expression, but it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial intention, to establish democracy in a nation lacking democratic principles, seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. \n\nIt feels as though the conflict has evolved into a demonstration of power, rather than a genuine effort to promote democracy. Concerns exist regarding the motivations behind the war's initiation, particularly potential connections to past disputes between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the primary objective was indeed to bring democracy to a country lacking political fairness, that would be a justifiable reason. However, any personal agendas involved would undoubtedly undermine the ethical foundation of the war.\n\nDespite the initial impact and statement made in the early months, the prolonged nature of the conflict—spanning several years—is deeply troubling. It appears that the war has become self-perpetuating, with the focus shifting from achieving a clear objective to simply continuing the fight, seeking a decisive victory.\n\nThe war's extended duration has become detrimental.  The country's government and its people must eventually be responsible for their own governance. We've reached a point where our continued involvement is draining our own economy, diverting resources from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Billions are being spent on a conflict that no longer serves its original purpose. \n\nIt's crucial to prioritize domestic needs and allocate resources effectively. The ongoing war diverts essential funds from vital areas that require immediate attention.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one.  While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, there are still ethical considerations.  For instance, while users choose to share information, it's unsettling to think that someone could misuse that information, especially to harm others.  \n\nThere's a fine line between responsible monitoring and unwarranted intrusion.  It's difficult to imagine a school system effectively monitoring student activity on social media without crossing that line.  Such a system could easily lead to unfair targeting and discrimination.  \n\nHowever, the potential for harm is real.  I've personally experienced the unsettling feeling of strangers contacting me on platforms like Facebook, knowing personal details about me that I hadn't publicly shared. It highlights the vulnerability of online information and the need for caution.\n\nThe issue of schools banning social media use by students raises questions about freedom of expression and the role of technology in education.  While I understand the potential dangers, I believe outright bans might not be the most effective solution.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach, focusing on digital literacy and responsible online behavior, would be more beneficial.",
            "The Iraq War has been a deeply complex issue, and my perspective on it has evolved over time. While I understand the initial justifications for the intervention, the ongoing situation has raised serious concerns.  \n\nPublic opinion, both domestically and internationally, has consistently indicated widespread disapproval of the war's conduct and its lasting consequences. Polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and individuals globally believe the war was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, advocating for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe war's impact has been undeniably devastating, exacerbating existing tensions and instability in the region.  The cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East make it challenging to impose solutions from the outside. Attempts to establish democracy in a region with deeply entrenched traditions and power structures have proven to be deeply problematic.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been based on a thorough assessment of the potential ramifications. The consequences, both immediate and long-term, have been far-reaching and have created a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe possibility of a complete withdrawal from Iraq remains a contentious topic. While I recognize the complexities involved, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the voices of the Iraqi people. Their desire for self-determination and their calls for our departure should be seriously considered.  \n\nA gradual withdrawal, conducted responsibly and in consultation with Iraqi leaders, might be a more palatable option. However, the urgency for a definitive exit strategy is undeniable.  The consequences of prolonged military involvement continue to weigh heavily on both Iraq and the United States.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it often manifests differently depending on the field and societal expectations. While progress has been made towards gender equality, certain industries and roles continue to exhibit biases.\n\n For example, women frequently encounter a \"glass ceiling\" where, despite qualifications, they may face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to historical gender roles and societal perceptions. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children often encounter prejudice and societal pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms.\n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where male designers may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable simply because they do not adhere to stereotypically masculine aesthetics. These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of gender discrimination, demonstrating how societal expectations and ingrained biases can impact individuals regardless of their gender.\n\nWhile change is gradual, the increasing representation of women in leadership roles and the growing acceptance of diverse family structures suggest that societal attitudes are evolving.  It is crucial to continue challenging these biases and promote inclusion in all aspects of society.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex, encompassing both legal and social implications.  \n\nDecriminalization, as opposed to full legalization, shifts the focus from criminal offenses to civil infractions. This means individuals caught with marijuana might face citations similar to traffic violations, rather than arrest and prosecution.  While this diminishes the immediate legal consequences, long-term ramifications like employment hurdles remain a concern.\n\nHowever, decriminalization presents financial benefits for municipalities. The costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration can be substantial. By diverting resources from marijuana enforcement, communities could potentially allocate funds towards essential services such as education, social programs, and homelessness support.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization gains traction in areas with more progressive social values, where financial considerations and a desire for social reform are prioritized. Denver, for example, has embraced decriminalization, potentially freeing up resources for community betterment.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential for increased marijuana use if legalized, mirroring the accessibility of cigarettes.  \n\nThe societal stigma surrounding marijuana use also persists, and widespread availability could lead to discomfort and awkwardness in certain contexts. \n\nUltimately, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, and its impact on individual lifestyles and decision-making is multifaceted.  A nuanced approach is essential when considering the legalization debate, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "While I respect the enduring traditions of the Catholic Church, I believe that maintaining relevance in a changing world requires adaptability. There are certain aspects of Catholicism, such as the emphasis on weekly church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine, that can feel exclusionary.  \n\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith marriage faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This experience highlighted a perceived contradiction between the Church's teachings of love and acceptance and its reluctance to embrace individuals from diverse religious backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, some Catholic practices seem outdated, particularly regarding the celibacy requirement for priests. While I support the idea of allowing priests to marry, I recognize that such a change might not necessarily address issues of misconduct. \n\nUltimately, I believe that the root causes of such problems lie beyond marital status and require multifaceted solutions. It's important to remember that individuals who engage in harmful acts, such as child abuse, often do so regardless of their personal circumstances.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage is undeniably complex, residing at the intersection of deeply held religious beliefs and the fundamental principles of individual liberty and equality. \n\nDetermining the appropriate legal framework for marriage presents a significant challenge. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, suggesting that the government should not dictate religious practices or doctrines. On the other hand, marriage has historically been recognized as a societal institution with legal and social implications, leading to questions about the role of government in defining and regulating it.\n\nSome argue that marriage should be solely a religious sacrament, while others believe it should be a civil contract governed by the state.  The potential for legal recognition of same-sex marriages raises concerns about the impact on religious freedom and traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIt's important to consider the diverse perspectives on this issue and engage in respectful dialogue to find a solution that balances the rights of all individuals.  While I believe that civil unions offer a viable alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, I acknowledge the strong emotional and personal significance that marriage holds for many. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage should be decided through a thoughtful and inclusive process that respects both individual liberties and the principles of equality.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my perspective on homosexuality. It's a complex issue for me, as I value my friendships with individuals who identify as gay. While I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle, I believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to determine its own laws regarding marriage. The United States is a diverse nation with varying political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states, for instance, are more likely to support same-sex marriage, reflecting the values of their constituents.  \n\nIndividuals choosing to reside in a particular state should respect the legal framework and social norms established by that state.  Conversely, I believe a national mandate on such a sensitive topic would be inappropriate, as it would disregard the diverse viewpoints and cultural contexts across the country.\n\nI firmly believe in equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Therefore, I support a state-by-state approach to legalization, allowing each community to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and accommodating society while respecting individual autonomy and local control.  \n\nThe current federal ban on gay marriage, in my opinion, oversteps the bounds of federal authority. It's a matter best left to the individual states to decide.  Furthermore, the political landscape is constantly evolving. A future administration with different priorities could potentially overturn this ban, leading to a back-and-forth situation.  \n\nA state-by-state approach allows for a more nuanced and enduring solution, empowering communities to shape their own destinies and create a more harmonious and just society.",
            "The concept of privacy in the digital age is complex. While MySpace, for instance, presents itself as a public platform, the expectation of complete visibility can be misleading. Individuals might not always anticipate the potential consequences of their online actions, especially when it comes to sensitive information.\n\nHowever, when considering the safety and security of students, the boundaries of privacy can become blurred. School officials, entrusted with the well-being of their students, have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent potential harm.\n\nIf accessing social media platforms like MySpace serves as a tool to identify and address threats, it could be argued that the potential benefit outweighs the infringement on privacy.  The idea of schools monitoring student activity online is controversial, but the goal of creating a safe learning environment for all is paramount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact. Once information is shared online, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to fully remove it. This permanence necessitates careful consideration of the content we post and the potential consequences it could have on our future.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between individual privacy and collective safety is a delicate and ongoing challenge in our increasingly interconnected world.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I felt a surge of anger and a strong desire for retribution. I believed that military action against those responsible was necessary and justified. However, with time, I've come to question the wisdom of our involvement. \n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding 9/11 may have overshadowed a careful consideration of the long-term consequences. It seems we entered the conflict hastily, lacking a comprehensive plan and unprepared for the complexities of the situation. \n\nLooking back, I believe the intervention has ultimately been counterproductive. The ongoing conflict has fueled instability and division within the region, hindering any possibility of lasting peace. It's become increasingly clear that external intervention is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted issues at play. \n\nThe culture of war in that part of the world is vastly different from our own. Their methods are often brutal and their motivations complex, making it difficult to achieve our objectives through traditional means.  \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now believe that a more diplomatic approach would have been more effective. We should focus on fostering understanding and cooperation rather than resorting to military force.  \n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and divisive affair. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider a more sustainable path towards peace. We need to prioritize diplomacy and work towards building bridges rather than walls."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a challenge in retaining its members. I believe this decline is partly due to its stance on certain contemporary issues.  \n\nWhile the Church holds strong, traditional views on topics like marriage equality, abortion, and contraception, these positions may not resonate with a modern audience.  \n\nMany individuals find the Church's perspective on these matters outdated and, consequently, feel alienated.  They seek a faith community that aligns with their own beliefs and values.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a church that vehemently opposes it. Similarly, someone who advocates for same-sex marriage might not find a welcoming environment in a Church that does not. \n\nPerhaps the Church could benefit from a more inclusive and adaptable approach to these complex issues. Embracing a wider range of perspectives might help bridge the gap and attract new generations of believers.  \n\nThe Church's assertion that priests are \"married to God\" and devote their lives solely to their ministry doesn't seem to adequately account for the human experience of wanting both a spiritual calling and a personal life.  Allowing priests to marry could potentially address this perceived disconnect and offer a more relatable model for aspiring clergy.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a conscious decision, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people responsible for something they are born with. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that a man and a woman's union is inherently different or superior.\n\nWhile I haven't extensively studied the legal and societal implications of same-sex marriage, I strongly feel that it's a matter of personal liberty and should be respected.  \n\nPerhaps the government's role shouldn't extend to regulating personal relationships, especially those that don't infringe upon the rights or well-being of others.  It seems to me that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and given the same opportunities for happiness and commitment as heterosexual couples.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness. Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions about same-sex relationships.  It's crucial to recognize that the dynamics within a committed partnership, regardless of sexual orientation, share many commonalities. \n\nOpponents sometimes cite concerns about societal impacts, particularly regarding children raised by same-sex couples. However, extensive research indicates that children thrive in loving and supportive environments, and the parenting styles of same-sex couples are demonstrably comparable to those of heterosexual couples.  \n\nThe issue of marriage equality transcends religious beliefs and delves into the realm of civil rights. Access to legal recognition and the benefits associated with marriage, such as healthcare and property rights, should be extended equally to all committed couples. \n\nAdvocating for a government-sanctioned distinction between different types of relationships is akin to segregation, perpetuating inequality under the guise of differing moral viewpoints.\n\nWhile personal beliefs are important, imposing them on an entire nation through legal means is both unethical and inconsistent with the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. The government should uphold the rights of all its citizens, ensuring that legal frameworks reflect the values of equality and justice.",
            "The experience I gained working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer truly shaped my perspective on drug legality. While I understand the concerns surrounding the illicit status of certain substances, I believe the classification of a drug as illegal shouldn't automatically preclude its potential medicinal benefits. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, that are legally prescribed and utilized in pharmacies for their therapeutic value.  Denying the potential benefits of marijuana simply because of societal stigma seems illogical to me.  We should prioritize exploring its medicinal applications rather than dismissing them outright.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol presents a complex dilemma. Both substances can be misused, leading to negative consequences. However, I believe a measured approach is necessary.  Gradually integrating marijuana into legal frameworks, rather than a sudden legalization, might mitigate potential abuse while allowing for responsible use.  \n\nThe negative public perception surrounding marijuana stems largely from its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that marijuana's potential for harm pales in comparison to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By challenging the misconception of marijuana as inherently dangerous, we can create an environment where its responsible use, particularly for medical purposes, is more readily accepted.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to suit the modern world. It's not as rigid as it once was. Looking back, when I was younger, every Sunday was a big event. I'd put on my best attire – a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse to complete the look. That was the norm for me, especially since I attended a private school where I saw my friends every weekend. We'd all gather at church.\n\nNow, things have changed.  They've introduced a special mass for teenagers, keeping it concise at thirty minutes.  People dress much more casually, especially during summer. It's common to see people in beach attire, straight from the shore. You'll even find families rushing in late.  \n\nEven at the traditional morning masses, where I used to be meticulous about my appearance, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. While khakis are perfectly acceptable, the overall trend leans towards casual wear. \n\nPersonally, this shift in attire is the most noticeable change I've observed. As for other aspects of the church, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. I'm not deeply involved in the church's politics, but these changes are evident in my experience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests, I believe these issues are complex and deeply rooted.  \n\nI don't think simply allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have prevented these occurrences.  After all, pedophilia can affect anyone, regardless of marital status. It's a deeply personal struggle, and I believe it stems from individual factors rather than religious rules.  \n\nIt's important to remember that becoming a priest is a personal choice. Other religions allow for married clergy, such as the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both a religious calling and marriage, they might consider exploring those options.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War held some appeal, but the aftermath of September 11th cast a long shadow over the decision-making process. It appears that the Bush administration utilized  the attacks as a pretext to justify military action, linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This disconnect between stated justifications and reality deeply troubles me. The administration's actions seem to demonstrate a blatant disregard for truthfulness and transparency with the American people.\n\nColin Powell's subsequent admission that he harbored doubts about the evidence presented at the UN further reinforces this concern.  To mislead the nation on such a momentous occasion is, in my view, a grave offense, bordering on impeachable.  \n\nThere's a pervasive feeling that the Bush administration's approach towards the Constitution has been one of erosion since September 11th.  It's been suggested, albeit by those outside the administration, that their ambition from the outset included military intervention.  \n\nThe motivations behind the war remain complex and multifaceted.  One theory posits a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from the previous administration's dealings with Iraq.  Another proposes an underlying desire to secure American energy interests in the region, a strategy I find deeply problematic. \n\nThe duration of the conflict has undeniably caused immense suffering, and a hasty withdrawal could exacerbate the situation by triggering civil strife and further bloodshed.  The current plan, involving a coalition of neighboring nations, presents its own set of challenges.  It raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and the potential for long-term instability. \n\nThe interim government's fragility is evident, with the Parliament seemingly ineffective and the Prime Minister lacking substantial control. The presence of powerful factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party further complicates the political landscape, creating a volatile environment rife with internal conflict.",
            "The ongoing conflict in Iraq presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivation for intervention, I believe the current situation lacks a clear purpose. The absence of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about the legitimacy of our involvement. \n\nThe stated goals of fostering democracy and securing energy resources seem at odds with the reality on the ground.  Attempts to impose our political system on a culture vastly different from our own risk exacerbating tensions and fostering resentment.  The potential for long-term instability and the erosion of our national image as a result of continued involvement are significant concerns. \n\nFurthermore, the human cost of this protracted conflict is undeniable. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are at stake. It's essential to consider the well-being of all parties involved and explore alternative paths to a peaceful resolution.",
            "The issue of legalization presents a complex dilemma, especially considering the foundational principles of the United States. I firmly believe that the Constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state should serve as a guiding principle in this matter. The document explicitly outlines this separation, and any attempt to legislate on this issue would, in my view, constitute a direct challenge to this established tenet. \n\nFurthermore, imposing legal restrictions on a practice that is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs raises serious concerns about the government's overreach.  Different religious communities hold diverse perspectives on this matter, and attempting to codify one specific belief system into law would inevitably disadvantage others. \n\nThe Constitution has long been lauded for promoting religious tolerance, and enacting an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very foundation.  It's crucial to remember that the Constitution's purpose is primarily to safeguard individual liberties and limit government power.  An amendment aimed at restricting individual choices rather than government actions would be a significant departure from this principle.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the government should abstain from interfering in this domain.  It is not the role of the state to dictate the internal practices of religious institutions.  Ultimately, the decision should rest with individual religious communities, guided by their own doctrines and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  While the initial justification for the invasion centered around concerns about weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism, many believe the true motives were more multifaceted.  \n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that the government's portrayal of the conflict to the American public was not entirely transparent.  The emotional fallout from the September 11th attacks was undoubtedly exploited to garner public support for the war, potentially overshadowing a more nuanced understanding of the situation. \n\nPersonally, I hold reservations about preemptive military action in general.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the historical mistakes made during the Vietnam War, highlighting the dangers of underestimating the complexities of foreign intervention.  \n\nThe high number of American casualties is a tragic consequence of the conflict, and the long-term ramifications of the removal of the Iraqi government have proven to be far-reaching and difficult to predict.\n\nThe United States' attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a challenging endeavor, mirroring the difficulties encountered during the Vietnam War.  The complexities of nation-building and the inherent resistance to foreign influence often lead to protracted and costly conflicts.\n\nThe war has raised important ethical questions about the role of the United States in global affairs.  The decision to intervene militarily should not be taken lightly, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences, both short-term and long-term, is essential.\n\nI believe that a more thorough and transparent approach to foreign policy is crucial, one that prioritizes diplomacy and international cooperation whenever possible.  The Iraq War serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for careful consideration before resorting to military force.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage is clear: I wholeheartedly support it.  This belief stems from a fundamental understanding that personal preferences, particularly regarding relationships, should be respected and protected.  \n\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests a biological basis for sexual orientation, further emphasizing the argument against restricting rights based on something beyond an individual's control. Denying individuals equal rights due to their inherent nature is, in my view, deeply inhumane.  I've always been a vocal advocate for marriage equality.\n\nPolitics and government should not dictate personal choices like marriage. It's a matter of individual and familial autonomy, not a public issue.  Even in my own neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who, despite not being legally recognized, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They contribute to their community, raise children, and deserve the same legal recognition and protections.  \n\nWhen public figures attempt to impose their own interpretations of marriage, it feels intrusive and dismissive of the lived experiences of countless individuals.  \n\nResearch increasingly points to a biological predisposition for sexual orientation. It's not a choice, and it's not a result of sociological factors. This biological basis further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nMarriage, at its core, is a personal commitment. While heterosexual couples can easily choose to marry discreetly, the same isn't true for same-sex couples.  Their decisions are often subject to public scrutiny and debate, highlighting the need for greater acceptance and legal equality.  Marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle subject to political and social agendas.",
            "The digital landscape presents unique challenges regarding privacy and responsibility.  Once information is shared online, it enters the public sphere and can significantly influence how others perceive an individual. This raises important questions about the consequences of our digital footprints. \n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts, even those intended as jokes, have been misinterpreted and raised concerns.  The internet's wide reach means that information can quickly spread beyond the intended audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, in particular, face the difficult task of balancing the need to protect students with the right to free expression.  While it's crucial to prevent potential harm, it's equally important to respect students' privacy.  \n\nA delicate line exists between monitoring for safety concerns and overstepping boundaries.  While schools may be obligated to investigate credible threats, it's essential to avoid intrusive surveillance practices.  Open communication and trust between students and school officials are vital in navigating these complex issues.  \n\nUltimately, individuals bear responsibility for the content they share online.  Before posting, it's important to consider the potential impact on oneself and others.  The internet offers a powerful platform for connection and expression, but it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial intention, to establish democracy in a nation lacking democratic principles, seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. \n\nIt feels as though the conflict has evolved into a demonstration of power, rather than a genuine effort to promote democracy. Concerns exist regarding the motivations behind the war's initiation, particularly potential connections to past disputes between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the primary objective was indeed to bring democracy to a country lacking political fairness, that would be a justifiable reason. However, any personal agendas involved would undoubtedly undermine the ethical foundation of the war.\n\nDespite the initial impact and statement made in the early months, the prolonged nature of the conflict—spanning several years—is deeply troubling. It appears that the war has become self-perpetuating, with the focus shifting from achieving a clear objective to simply continuing the fight, seeking a decisive victory.\n\nThe war's extended duration has become detrimental.  The country's government and its people must eventually be responsible for their own governance. We've reached a point where our continued involvement is draining our own economy, diverting resources from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Billions are being spent on a conflict that no longer serves its original purpose. \n\nIt's crucial to prioritize domestic needs and allocate resources effectively. The ongoing war diverts essential funds from vital areas that require immediate attention.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one.  While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, there are still ethical considerations.  For instance, while users choose to share information, it's unsettling to think that someone could misuse that information, especially to harm others.  \n\nThere's a fine line between responsible monitoring and unwarranted intrusion.  It's difficult to imagine a school system effectively monitoring student activity on social media without crossing that line.  Such a system could easily lead to unfair targeting and discrimination.  \n\nHowever, the potential for harm is real.  I've personally experienced the unsettling feeling of strangers contacting me on platforms like Facebook, knowing personal details about me that I hadn't publicly shared. It highlights the vulnerability of online information and the need for caution.\n\nThe issue of schools banning social media use by students raises questions about freedom of expression and the role of technology in education.  While I understand the potential dangers, I believe outright bans might not be the most effective solution.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach, focusing on digital literacy and responsible online behavior, would be more beneficial.",
            "The Iraq War has been a deeply complex issue, and my perspective on it has evolved over time. While I understand the initial justifications for the intervention, the ongoing situation has raised serious concerns.  \n\nPublic opinion, both domestically and internationally, has consistently indicated widespread disapproval of the war's conduct and its lasting consequences. Polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and individuals globally believe the war was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, advocating for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe war's impact has been undeniably devastating, exacerbating existing tensions and instability in the region.  The cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East make it challenging to impose solutions from the outside. Attempts to establish democracy in a region with deeply entrenched traditions and power structures have proven to be deeply problematic.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been based on a thorough assessment of the potential ramifications. The consequences, both immediate and long-term, have been far-reaching and have created a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe possibility of a complete withdrawal from Iraq remains a contentious topic. While I recognize the complexities involved, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the voices of the Iraqi people. Their desire for self-determination and their calls for our departure should be seriously considered.  \n\nA gradual withdrawal, conducted responsibly and in consultation with Iraqi leaders, might be a more palatable option. However, the urgency for a definitive exit strategy is undeniable.  The consequences of prolonged military involvement continue to weigh heavily on both Iraq and the United States.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it often manifests differently depending on the field and societal expectations. While progress has been made towards gender equality, certain industries and roles continue to exhibit biases.\n\n For example, women frequently encounter a \"glass ceiling\" where, despite qualifications, they may face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to historical gender roles and societal perceptions. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children often encounter prejudice and societal pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms.\n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where male designers may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable simply because they do not adhere to stereotypically masculine aesthetics. These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of gender discrimination, demonstrating how societal expectations and ingrained biases can impact individuals regardless of their gender.\n\nWhile change is gradual, the increasing representation of women in leadership roles and the growing acceptance of diverse family structures suggest that societal attitudes are evolving.  It is crucial to continue challenging these biases and promote inclusion in all aspects of society.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex, encompassing both legal and social implications.  \n\nDecriminalization, as opposed to full legalization, shifts the focus from criminal offenses to civil infractions. This means individuals caught with marijuana might face citations similar to traffic violations, rather than arrest and prosecution.  While this diminishes the immediate legal consequences, long-term ramifications like employment hurdles remain a concern.\n\nHowever, decriminalization presents financial benefits for municipalities. The costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration can be substantial. By diverting resources from marijuana enforcement, communities could potentially allocate funds towards essential services such as education, social programs, and homelessness support.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization gains traction in areas with more progressive social values, where financial considerations and a desire for social reform are prioritized. Denver, for example, has embraced decriminalization, potentially freeing up resources for community betterment.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential for increased marijuana use if legalized, mirroring the accessibility of cigarettes.  \n\nThe societal stigma surrounding marijuana use also persists, and widespread availability could lead to discomfort and awkwardness in certain contexts. \n\nUltimately, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, and its impact on individual lifestyles and decision-making is multifaceted.  A nuanced approach is essential when considering the legalization debate, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "While I respect the enduring traditions of the Catholic Church, I believe that maintaining relevance in a changing world requires adaptability. There are certain aspects of Catholicism, such as the emphasis on weekly church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine, that can feel exclusionary.  \n\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith marriage faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This experience highlighted a perceived contradiction between the Church's teachings of love and acceptance and its reluctance to embrace individuals from diverse religious backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, some Catholic practices seem outdated, particularly regarding the celibacy requirement for priests. While I support the idea of allowing priests to marry, I recognize that such a change might not necessarily address issues of misconduct. \n\nUltimately, I believe that the root causes of such problems lie beyond marital status and require multifaceted solutions. It's important to remember that individuals who engage in harmful acts, such as child abuse, often do so regardless of their personal circumstances.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage is undeniably complex, residing at the intersection of deeply held religious beliefs and the fundamental principles of individual liberty and equality. \n\nDetermining the appropriate legal framework for marriage presents a significant challenge. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, suggesting that the government should not dictate religious practices or doctrines. On the other hand, marriage has historically been recognized as a societal institution with legal and social implications, leading to questions about the role of government in defining and regulating it.\n\nSome argue that marriage should be solely a religious sacrament, while others believe it should be a civil contract governed by the state.  The potential for legal recognition of same-sex marriages raises concerns about the impact on religious freedom and traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIt's important to consider the diverse perspectives on this issue and engage in respectful dialogue to find a solution that balances the rights of all individuals.  While I believe that civil unions offer a viable alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, I acknowledge the strong emotional and personal significance that marriage holds for many. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage should be decided through a thoughtful and inclusive process that respects both individual liberties and the principles of equality.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my perspective on homosexuality. It's a complex issue for me, as I value my friendships with individuals who identify as gay. While I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle, I believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to determine its own laws regarding marriage. The United States is a diverse nation with varying political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states, for instance, are more likely to support same-sex marriage, reflecting the values of their constituents.  \n\nIndividuals choosing to reside in a particular state should respect the legal framework and social norms established by that state.  Conversely, I believe a national mandate on such a sensitive topic would be inappropriate, as it would disregard the diverse viewpoints and cultural contexts across the country.\n\nI firmly believe in equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Therefore, I support a state-by-state approach to legalization, allowing each community to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and accommodating society while respecting individual autonomy and local control.  \n\nThe current federal ban on gay marriage, in my opinion, oversteps the bounds of federal authority. It's a matter best left to the individual states to decide.  Furthermore, the political landscape is constantly evolving. A future administration with different priorities could potentially overturn this ban, leading to a back-and-forth situation.  \n\nA state-by-state approach allows for a more nuanced and enduring solution, empowering communities to shape their own destinies and create a more harmonious and just society.",
            "The concept of privacy in the digital age is complex. While MySpace, for instance, presents itself as a public platform, the expectation of complete visibility can be misleading. Individuals might not always anticipate the potential consequences of their online actions, especially when it comes to sensitive information.\n\nHowever, when considering the safety and security of students, the boundaries of privacy can become blurred. School officials, entrusted with the well-being of their students, have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent potential harm.\n\nIf accessing social media platforms like MySpace serves as a tool to identify and address threats, it could be argued that the potential benefit outweighs the infringement on privacy.  The idea of schools monitoring student activity online is controversial, but the goal of creating a safe learning environment for all is paramount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact. Once information is shared online, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to fully remove it. This permanence necessitates careful consideration of the content we post and the potential consequences it could have on our future.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between individual privacy and collective safety is a delicate and ongoing challenge in our increasingly interconnected world.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I felt a surge of anger and a strong desire for retribution. I believed that military action against those responsible was necessary and justified. However, with time, I've come to question the wisdom of our involvement. \n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding 9/11 may have overshadowed a careful consideration of the long-term consequences. It seems we entered the conflict hastily, lacking a comprehensive plan and unprepared for the complexities of the situation. \n\nLooking back, I believe the intervention has ultimately been counterproductive. The ongoing conflict has fueled instability and division within the region, hindering any possibility of lasting peace. It's become increasingly clear that external intervention is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted issues at play. \n\nThe culture of war in that part of the world is vastly different from our own. Their methods are often brutal and their motivations complex, making it difficult to achieve our objectives through traditional means.  \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now believe that a more diplomatic approach would have been more effective. We should focus on fostering understanding and cooperation rather than resorting to military force.  \n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and divisive affair. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider a more sustainable path towards peace. We need to prioritize diplomacy and work towards building bridges rather than walls."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a challenge in retaining its members. I believe this decline is partly due to its stance on certain contemporary issues.  \n\nWhile the Church holds strong, traditional views on topics like marriage equality, abortion, and contraception, these positions may not resonate with a modern audience.  \n\nMany individuals find the Church's perspective on these matters outdated and, consequently, feel alienated.  They seek a faith community that aligns with their own beliefs and values.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a church that vehemently opposes it. Similarly, someone who advocates for same-sex marriage might not find a welcoming environment in a Church that does not. \n\nPerhaps the Church could benefit from a more inclusive and adaptable approach to these complex issues. Embracing a wider range of perspectives might help bridge the gap and attract new generations of believers.  \n\nThe Church's assertion that priests are \"married to God\" and devote their lives solely to their ministry doesn't seem to adequately account for the human experience of wanting both a spiritual calling and a personal life.  Allowing priests to marry could potentially address this perceived disconnect and offer a more relatable model for aspiring clergy.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a conscious decision, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people responsible for something they are born with. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that a man and a woman's union is inherently different or superior.\n\nWhile I haven't extensively studied the legal and societal implications of same-sex marriage, I strongly feel that it's a matter of personal liberty and should be respected.  \n\nPerhaps the government's role shouldn't extend to regulating personal relationships, especially those that don't infringe upon the rights or well-being of others.  It seems to me that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and given the same opportunities for happiness and commitment as heterosexual couples.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness. Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions about same-sex relationships.  It's crucial to recognize that the dynamics within a committed partnership, regardless of sexual orientation, share many commonalities. \n\nOpponents sometimes cite concerns about societal impacts, particularly regarding children raised by same-sex couples. However, extensive research indicates that children thrive in loving and supportive environments, and the parenting styles of same-sex couples are demonstrably comparable to those of heterosexual couples.  \n\nThe issue of marriage equality transcends religious beliefs and delves into the realm of civil rights. Access to legal recognition and the benefits associated with marriage, such as healthcare and property rights, should be extended equally to all committed couples. \n\nAdvocating for a government-sanctioned distinction between different types of relationships is akin to segregation, perpetuating inequality under the guise of differing moral viewpoints.\n\nWhile personal beliefs are important, imposing them on an entire nation through legal means is both unethical and inconsistent with the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. The government should uphold the rights of all its citizens, ensuring that legal frameworks reflect the values of equality and justice.",
            "The experience I gained working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer truly shaped my perspective on drug legality. While I understand the concerns surrounding the illicit status of certain substances, I believe the classification of a drug as illegal shouldn't automatically preclude its potential medicinal benefits. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, that are legally prescribed and utilized in pharmacies for their therapeutic value.  Denying the potential benefits of marijuana simply because of societal stigma seems illogical to me.  We should prioritize exploring its medicinal applications rather than dismissing them outright.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol presents a complex dilemma. Both substances can be misused, leading to negative consequences. However, I believe a measured approach is necessary.  Gradually integrating marijuana into legal frameworks, rather than a sudden legalization, might mitigate potential abuse while allowing for responsible use.  \n\nThe negative public perception surrounding marijuana stems largely from its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that marijuana's potential for harm pales in comparison to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By challenging the misconception of marijuana as inherently dangerous, we can create an environment where its responsible use, particularly for medical purposes, is more readily accepted.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to suit the modern world. It's not as rigid as it once was. Looking back, when I was younger, every Sunday was a big event. I'd put on my best attire – a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse to complete the look. That was the norm for me, especially since I attended a private school where I saw my friends every weekend. We'd all gather at church.\n\nNow, things have changed.  They've introduced a special mass for teenagers, keeping it concise at thirty minutes.  People dress much more casually, especially during summer. It's common to see people in beach attire, straight from the shore. You'll even find families rushing in late.  \n\nEven at the traditional morning masses, where I used to be meticulous about my appearance, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. While khakis are perfectly acceptable, the overall trend leans towards casual wear. \n\nPersonally, this shift in attire is the most noticeable change I've observed. As for other aspects of the church, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. I'm not deeply involved in the church's politics, but these changes are evident in my experience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests, I believe these issues are complex and deeply rooted.  \n\nI don't think simply allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have prevented these occurrences.  After all, pedophilia can affect anyone, regardless of marital status. It's a deeply personal struggle, and I believe it stems from individual factors rather than religious rules.  \n\nIt's important to remember that becoming a priest is a personal choice. Other religions allow for married clergy, such as the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both a religious calling and marriage, they might consider exploring those options.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War held some appeal, but the aftermath of September 11th cast a long shadow over the decision-making process. It appears that the Bush administration utilized  the attacks as a pretext to justify military action, linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This disconnect between stated justifications and reality deeply troubles me. The administration's actions seem to demonstrate a blatant disregard for truthfulness and transparency with the American people.\n\nColin Powell's subsequent admission that he harbored doubts about the evidence presented at the UN further reinforces this concern.  To mislead the nation on such a momentous occasion is, in my view, a grave offense, bordering on impeachable.  \n\nThere's a pervasive feeling that the Bush administration's approach towards the Constitution has been one of erosion since September 11th.  It's been suggested, albeit by those outside the administration, that their ambition from the outset included military intervention.  \n\nThe motivations behind the war remain complex and multifaceted.  One theory posits a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from the previous administration's dealings with Iraq.  Another proposes an underlying desire to secure American energy interests in the region, a strategy I find deeply problematic. \n\nThe duration of the conflict has undeniably caused immense suffering, and a hasty withdrawal could exacerbate the situation by triggering civil strife and further bloodshed.  The current plan, involving a coalition of neighboring nations, presents its own set of challenges.  It raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and the potential for long-term instability. \n\nThe interim government's fragility is evident, with the Parliament seemingly ineffective and the Prime Minister lacking substantial control. The presence of powerful factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party further complicates the political landscape, creating a volatile environment rife with internal conflict.",
            "The ongoing conflict in Iraq presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivation for intervention, I believe the current situation lacks a clear purpose. The absence of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about the legitimacy of our involvement. \n\nThe stated goals of fostering democracy and securing energy resources seem at odds with the reality on the ground.  Attempts to impose our political system on a culture vastly different from our own risk exacerbating tensions and fostering resentment.  The potential for long-term instability and the erosion of our national image as a result of continued involvement are significant concerns. \n\nFurthermore, the human cost of this protracted conflict is undeniable. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are at stake. It's essential to consider the well-being of all parties involved and explore alternative paths to a peaceful resolution.",
            "The issue of legalization presents a complex dilemma, especially considering the foundational principles of the United States. I firmly believe that the Constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state should serve as a guiding principle in this matter. The document explicitly outlines this separation, and any attempt to legislate on this issue would, in my view, constitute a direct challenge to this established tenet. \n\nFurthermore, imposing legal restrictions on a practice that is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs raises serious concerns about the government's overreach.  Different religious communities hold diverse perspectives on this matter, and attempting to codify one specific belief system into law would inevitably disadvantage others. \n\nThe Constitution has long been lauded for promoting religious tolerance, and enacting an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very foundation.  It's crucial to remember that the Constitution's purpose is primarily to safeguard individual liberties and limit government power.  An amendment aimed at restricting individual choices rather than government actions would be a significant departure from this principle.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the government should abstain from interfering in this domain.  It is not the role of the state to dictate the internal practices of religious institutions.  Ultimately, the decision should rest with individual religious communities, guided by their own doctrines and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  While the initial justification for the invasion centered around concerns about weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism, many believe the true motives were more multifaceted.  \n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that the government's portrayal of the conflict to the American public was not entirely transparent.  The emotional fallout from the September 11th attacks was undoubtedly exploited to garner public support for the war, potentially overshadowing a more nuanced understanding of the situation. \n\nPersonally, I hold reservations about preemptive military action in general.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the historical mistakes made during the Vietnam War, highlighting the dangers of underestimating the complexities of foreign intervention.  \n\nThe high number of American casualties is a tragic consequence of the conflict, and the long-term ramifications of the removal of the Iraqi government have proven to be far-reaching and difficult to predict.\n\nThe United States' attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a challenging endeavor, mirroring the difficulties encountered during the Vietnam War.  The complexities of nation-building and the inherent resistance to foreign influence often lead to protracted and costly conflicts.\n\nThe war has raised important ethical questions about the role of the United States in global affairs.  The decision to intervene militarily should not be taken lightly, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences, both short-term and long-term, is essential.\n\nI believe that a more thorough and transparent approach to foreign policy is crucial, one that prioritizes diplomacy and international cooperation whenever possible.  The Iraq War serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for careful consideration before resorting to military force.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage is clear: I wholeheartedly support it.  This belief stems from a fundamental understanding that personal preferences, particularly regarding relationships, should be respected and protected.  \n\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests a biological basis for sexual orientation, further emphasizing the argument against restricting rights based on something beyond an individual's control. Denying individuals equal rights due to their inherent nature is, in my view, deeply inhumane.  I've always been a vocal advocate for marriage equality.\n\nPolitics and government should not dictate personal choices like marriage. It's a matter of individual and familial autonomy, not a public issue.  Even in my own neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who, despite not being legally recognized, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They contribute to their community, raise children, and deserve the same legal recognition and protections.  \n\nWhen public figures attempt to impose their own interpretations of marriage, it feels intrusive and dismissive of the lived experiences of countless individuals.  \n\nResearch increasingly points to a biological predisposition for sexual orientation. It's not a choice, and it's not a result of sociological factors. This biological basis further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nMarriage, at its core, is a personal commitment. While heterosexual couples can easily choose to marry discreetly, the same isn't true for same-sex couples.  Their decisions are often subject to public scrutiny and debate, highlighting the need for greater acceptance and legal equality.  Marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle subject to political and social agendas.",
            "The digital landscape presents unique challenges regarding privacy and responsibility.  Once information is shared online, it enters the public sphere and can significantly influence how others perceive an individual. This raises important questions about the consequences of our digital footprints. \n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts, even those intended as jokes, have been misinterpreted and raised concerns.  The internet's wide reach means that information can quickly spread beyond the intended audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, in particular, face the difficult task of balancing the need to protect students with the right to free expression.  While it's crucial to prevent potential harm, it's equally important to respect students' privacy.  \n\nA delicate line exists between monitoring for safety concerns and overstepping boundaries.  While schools may be obligated to investigate credible threats, it's essential to avoid intrusive surveillance practices.  Open communication and trust between students and school officials are vital in navigating these complex issues.  \n\nUltimately, individuals bear responsibility for the content they share online.  Before posting, it's important to consider the potential impact on oneself and others.  The internet offers a powerful platform for connection and expression, but it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial intention, to establish democracy in a nation lacking democratic principles, seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. \n\nIt feels as though the conflict has evolved into a demonstration of power, rather than a genuine effort to promote democracy. Concerns exist regarding the motivations behind the war's initiation, particularly potential connections to past disputes between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the primary objective was indeed to bring democracy to a country lacking political fairness, that would be a justifiable reason. However, any personal agendas involved would undoubtedly undermine the ethical foundation of the war.\n\nDespite the initial impact and statement made in the early months, the prolonged nature of the conflict—spanning several years—is deeply troubling. It appears that the war has become self-perpetuating, with the focus shifting from achieving a clear objective to simply continuing the fight, seeking a decisive victory.\n\nThe war's extended duration has become detrimental.  The country's government and its people must eventually be responsible for their own governance. We've reached a point where our continued involvement is draining our own economy, diverting resources from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Billions are being spent on a conflict that no longer serves its original purpose. \n\nIt's crucial to prioritize domestic needs and allocate resources effectively. The ongoing war diverts essential funds from vital areas that require immediate attention.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one.  While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, there are still ethical considerations.  For instance, while users choose to share information, it's unsettling to think that someone could misuse that information, especially to harm others.  \n\nThere's a fine line between responsible monitoring and unwarranted intrusion.  It's difficult to imagine a school system effectively monitoring student activity on social media without crossing that line.  Such a system could easily lead to unfair targeting and discrimination.  \n\nHowever, the potential for harm is real.  I've personally experienced the unsettling feeling of strangers contacting me on platforms like Facebook, knowing personal details about me that I hadn't publicly shared. It highlights the vulnerability of online information and the need for caution.\n\nThe issue of schools banning social media use by students raises questions about freedom of expression and the role of technology in education.  While I understand the potential dangers, I believe outright bans might not be the most effective solution.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach, focusing on digital literacy and responsible online behavior, would be more beneficial.",
            "The Iraq War has been a deeply complex issue, and my perspective on it has evolved over time. While I understand the initial justifications for the intervention, the ongoing situation has raised serious concerns.  \n\nPublic opinion, both domestically and internationally, has consistently indicated widespread disapproval of the war's conduct and its lasting consequences. Polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and individuals globally believe the war was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, advocating for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe war's impact has been undeniably devastating, exacerbating existing tensions and instability in the region.  The cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East make it challenging to impose solutions from the outside. Attempts to establish democracy in a region with deeply entrenched traditions and power structures have proven to be deeply problematic.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been based on a thorough assessment of the potential ramifications. The consequences, both immediate and long-term, have been far-reaching and have created a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe possibility of a complete withdrawal from Iraq remains a contentious topic. While I recognize the complexities involved, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the voices of the Iraqi people. Their desire for self-determination and their calls for our departure should be seriously considered.  \n\nA gradual withdrawal, conducted responsibly and in consultation with Iraqi leaders, might be a more palatable option. However, the urgency for a definitive exit strategy is undeniable.  The consequences of prolonged military involvement continue to weigh heavily on both Iraq and the United States.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it often manifests differently depending on the field and societal expectations. While progress has been made towards gender equality, certain industries and roles continue to exhibit biases.\n\n For example, women frequently encounter a \"glass ceiling\" where, despite qualifications, they may face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to historical gender roles and societal perceptions. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children often encounter prejudice and societal pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms.\n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where male designers may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable simply because they do not adhere to stereotypically masculine aesthetics. These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of gender discrimination, demonstrating how societal expectations and ingrained biases can impact individuals regardless of their gender.\n\nWhile change is gradual, the increasing representation of women in leadership roles and the growing acceptance of diverse family structures suggest that societal attitudes are evolving.  It is crucial to continue challenging these biases and promote inclusion in all aspects of society.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex, encompassing both legal and social implications.  \n\nDecriminalization, as opposed to full legalization, shifts the focus from criminal offenses to civil infractions. This means individuals caught with marijuana might face citations similar to traffic violations, rather than arrest and prosecution.  While this diminishes the immediate legal consequences, long-term ramifications like employment hurdles remain a concern.\n\nHowever, decriminalization presents financial benefits for municipalities. The costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration can be substantial. By diverting resources from marijuana enforcement, communities could potentially allocate funds towards essential services such as education, social programs, and homelessness support.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization gains traction in areas with more progressive social values, where financial considerations and a desire for social reform are prioritized. Denver, for example, has embraced decriminalization, potentially freeing up resources for community betterment.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential for increased marijuana use if legalized, mirroring the accessibility of cigarettes.  \n\nThe societal stigma surrounding marijuana use also persists, and widespread availability could lead to discomfort and awkwardness in certain contexts. \n\nUltimately, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, and its impact on individual lifestyles and decision-making is multifaceted.  A nuanced approach is essential when considering the legalization debate, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "While I respect the enduring traditions of the Catholic Church, I believe that maintaining relevance in a changing world requires adaptability. There are certain aspects of Catholicism, such as the emphasis on weekly church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine, that can feel exclusionary.  \n\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith marriage faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This experience highlighted a perceived contradiction between the Church's teachings of love and acceptance and its reluctance to embrace individuals from diverse religious backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, some Catholic practices seem outdated, particularly regarding the celibacy requirement for priests. While I support the idea of allowing priests to marry, I recognize that such a change might not necessarily address issues of misconduct. \n\nUltimately, I believe that the root causes of such problems lie beyond marital status and require multifaceted solutions. It's important to remember that individuals who engage in harmful acts, such as child abuse, often do so regardless of their personal circumstances.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage is undeniably complex, residing at the intersection of deeply held religious beliefs and the fundamental principles of individual liberty and equality. \n\nDetermining the appropriate legal framework for marriage presents a significant challenge. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, suggesting that the government should not dictate religious practices or doctrines. On the other hand, marriage has historically been recognized as a societal institution with legal and social implications, leading to questions about the role of government in defining and regulating it.\n\nSome argue that marriage should be solely a religious sacrament, while others believe it should be a civil contract governed by the state.  The potential for legal recognition of same-sex marriages raises concerns about the impact on religious freedom and traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIt's important to consider the diverse perspectives on this issue and engage in respectful dialogue to find a solution that balances the rights of all individuals.  While I believe that civil unions offer a viable alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, I acknowledge the strong emotional and personal significance that marriage holds for many. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage should be decided through a thoughtful and inclusive process that respects both individual liberties and the principles of equality.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my perspective on homosexuality. It's a complex issue for me, as I value my friendships with individuals who identify as gay. While I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle, I believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to determine its own laws regarding marriage. The United States is a diverse nation with varying political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states, for instance, are more likely to support same-sex marriage, reflecting the values of their constituents.  \n\nIndividuals choosing to reside in a particular state should respect the legal framework and social norms established by that state.  Conversely, I believe a national mandate on such a sensitive topic would be inappropriate, as it would disregard the diverse viewpoints and cultural contexts across the country.\n\nI firmly believe in equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Therefore, I support a state-by-state approach to legalization, allowing each community to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and accommodating society while respecting individual autonomy and local control.  \n\nThe current federal ban on gay marriage, in my opinion, oversteps the bounds of federal authority. It's a matter best left to the individual states to decide.  Furthermore, the political landscape is constantly evolving. A future administration with different priorities could potentially overturn this ban, leading to a back-and-forth situation.  \n\nA state-by-state approach allows for a more nuanced and enduring solution, empowering communities to shape their own destinies and create a more harmonious and just society.",
            "The concept of privacy in the digital age is complex. While MySpace, for instance, presents itself as a public platform, the expectation of complete visibility can be misleading. Individuals might not always anticipate the potential consequences of their online actions, especially when it comes to sensitive information.\n\nHowever, when considering the safety and security of students, the boundaries of privacy can become blurred. School officials, entrusted with the well-being of their students, have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent potential harm.\n\nIf accessing social media platforms like MySpace serves as a tool to identify and address threats, it could be argued that the potential benefit outweighs the infringement on privacy.  The idea of schools monitoring student activity online is controversial, but the goal of creating a safe learning environment for all is paramount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact. Once information is shared online, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to fully remove it. This permanence necessitates careful consideration of the content we post and the potential consequences it could have on our future.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between individual privacy and collective safety is a delicate and ongoing challenge in our increasingly interconnected world.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I felt a surge of anger and a strong desire for retribution. I believed that military action against those responsible was necessary and justified. However, with time, I've come to question the wisdom of our involvement. \n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding 9/11 may have overshadowed a careful consideration of the long-term consequences. It seems we entered the conflict hastily, lacking a comprehensive plan and unprepared for the complexities of the situation. \n\nLooking back, I believe the intervention has ultimately been counterproductive. The ongoing conflict has fueled instability and division within the region, hindering any possibility of lasting peace. It's become increasingly clear that external intervention is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted issues at play. \n\nThe culture of war in that part of the world is vastly different from our own. Their methods are often brutal and their motivations complex, making it difficult to achieve our objectives through traditional means.  \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now believe that a more diplomatic approach would have been more effective. We should focus on fostering understanding and cooperation rather than resorting to military force.  \n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and divisive affair. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider a more sustainable path towards peace. We need to prioritize diplomacy and work towards building bridges rather than walls."
