            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It's my opinion that the Catholic Church could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. There's been discussion about the Church losing members, and I believe this decline may be partly due to its lack of inclusivity on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.\n\nWhile the Church has strong convictions on these topics, which is understandable, some of its views seem outdated in today's society. If the Church were to embrace a more contemporary perspective, it might see a renewed sense of engagement from its followers. \n\nI've heard concerns from individuals who are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these sensitive subjects.  People are increasingly seeking a faith community that aligns with their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFor example, a person who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's condemned, or someone who believes in same-sex marriage might feel alienated by the Church's opposition. \n\nI personally think allowing female priests and permitting married priests would be positive changes. However, it's difficult to say definitively if these reforms would have prevented past scandals.  \n\nThe Church's doctrine states that priests are dedicated to God, but I see no reason why they couldn't also have fulfilling family lives. Most people in the world balance their professional commitments with their personal relationships, and I believe priests should have that same opportunity.",
            "I believe that everyone should have the right to marry, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice; people are born with certain inclinations.  Therefore, it seems unfair to deny someone the right to marry simply because of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't deeply explored the legal and philosophical complexities of same-sex marriage, I firmly believe that government shouldn't dictate who can and cannot marry.  Marriage is a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring equal rights and protections for all citizens.  \n\nUltimately,  it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and that includes recognizing the fundamental right to love and commit to another person.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a topic that demands careful consideration.  While some argue that allowing gay couples to marry threatens the traditional family structure, this perspective overlooks the fundamental differences between relationships and the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and commitment.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not solely a religious institution.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry based on religious beliefs raises concerns about the separation of church and state.  If civil unions are accepted, extending the full legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples seems like a logical and equitable step. \n\nThere are compelling arguments supporting this position.  Scientific research has shown that same-sex relationships exhibit similar patterns of success and satisfaction as heterosexual relationships.  Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry can have serious consequences for their families and well-being.  For instance, in healthcare settings, legal partners may be denied visitation rights, highlighting the importance of legal recognition for these relationships. \n\nConcerns regarding the impact of same-sex parents on their children have also been raised.  However, evidence suggests that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  It is essential to base our understanding on factual data rather than unfounded prejudices.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness.  Treating all individuals and couples with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, is fundamental to a just and inclusive society.  It is time to move beyond outdated notions and embrace a more equitable future where all couples have the right to legal recognition and the same benefits and protections.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer gave me a unique perspective on the legality versus medicinal value of certain substances. Observing firsthand how controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used responsibly for their therapeutic benefits made me consider the double standard surrounding marijuana. \n\nWhile I understand the concerns regarding public accessibility, I believe restricting its use solely based on its legal status is misguided. \n\nJust because a substance is illegal doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal properties.  Many substances with proven medical benefits have faced legal challenges in the past.  \n\nIt's crucial to approach this issue with a balanced perspective.  While acknowledging the potential for abuse, we should also recognize the potential benefits of marijuana for medical purposes.  Perhaps a gradual integration, similar to the controlled distribution of other pharmaceuticals, could mitigate concerns while allowing for responsible use.\n\nThe negative stigma associated with marijuana often overshadows its potential benefits.  Similar to alcohol, which can be harmful if abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, could be a valuable tool in managing certain medical conditions.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that by removing the taboo surrounding marijuana and fostering open, informed discussions, we can create a more nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and risks.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has definitely adapted to the modern era. It's certainly less rigid than it once was.  I can personally recall my childhood, attending church every Sunday in my Sunday best - complete with a matching dress, shoes, and purse. It was a regular part of my life, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my friends there on the weekends.  \n\nHowever, things have changed.  As I've gotten older, the church has implemented a special Mass geared towards teenagers, cutting it down to a more manageable thirty minutes. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. It's not uncommon to see families arrive straight from the beach, still in their swimwear. Even at the morning Masses, where I used to always dress up, I now see people in jeans and khakis.  It's definitely become more relaxed.\n\nWhile I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this shift towards a more casual atmosphere is the most noticeable change I've observed.\n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I think it's a complex issue.  I don't believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these tragedies.  Pedophilia isn't limited to any one profession or circumstance.  \n\nIt's a deeply personal issue rooted in an individual's nature, and, unfortunately, some individuals may be predisposed to these harmful behaviors regardless of their marital status or religious calling.  There are religions that allow married clergy, but that doesn't mean those individuals are immune to these issues.   \n\nIf someone truly desires to practice their faith while also being married, they might consider exploring other denominations that allow for this.  It's ultimately a personal choice.\n\nI realize this is a sensitive topic, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers.  It's a tragedy that these events have occurred, and my hope is that the church will continue to address these issues with transparency and accountability.",
            "The initial concept, while not initially objectionable, was overshadowed by the lingering impact of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the lead-up to the Iraq War was marked by several justifications, some of which have since been proven inaccurate.  \n\nThe Bush administration's early connection of the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, along with the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, has deeply troubled me.  These claims, now demonstrably false, raise serious concerns about the administration's transparency with the American public.  \n\nEven prominent figures like Colin Powell, who delivered a significant presentation at the United Nations, have expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the time.  This, to me, constitutes a serious breach of public trust, potentially even an impeachable offense.  \n\nThere's a perception that the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards military action, as evidenced by the assertions made by former Treasury Secretary [Name redacted] in his book following his departure from office.  \n\nThe younger Bush seemed to carry a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, potentially stemming from his father's administration's dealings with Iraq.  Furthermore, the pursuit of expanded energy resources appears to have been a motivating factor, which is a highly questionable approach.  \n\nThe prolonged duration of the conflict necessitates a delicate withdrawal strategy.  An abrupt departure risks plunging the country into civil war, resulting in further casualties.  \n\nThe proposed solution involving a coalition of regional nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order raises its own concerns.  Long-term implications for Iraq's sovereignty are unclear, as the interim government appears to be disintegrating. \n\nThe Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the limited control exerted by the Prime Minister, whose name escapes me, contribute to a volatile political climate.  The rise of figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, who now holds significant parliamentary seats, further complicates the situation.  \n\nThe current political landscape is characterized by internal strife and a struggle for power among various factions.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivations behind the conflict, such as responding to the tragic events of September 11th, I question the continued necessity of our involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legal and ethical implications of our military presence. Furthermore, the stated goals of establishing democracy and securing oil resources seem to be at odds with the reality on the ground. \n\nThe process of building a stable democracy in Iraq is a long and challenging undertaking, and the current situation appears to be exacerbating existing divisions within the country. The potential for unintended consequences, such as fueling further instability and anti-American sentiment, is a serious concern.\n\nIt is essential to consider the human cost of this conflict, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The ongoing violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on Iraqi society, while the sacrifices made by our troops should not be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq, coupled with a renewed focus on diplomatic solutions, is the most responsible path forward. This would allow for a more peaceful resolution to the conflict and minimize further bloodshed.",
            "The issue of [mention the specific issue being discussed] presents a complex dilemma. My personal stance is grounded in the fundamental principle of separation of church and state, as enshrined in our Constitution. This separation is crucial to ensuring religious freedom and preventing the imposition of one religious viewpoint over others.  \n\nAttempting to legislate on this matter, particularly through an amendment, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of this core principle.  It would essentially grant the government the authority to dictate religious practices, which I believe is inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nFurthermore, such an action could be perceived as favoring certain religious beliefs over others, creating division and potentially undermining the very fabric of religious tolerance that our nation was founded upon. \n\nI believe the decision regarding [mention the specific issue] should remain within the purview of individual religious institutions, allowing for diverse interpretations and practices without government interference.",
            "The conflict in Iraq presents a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency, with attempts to link it to the September 11th attacks, despite their tenuous connection. This manipulation of public sentiment, fueled by the nation's grief and anger, ultimately led to the commencement of hostilities in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I hold a strong anti-war stance, particularly regarding preemptive strikes. The Iraqi conflict echoes historical precedents like the Vietnam War, highlighting the government's failure to learn from past mistakes. The immense loss of American lives, coupled with the unforeseen consequences of regime change, underscores the gravity of this situation.\n\nThe removal of the Iraqi government without a comprehensive plan for the ensuing power vacuum resulted in chaos and instability. The attempt to establish a democratic system in Iraq, reminiscent of the endeavors in Vietnam, proved to be a protracted and arduous process.   \n\nThe complexities of nation-building, as exemplified by our own nation's historical struggles, demonstrate that establishing a stable and prosperous democracy is a lengthy and challenging undertaking.  \n\nThe administration's portrayal of a swift and successful intervention proved to be overly optimistic. The prolonged conflict, with its ongoing American casualties and the continued training of Iraqi security forces, raises crucial questions about the feasibility and ethical implications of our involvement.\n\nThe imperative to fulfill our commitments to the Iraqi people while weighing the escalating human and financial costs presents a formidable dilemma. The lack of clarity regarding the original objectives and the ongoing presence of oil interests further complicate the situation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the stated reasons for intervention and the reality on the ground, particularly the absence of weapons of mass destruction as initially claimed, casts doubt on the government's transparency and decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, the path forward remains uncertain. My hope is for a swift and peaceful resolution that brings stability and prosperity to Iraq while minimizing further loss of life.",
            "I firmly support marriage equality. This has been a deeply held belief for me. I see it as a matter of personal choice, something increasingly understood to have biological roots rather than solely sociological influences. \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control feels profoundly wrong. It's inhumane to restrict someone's fundamental freedoms due to their sexual orientation. I've always advocated for equal rights for all, including the right to marry.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage should be a private matter, a decision made between individuals and their families. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live fulfilling lives, raising families and contributing to their community, even though they lack legal recognition.\n\nThe notion that any individual or institution, especially the government, should define or control who can marry is troubling. It's a matter of personal autonomy and should remain a private affair. \n\nScientific research increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis, potentially influenced by factors like genetics and brain chemistry. This further underscores the importance of respecting individual choices and recognizing that sexual orientation is not a choice.\n\nThe contrast between the ease with which heterosexual couples can marry and the societal scrutiny faced by same-sex couples highlights the inherent inequality. Marriage should be a universally accessible right, free from public interference and legal barriers. It should be a celebration of love and commitment, not a subject for political debate or societal judgment.",
            "The nature of the internet necessitates an understanding of its public accessibility.  Once information is shared online, it becomes broadly visible, potentially influencing others' perceptions. This reality carries significant implications, especially when discussing sensitive topics. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. Sharing potentially concerning content, such as threats or violent language, can lead to serious repercussions. While it's important to remember that not all online expressions are intended maliciously, the potential for misinterpretation exists.  \n\nSchool officials, tasked with ensuring student safety, must act upon credible threats, even if they originate from online platforms.  A recent incident at my school illustrates this point. A seemingly innocuous online post, when viewed in the context of other information, raised concerns about a student's intentions.  \n\nThe key takeaway is that online content, shared in public forums, carries a degree of permanence and visibility.  Individuals must be mindful of the potential impact of their online presence, understanding that what they share can be accessed and interpreted by a wide audience.  \n\nWhile I believe there are ethical boundaries regarding school officials' access to student online activity,  the safety and well-being of the student body must ultimately take precedence.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial aim of restoring democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. It feels as though we're now engaged in the conflict solely to project an image of global dominance.  \n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's inception.  The personal history between former President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein casts a shadow of doubt on the purely altruistic nature of the conflict. If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a nation in need, that would be a justifiable cause. However, the presence of any personal agendas would undermine the legitimacy of the war.\n\nDespite achieving a decisive initial impact with the war's commencement, the prolonged conflict, spanning several years, has become excessive.  \n\nThe notion of promoting democracy through military intervention initially seemed reasonable, but I fear that our objectives have become muddled and misplaced. It appears we are now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than focusing on the original goals. \n\nThis extended conflict has exacted a heavy toll on our economy. Billions of dollars are being poured into a war that seems to have lost its purpose, money that could be better allocated to addressing pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and public services. \n\nThe fact that we are sacrificing the lives of our citizens in a foreign land for a cause that has become increasingly unclear is deeply troubling. It's time to recognize that the war has run its course and to focus our resources on the needs of our own nation.",
            "The concept of privacy online is a complex one. While sharing information on platforms like Myspace might seem like making it public, there are nuances to consider. A user chooses who they allow to view their profile, essentially granting permission to those they deem \"friends.\" However, the vast reach of the internet means that even seemingly private information can be accessed by unintended parties. \n\nThe ethical implications of monitoring student profiles raise concerns about potential discrimination and the invasion of privacy. While the desire to ensure student safety is understandable, assigning someone the task of scrutinizing every profile seems impractical and potentially harmful. It's crucial to balance safety concerns with individual freedoms.\n\nPersonally, I've experienced the unsettling feeling of encountering strangers who seem to know an excessive amount about me through platforms like Facebook.  Stories of individuals exploiting online information for malicious purposes highlight the potential dangers. It's a constant struggle to maintain a balance between online connectivity and personal security.\n\nThe incident involving a high school banning Myspace usage is particularly thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions can regulate students' online activities. While the school might have had safety concerns, it's debatable whether outright bans are an effective or ethical solution. Ultimately, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online behavior are crucial for navigating the complexities of online privacy.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift towards the current realities and potential future outcomes. \n\nGlobal sentiment, as evidenced by numerous polls, overwhelmingly condemns the war.  A significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and even U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this view.  The war has demonstrably destabilized the region, and the prospect of withdrawal, while challenging, may be the least detrimental option. \n\nThe cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East create significant obstacles to achieving lasting peace and stability.  Democratization efforts, while well-intentioned, may be ill-suited to the region's unique context.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been meticulously weighed against the potential consequences, which have proven to be catastrophic. The current situation resembles quicksand, making any foreseeable resolution fraught with difficulty.\n\nA gradual withdrawal, spanning a year or slightly longer, might be more manageable than an immediate departure. However, the Iraqi people's desire for our withdrawal, as expressed in polls, should be seriously considered.  \n\nUltimately, the question remains: what path offers the best chance for a positive outcome, both for Iraq and for the United States? Perhaps the most ethical approach is to respect the Iraqi people's wishes and allow them to chart their own future, even if it means accepting the inherent risks involved.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, extending beyond the experiences of women. While strides have been made towards equality, certain industries and societal expectations continue to present challenges. \n\nFor instance, women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering obstacles in advancing to leadership positions despite possessing the necessary qualifications. This bias stems from historical perceptions of women's roles in the business world. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents may face societal disapproval, as traditional gender roles often associate financial provision with masculinity.\n\nMoreover, the fashion industry presents a unique dynamic where men's expertise may be questioned based on stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nUltimately, societal norms and ingrained biases contribute to these forms of discrimination. While progress has been made, dismantling these deeply rooted attitudes requires a continuous effort to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that discrimination can manifest in various forms, extending beyond gender to encompass factors such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with various perspectives. While some argue that decriminalization, which reduces it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, is a step in the right direction, others believe it doesn't address the underlying concerns. \n\nOne key argument for decriminalization is the financial burden associated with arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. This process can be costly for municipalities, especially those facing financial challenges. \n\nProponents of decriminalization also point out that it can free up resources for other essential services, such as public education, social programs, and support for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some remain opposed to decriminalization due to concerns about its potential impact on public health and safety. They worry that increased accessibility could lead to more widespread use, including driving under the influence, and contribute to societal norms that normalize marijuana use.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to decriminalize marijuana involves weighing various factors, including public health, safety, financial considerations, and ethical concerns. It's a multifaceted debate that requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of the potential consequences.",
            "I would agree that the Catholic Church has a strong foundation in tradition. The enduring nature of their practices speaks to their commitment to their beliefs. However, I also believe that any institution, especially one as influential as the Church, must be open to adapting to the changing world. \n\nThere are aspects of Catholic doctrine that I find problematic. The emphasis on strict adherence to rules and the judgment of those who do not perfectly conform can feel exclusionary. This is particularly evident in their stance on interfaith marriage, as exemplified by my parents' experience. My father was Episcopalian, and my mother, a devout Catholic, was denied a Church wedding. This lack of acceptance of other faiths seems to contradict the core teaching of love and compassion that is central to Catholicism.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the Church's resistance to change, particularly regarding issues like allowing priests to marry, is outdated and hinders their ability to connect with a modern audience. While I understand the concerns about potential abuses, I believe that personal choices and human nature are complex and cannot be solely attributed to marital status.  \n\nUltimately, I feel a disconnect between the ideals espoused by the Church and the practices that often contradict them.",
            "The issue of marriage equality presents a complex dilemma. Balancing the principles of separation of church and state with the social and legal recognition of different relationship structures is a delicate task.  \n\nDefining marriage, particularly in the context of same-sex unions, raises profound questions.  Should the government, which traditionally doesn't intervene in religious matters like baptism,  become involved in defining and regulating a civil union that has religious significance for some?  \n\nIt seems logical to view marriage as primarily a civil contract, recognizing the commitment between two individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't grant special tax benefits or legal status based on religious affiliation, it shouldn't differentiate between marital unions based on the religious ceremony.\n\nIf states can reach a consensus on a fair and equitable approach to marriage equality, then federal legislation should reflect those shared values.  However, amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems an extreme and unnecessary measure. While this issue is deeply important to many, it doesn't warrant such a drastic constitutional change.  The Constitution should be preserved for matters of fundamental rights and liberties, not for regulating social norms.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my perspective on homosexuality is complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully align with that lifestyle. However, I believe in the fundamental right for individuals to choose their own paths and advocate for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nI think this issue is best handled at the state level rather than imposed nationally.  The United States is diverse, with varying political leanings and societal values. Democratic-leaning states are likely to be more progressive on issues like same-sex marriage, while Republican-leaning states may hold different views. \n\nIndividuals choose where they reside, and I believe they should respect the laws and social norms of the state they call home. If a state legalizes gay marriage, those living there should accept that as the prevailing stance within their community.\n\nUltimately, I support equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nThe federal government should not dictate social policies that are best decided at the state level.  A president, even one with strong personal beliefs, shouldn't impose a national stance on such a sensitive and multifaceted issue.  The ideal solution is to allow each state to determine its own approach, fostering a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse viewpoints can be accommodated.",
            "School officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students.  While the concept of privacy is important,  it's crucial to weigh that against the potential for harm.  Social media platforms like MySpace, being publicly accessible, inherently carry the risk of content being viewed by anyone, including school officials.  \n\nIf school officials become aware of something on a student's profile that raises concerns about their safety or the safety of others, it's understandable why they would investigate.  Preventing tragedies like Columbine should be a top priority, and if accessing a student's public profile helps achieve that goal, it's a justifiable action.  \n\nIt's important to remember that actions online have consequences, just like actions in the real world.  Students should be mindful of what they share publicly, as it can have unintended repercussions.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I strongly supported military action in response to the attacks, fueled by a desire for retribution. Looking back, however, I believe the emotional climate at the time overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences.\n\nOur involvement in the conflict feels like a hasty decision, lacking a comprehensive plan and adequate preparation. I've come to believe that our presence has not achieved the desired results and may even have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe internal conflicts within the region seem to be a significant obstacle to stability. It's difficult to assess how our involvement truly contributes to progress when factions are deeply divided amongst themselves. \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now question whether military intervention was the most effective approach.\n\nThe realities of conflict in that region differ drastically from our own experiences.  What we perceive as progress may not align with the aspirations of the local population.  Perhaps a more diplomatic and collaborative strategy would have been more fruitful."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It's my opinion that the Catholic Church could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. There's been discussion about the Church losing members, and I believe this decline may be partly due to its lack of inclusivity on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.\n\nWhile the Church has strong convictions on these topics, which is understandable, some of its views seem outdated in today's society. If the Church were to embrace a more contemporary perspective, it might see a renewed sense of engagement from its followers. \n\nI've heard concerns from individuals who are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these sensitive subjects.  People are increasingly seeking a faith community that aligns with their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFor example, a person who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's condemned, or someone who believes in same-sex marriage might feel alienated by the Church's opposition. \n\nI personally think allowing female priests and permitting married priests would be positive changes. However, it's difficult to say definitively if these reforms would have prevented past scandals.  \n\nThe Church's doctrine states that priests are dedicated to God, but I see no reason why they couldn't also have fulfilling family lives. Most people in the world balance their professional commitments with their personal relationships, and I believe priests should have that same opportunity.",
            "I believe that everyone should have the right to marry, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice; people are born with certain inclinations.  Therefore, it seems unfair to deny someone the right to marry simply because of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't deeply explored the legal and philosophical complexities of same-sex marriage, I firmly believe that government shouldn't dictate who can and cannot marry.  Marriage is a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring equal rights and protections for all citizens.  \n\nUltimately,  it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and that includes recognizing the fundamental right to love and commit to another person.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a topic that demands careful consideration.  While some argue that allowing gay couples to marry threatens the traditional family structure, this perspective overlooks the fundamental differences between relationships and the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and commitment.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not solely a religious institution.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry based on religious beliefs raises concerns about the separation of church and state.  If civil unions are accepted, extending the full legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples seems like a logical and equitable step. \n\nThere are compelling arguments supporting this position.  Scientific research has shown that same-sex relationships exhibit similar patterns of success and satisfaction as heterosexual relationships.  Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry can have serious consequences for their families and well-being.  For instance, in healthcare settings, legal partners may be denied visitation rights, highlighting the importance of legal recognition for these relationships. \n\nConcerns regarding the impact of same-sex parents on their children have also been raised.  However, evidence suggests that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  It is essential to base our understanding on factual data rather than unfounded prejudices.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness.  Treating all individuals and couples with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, is fundamental to a just and inclusive society.  It is time to move beyond outdated notions and embrace a more equitable future where all couples have the right to legal recognition and the same benefits and protections.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer gave me a unique perspective on the legality versus medicinal value of certain substances. Observing firsthand how controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used responsibly for their therapeutic benefits made me consider the double standard surrounding marijuana. \n\nWhile I understand the concerns regarding public accessibility, I believe restricting its use solely based on its legal status is misguided. \n\nJust because a substance is illegal doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal properties.  Many substances with proven medical benefits have faced legal challenges in the past.  \n\nIt's crucial to approach this issue with a balanced perspective.  While acknowledging the potential for abuse, we should also recognize the potential benefits of marijuana for medical purposes.  Perhaps a gradual integration, similar to the controlled distribution of other pharmaceuticals, could mitigate concerns while allowing for responsible use.\n\nThe negative stigma associated with marijuana often overshadows its potential benefits.  Similar to alcohol, which can be harmful if abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, could be a valuable tool in managing certain medical conditions.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that by removing the taboo surrounding marijuana and fostering open, informed discussions, we can create a more nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and risks.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has definitely adapted to the modern era. It's certainly less rigid than it once was.  I can personally recall my childhood, attending church every Sunday in my Sunday best - complete with a matching dress, shoes, and purse. It was a regular part of my life, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my friends there on the weekends.  \n\nHowever, things have changed.  As I've gotten older, the church has implemented a special Mass geared towards teenagers, cutting it down to a more manageable thirty minutes. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. It's not uncommon to see families arrive straight from the beach, still in their swimwear. Even at the morning Masses, where I used to always dress up, I now see people in jeans and khakis.  It's definitely become more relaxed.\n\nWhile I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this shift towards a more casual atmosphere is the most noticeable change I've observed.\n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I think it's a complex issue.  I don't believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these tragedies.  Pedophilia isn't limited to any one profession or circumstance.  \n\nIt's a deeply personal issue rooted in an individual's nature, and, unfortunately, some individuals may be predisposed to these harmful behaviors regardless of their marital status or religious calling.  There are religions that allow married clergy, but that doesn't mean those individuals are immune to these issues.   \n\nIf someone truly desires to practice their faith while also being married, they might consider exploring other denominations that allow for this.  It's ultimately a personal choice.\n\nI realize this is a sensitive topic, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers.  It's a tragedy that these events have occurred, and my hope is that the church will continue to address these issues with transparency and accountability.",
            "The initial concept, while not initially objectionable, was overshadowed by the lingering impact of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the lead-up to the Iraq War was marked by several justifications, some of which have since been proven inaccurate.  \n\nThe Bush administration's early connection of the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, along with the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, has deeply troubled me.  These claims, now demonstrably false, raise serious concerns about the administration's transparency with the American public.  \n\nEven prominent figures like Colin Powell, who delivered a significant presentation at the United Nations, have expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the time.  This, to me, constitutes a serious breach of public trust, potentially even an impeachable offense.  \n\nThere's a perception that the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards military action, as evidenced by the assertions made by former Treasury Secretary [Name redacted] in his book following his departure from office.  \n\nThe younger Bush seemed to carry a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, potentially stemming from his father's administration's dealings with Iraq.  Furthermore, the pursuit of expanded energy resources appears to have been a motivating factor, which is a highly questionable approach.  \n\nThe prolonged duration of the conflict necessitates a delicate withdrawal strategy.  An abrupt departure risks plunging the country into civil war, resulting in further casualties.  \n\nThe proposed solution involving a coalition of regional nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order raises its own concerns.  Long-term implications for Iraq's sovereignty are unclear, as the interim government appears to be disintegrating. \n\nThe Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the limited control exerted by the Prime Minister, whose name escapes me, contribute to a volatile political climate.  The rise of figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, who now holds significant parliamentary seats, further complicates the situation.  \n\nThe current political landscape is characterized by internal strife and a struggle for power among various factions.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivations behind the conflict, such as responding to the tragic events of September 11th, I question the continued necessity of our involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legal and ethical implications of our military presence. Furthermore, the stated goals of establishing democracy and securing oil resources seem to be at odds with the reality on the ground. \n\nThe process of building a stable democracy in Iraq is a long and challenging undertaking, and the current situation appears to be exacerbating existing divisions within the country. The potential for unintended consequences, such as fueling further instability and anti-American sentiment, is a serious concern.\n\nIt is essential to consider the human cost of this conflict, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The ongoing violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on Iraqi society, while the sacrifices made by our troops should not be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq, coupled with a renewed focus on diplomatic solutions, is the most responsible path forward. This would allow for a more peaceful resolution to the conflict and minimize further bloodshed.",
            "The issue of [mention the specific issue being discussed] presents a complex dilemma. My personal stance is grounded in the fundamental principle of separation of church and state, as enshrined in our Constitution. This separation is crucial to ensuring religious freedom and preventing the imposition of one religious viewpoint over others.  \n\nAttempting to legislate on this matter, particularly through an amendment, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of this core principle.  It would essentially grant the government the authority to dictate religious practices, which I believe is inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nFurthermore, such an action could be perceived as favoring certain religious beliefs over others, creating division and potentially undermining the very fabric of religious tolerance that our nation was founded upon. \n\nI believe the decision regarding [mention the specific issue] should remain within the purview of individual religious institutions, allowing for diverse interpretations and practices without government interference.",
            "The conflict in Iraq presents a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency, with attempts to link it to the September 11th attacks, despite their tenuous connection. This manipulation of public sentiment, fueled by the nation's grief and anger, ultimately led to the commencement of hostilities in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I hold a strong anti-war stance, particularly regarding preemptive strikes. The Iraqi conflict echoes historical precedents like the Vietnam War, highlighting the government's failure to learn from past mistakes. The immense loss of American lives, coupled with the unforeseen consequences of regime change, underscores the gravity of this situation.\n\nThe removal of the Iraqi government without a comprehensive plan for the ensuing power vacuum resulted in chaos and instability. The attempt to establish a democratic system in Iraq, reminiscent of the endeavors in Vietnam, proved to be a protracted and arduous process.   \n\nThe complexities of nation-building, as exemplified by our own nation's historical struggles, demonstrate that establishing a stable and prosperous democracy is a lengthy and challenging undertaking.  \n\nThe administration's portrayal of a swift and successful intervention proved to be overly optimistic. The prolonged conflict, with its ongoing American casualties and the continued training of Iraqi security forces, raises crucial questions about the feasibility and ethical implications of our involvement.\n\nThe imperative to fulfill our commitments to the Iraqi people while weighing the escalating human and financial costs presents a formidable dilemma. The lack of clarity regarding the original objectives and the ongoing presence of oil interests further complicate the situation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the stated reasons for intervention and the reality on the ground, particularly the absence of weapons of mass destruction as initially claimed, casts doubt on the government's transparency and decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, the path forward remains uncertain. My hope is for a swift and peaceful resolution that brings stability and prosperity to Iraq while minimizing further loss of life.",
            "I firmly support marriage equality. This has been a deeply held belief for me. I see it as a matter of personal choice, something increasingly understood to have biological roots rather than solely sociological influences. \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control feels profoundly wrong. It's inhumane to restrict someone's fundamental freedoms due to their sexual orientation. I've always advocated for equal rights for all, including the right to marry.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage should be a private matter, a decision made between individuals and their families. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live fulfilling lives, raising families and contributing to their community, even though they lack legal recognition.\n\nThe notion that any individual or institution, especially the government, should define or control who can marry is troubling. It's a matter of personal autonomy and should remain a private affair. \n\nScientific research increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis, potentially influenced by factors like genetics and brain chemistry. This further underscores the importance of respecting individual choices and recognizing that sexual orientation is not a choice.\n\nThe contrast between the ease with which heterosexual couples can marry and the societal scrutiny faced by same-sex couples highlights the inherent inequality. Marriage should be a universally accessible right, free from public interference and legal barriers. It should be a celebration of love and commitment, not a subject for political debate or societal judgment.",
            "The nature of the internet necessitates an understanding of its public accessibility.  Once information is shared online, it becomes broadly visible, potentially influencing others' perceptions. This reality carries significant implications, especially when discussing sensitive topics. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. Sharing potentially concerning content, such as threats or violent language, can lead to serious repercussions. While it's important to remember that not all online expressions are intended maliciously, the potential for misinterpretation exists.  \n\nSchool officials, tasked with ensuring student safety, must act upon credible threats, even if they originate from online platforms.  A recent incident at my school illustrates this point. A seemingly innocuous online post, when viewed in the context of other information, raised concerns about a student's intentions.  \n\nThe key takeaway is that online content, shared in public forums, carries a degree of permanence and visibility.  Individuals must be mindful of the potential impact of their online presence, understanding that what they share can be accessed and interpreted by a wide audience.  \n\nWhile I believe there are ethical boundaries regarding school officials' access to student online activity,  the safety and well-being of the student body must ultimately take precedence.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial aim of restoring democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. It feels as though we're now engaged in the conflict solely to project an image of global dominance.  \n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's inception.  The personal history between former President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein casts a shadow of doubt on the purely altruistic nature of the conflict. If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a nation in need, that would be a justifiable cause. However, the presence of any personal agendas would undermine the legitimacy of the war.\n\nDespite achieving a decisive initial impact with the war's commencement, the prolonged conflict, spanning several years, has become excessive.  \n\nThe notion of promoting democracy through military intervention initially seemed reasonable, but I fear that our objectives have become muddled and misplaced. It appears we are now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than focusing on the original goals. \n\nThis extended conflict has exacted a heavy toll on our economy. Billions of dollars are being poured into a war that seems to have lost its purpose, money that could be better allocated to addressing pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and public services. \n\nThe fact that we are sacrificing the lives of our citizens in a foreign land for a cause that has become increasingly unclear is deeply troubling. It's time to recognize that the war has run its course and to focus our resources on the needs of our own nation.",
            "The concept of privacy online is a complex one. While sharing information on platforms like Myspace might seem like making it public, there are nuances to consider. A user chooses who they allow to view their profile, essentially granting permission to those they deem \"friends.\" However, the vast reach of the internet means that even seemingly private information can be accessed by unintended parties. \n\nThe ethical implications of monitoring student profiles raise concerns about potential discrimination and the invasion of privacy. While the desire to ensure student safety is understandable, assigning someone the task of scrutinizing every profile seems impractical and potentially harmful. It's crucial to balance safety concerns with individual freedoms.\n\nPersonally, I've experienced the unsettling feeling of encountering strangers who seem to know an excessive amount about me through platforms like Facebook.  Stories of individuals exploiting online information for malicious purposes highlight the potential dangers. It's a constant struggle to maintain a balance between online connectivity and personal security.\n\nThe incident involving a high school banning Myspace usage is particularly thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions can regulate students' online activities. While the school might have had safety concerns, it's debatable whether outright bans are an effective or ethical solution. Ultimately, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online behavior are crucial for navigating the complexities of online privacy.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift towards the current realities and potential future outcomes. \n\nGlobal sentiment, as evidenced by numerous polls, overwhelmingly condemns the war.  A significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and even U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this view.  The war has demonstrably destabilized the region, and the prospect of withdrawal, while challenging, may be the least detrimental option. \n\nThe cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East create significant obstacles to achieving lasting peace and stability.  Democratization efforts, while well-intentioned, may be ill-suited to the region's unique context.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been meticulously weighed against the potential consequences, which have proven to be catastrophic. The current situation resembles quicksand, making any foreseeable resolution fraught with difficulty.\n\nA gradual withdrawal, spanning a year or slightly longer, might be more manageable than an immediate departure. However, the Iraqi people's desire for our withdrawal, as expressed in polls, should be seriously considered.  \n\nUltimately, the question remains: what path offers the best chance for a positive outcome, both for Iraq and for the United States? Perhaps the most ethical approach is to respect the Iraqi people's wishes and allow them to chart their own future, even if it means accepting the inherent risks involved.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, extending beyond the experiences of women. While strides have been made towards equality, certain industries and societal expectations continue to present challenges. \n\nFor instance, women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering obstacles in advancing to leadership positions despite possessing the necessary qualifications. This bias stems from historical perceptions of women's roles in the business world. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents may face societal disapproval, as traditional gender roles often associate financial provision with masculinity.\n\nMoreover, the fashion industry presents a unique dynamic where men's expertise may be questioned based on stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nUltimately, societal norms and ingrained biases contribute to these forms of discrimination. While progress has been made, dismantling these deeply rooted attitudes requires a continuous effort to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that discrimination can manifest in various forms, extending beyond gender to encompass factors such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with various perspectives. While some argue that decriminalization, which reduces it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, is a step in the right direction, others believe it doesn't address the underlying concerns. \n\nOne key argument for decriminalization is the financial burden associated with arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. This process can be costly for municipalities, especially those facing financial challenges. \n\nProponents of decriminalization also point out that it can free up resources for other essential services, such as public education, social programs, and support for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some remain opposed to decriminalization due to concerns about its potential impact on public health and safety. They worry that increased accessibility could lead to more widespread use, including driving under the influence, and contribute to societal norms that normalize marijuana use.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to decriminalize marijuana involves weighing various factors, including public health, safety, financial considerations, and ethical concerns. It's a multifaceted debate that requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of the potential consequences.",
            "I would agree that the Catholic Church has a strong foundation in tradition. The enduring nature of their practices speaks to their commitment to their beliefs. However, I also believe that any institution, especially one as influential as the Church, must be open to adapting to the changing world. \n\nThere are aspects of Catholic doctrine that I find problematic. The emphasis on strict adherence to rules and the judgment of those who do not perfectly conform can feel exclusionary. This is particularly evident in their stance on interfaith marriage, as exemplified by my parents' experience. My father was Episcopalian, and my mother, a devout Catholic, was denied a Church wedding. This lack of acceptance of other faiths seems to contradict the core teaching of love and compassion that is central to Catholicism.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the Church's resistance to change, particularly regarding issues like allowing priests to marry, is outdated and hinders their ability to connect with a modern audience. While I understand the concerns about potential abuses, I believe that personal choices and human nature are complex and cannot be solely attributed to marital status.  \n\nUltimately, I feel a disconnect between the ideals espoused by the Church and the practices that often contradict them.",
            "The issue of marriage equality presents a complex dilemma. Balancing the principles of separation of church and state with the social and legal recognition of different relationship structures is a delicate task.  \n\nDefining marriage, particularly in the context of same-sex unions, raises profound questions.  Should the government, which traditionally doesn't intervene in religious matters like baptism,  become involved in defining and regulating a civil union that has religious significance for some?  \n\nIt seems logical to view marriage as primarily a civil contract, recognizing the commitment between two individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't grant special tax benefits or legal status based on religious affiliation, it shouldn't differentiate between marital unions based on the religious ceremony.\n\nIf states can reach a consensus on a fair and equitable approach to marriage equality, then federal legislation should reflect those shared values.  However, amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems an extreme and unnecessary measure. While this issue is deeply important to many, it doesn't warrant such a drastic constitutional change.  The Constitution should be preserved for matters of fundamental rights and liberties, not for regulating social norms.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my perspective on homosexuality is complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully align with that lifestyle. However, I believe in the fundamental right for individuals to choose their own paths and advocate for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nI think this issue is best handled at the state level rather than imposed nationally.  The United States is diverse, with varying political leanings and societal values. Democratic-leaning states are likely to be more progressive on issues like same-sex marriage, while Republican-leaning states may hold different views. \n\nIndividuals choose where they reside, and I believe they should respect the laws and social norms of the state they call home. If a state legalizes gay marriage, those living there should accept that as the prevailing stance within their community.\n\nUltimately, I support equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nThe federal government should not dictate social policies that are best decided at the state level.  A president, even one with strong personal beliefs, shouldn't impose a national stance on such a sensitive and multifaceted issue.  The ideal solution is to allow each state to determine its own approach, fostering a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse viewpoints can be accommodated.",
            "School officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students.  While the concept of privacy is important,  it's crucial to weigh that against the potential for harm.  Social media platforms like MySpace, being publicly accessible, inherently carry the risk of content being viewed by anyone, including school officials.  \n\nIf school officials become aware of something on a student's profile that raises concerns about their safety or the safety of others, it's understandable why they would investigate.  Preventing tragedies like Columbine should be a top priority, and if accessing a student's public profile helps achieve that goal, it's a justifiable action.  \n\nIt's important to remember that actions online have consequences, just like actions in the real world.  Students should be mindful of what they share publicly, as it can have unintended repercussions.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I strongly supported military action in response to the attacks, fueled by a desire for retribution. Looking back, however, I believe the emotional climate at the time overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences.\n\nOur involvement in the conflict feels like a hasty decision, lacking a comprehensive plan and adequate preparation. I've come to believe that our presence has not achieved the desired results and may even have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe internal conflicts within the region seem to be a significant obstacle to stability. It's difficult to assess how our involvement truly contributes to progress when factions are deeply divided amongst themselves. \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now question whether military intervention was the most effective approach.\n\nThe realities of conflict in that region differ drastically from our own experiences.  What we perceive as progress may not align with the aspirations of the local population.  Perhaps a more diplomatic and collaborative strategy would have been more fruitful."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It's my opinion that the Catholic Church could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. There's been discussion about the Church losing members, and I believe this decline may be partly due to its lack of inclusivity on matters like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control.\n\nWhile the Church has strong convictions on these topics, which is understandable, some of its views seem outdated in today's society. If the Church were to embrace a more contemporary perspective, it might see a renewed sense of engagement from its followers. \n\nI've heard concerns from individuals who are distancing themselves from the Church because they disagree with its positions on these sensitive subjects.  People are increasingly seeking a faith community that aligns with their personal beliefs and values.\n\nFor example, a person who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable in an environment where it's condemned, or someone who believes in same-sex marriage might feel alienated by the Church's opposition. \n\nI personally think allowing female priests and permitting married priests would be positive changes. However, it's difficult to say definitively if these reforms would have prevented past scandals.  \n\nThe Church's doctrine states that priests are dedicated to God, but I see no reason why they couldn't also have fulfilling family lives. Most people in the world balance their professional commitments with their personal relationships, and I believe priests should have that same opportunity.",
            "I believe that everyone should have the right to marry, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice; people are born with certain inclinations.  Therefore, it seems unfair to deny someone the right to marry simply because of who they are.\n\nWhile I haven't deeply explored the legal and philosophical complexities of same-sex marriage, I firmly believe that government shouldn't dictate who can and cannot marry.  Marriage is a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be limited to ensuring equal rights and protections for all citizens.  \n\nUltimately,  it's important to treat everyone with respect and dignity, and that includes recognizing the fundamental right to love and commit to another person.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a topic that demands careful consideration.  While some argue that allowing gay couples to marry threatens the traditional family structure, this perspective overlooks the fundamental differences between relationships and the diverse ways individuals choose to express love and commitment.  \n\nIt is crucial to recognize that marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not solely a religious institution.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry based on religious beliefs raises concerns about the separation of church and state.  If civil unions are accepted, extending the full legal benefits of marriage to same-sex couples seems like a logical and equitable step. \n\nThere are compelling arguments supporting this position.  Scientific research has shown that same-sex relationships exhibit similar patterns of success and satisfaction as heterosexual relationships.  Furthermore, denying same-sex couples the right to marry can have serious consequences for their families and well-being.  For instance, in healthcare settings, legal partners may be denied visitation rights, highlighting the importance of legal recognition for these relationships. \n\nConcerns regarding the impact of same-sex parents on their children have also been raised.  However, evidence suggests that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  It is essential to base our understanding on factual data rather than unfounded prejudices.\n\nUltimately, the question of same-sex marriage is about equality and fairness.  Treating all individuals and couples with dignity and respect, regardless of their sexual orientation, is fundamental to a just and inclusive society.  It is time to move beyond outdated notions and embrace a more equitable future where all couples have the right to legal recognition and the same benefits and protections.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer gave me a unique perspective on the legality versus medicinal value of certain substances. Observing firsthand how controlled substances, like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used responsibly for their therapeutic benefits made me consider the double standard surrounding marijuana. \n\nWhile I understand the concerns regarding public accessibility, I believe restricting its use solely based on its legal status is misguided. \n\nJust because a substance is illegal doesn't automatically disqualify it from having medicinal properties.  Many substances with proven medical benefits have faced legal challenges in the past.  \n\nIt's crucial to approach this issue with a balanced perspective.  While acknowledging the potential for abuse, we should also recognize the potential benefits of marijuana for medical purposes.  Perhaps a gradual integration, similar to the controlled distribution of other pharmaceuticals, could mitigate concerns while allowing for responsible use.\n\nThe negative stigma associated with marijuana often overshadows its potential benefits.  Similar to alcohol, which can be harmful if abused, marijuana, when used responsibly, could be a valuable tool in managing certain medical conditions.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that by removing the taboo surrounding marijuana and fostering open, informed discussions, we can create a more nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and risks.",
            "I believe the Catholic Church has definitely adapted to the modern era. It's certainly less rigid than it once was.  I can personally recall my childhood, attending church every Sunday in my Sunday best - complete with a matching dress, shoes, and purse. It was a regular part of my life, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my friends there on the weekends.  \n\nHowever, things have changed.  As I've gotten older, the church has implemented a special Mass geared towards teenagers, cutting it down to a more manageable thirty minutes. People dress much more casually now, especially in the summer. It's not uncommon to see families arrive straight from the beach, still in their swimwear. Even at the morning Masses, where I used to always dress up, I now see people in jeans and khakis.  It's definitely become more relaxed.\n\nWhile I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this shift towards a more casual atmosphere is the most noticeable change I've observed.\n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I think it's a complex issue.  I don't believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining women would have prevented these tragedies.  Pedophilia isn't limited to any one profession or circumstance.  \n\nIt's a deeply personal issue rooted in an individual's nature, and, unfortunately, some individuals may be predisposed to these harmful behaviors regardless of their marital status or religious calling.  There are religions that allow married clergy, but that doesn't mean those individuals are immune to these issues.   \n\nIf someone truly desires to practice their faith while also being married, they might consider exploring other denominations that allow for this.  It's ultimately a personal choice.\n\nI realize this is a sensitive topic, and I'm not pretending to have all the answers.  It's a tragedy that these events have occurred, and my hope is that the church will continue to address these issues with transparency and accountability.",
            "The initial concept, while not initially objectionable, was overshadowed by the lingering impact of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the lead-up to the Iraq War was marked by several justifications, some of which have since been proven inaccurate.  \n\nThe Bush administration's early connection of the Iraq War to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, along with the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, has deeply troubled me.  These claims, now demonstrably false, raise serious concerns about the administration's transparency with the American public.  \n\nEven prominent figures like Colin Powell, who delivered a significant presentation at the United Nations, have expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the time.  This, to me, constitutes a serious breach of public trust, potentially even an impeachable offense.  \n\nThere's a perception that the Bush administration has consistently disregarded the Constitution, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards military action, as evidenced by the assertions made by former Treasury Secretary [Name redacted] in his book following his departure from office.  \n\nThe younger Bush seemed to carry a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, potentially stemming from his father's administration's dealings with Iraq.  Furthermore, the pursuit of expanded energy resources appears to have been a motivating factor, which is a highly questionable approach.  \n\nThe prolonged duration of the conflict necessitates a delicate withdrawal strategy.  An abrupt departure risks plunging the country into civil war, resulting in further casualties.  \n\nThe proposed solution involving a coalition of regional nations, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order raises its own concerns.  Long-term implications for Iraq's sovereignty are unclear, as the interim government appears to be disintegrating. \n\nThe Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the limited control exerted by the Prime Minister, whose name escapes me, contribute to a volatile political climate.  The rise of figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, who now holds significant parliamentary seats, further complicates the situation.  \n\nThe current political landscape is characterized by internal strife and a struggle for power among various factions.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivations behind the conflict, such as responding to the tragic events of September 11th, I question the continued necessity of our involvement. \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legal and ethical implications of our military presence. Furthermore, the stated goals of establishing democracy and securing oil resources seem to be at odds with the reality on the ground. \n\nThe process of building a stable democracy in Iraq is a long and challenging undertaking, and the current situation appears to be exacerbating existing divisions within the country. The potential for unintended consequences, such as fueling further instability and anti-American sentiment, is a serious concern.\n\nIt is essential to consider the human cost of this conflict, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The ongoing violence and displacement have had a devastating impact on Iraqi society, while the sacrifices made by our troops should not be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, I believe that a strategic withdrawal from Iraq, coupled with a renewed focus on diplomatic solutions, is the most responsible path forward. This would allow for a more peaceful resolution to the conflict and minimize further bloodshed.",
            "The issue of [mention the specific issue being discussed] presents a complex dilemma. My personal stance is grounded in the fundamental principle of separation of church and state, as enshrined in our Constitution. This separation is crucial to ensuring religious freedom and preventing the imposition of one religious viewpoint over others.  \n\nAttempting to legislate on this matter, particularly through an amendment, seems to me to be a direct contradiction of this core principle.  It would essentially grant the government the authority to dictate religious practices, which I believe is inappropriate and potentially harmful.\n\nFurthermore, such an action could be perceived as favoring certain religious beliefs over others, creating division and potentially undermining the very fabric of religious tolerance that our nation was founded upon. \n\nI believe the decision regarding [mention the specific issue] should remain within the purview of individual religious institutions, allowing for diverse interpretations and practices without government interference.",
            "The conflict in Iraq presents a complex and multifaceted issue. I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency, with attempts to link it to the September 11th attacks, despite their tenuous connection. This manipulation of public sentiment, fueled by the nation's grief and anger, ultimately led to the commencement of hostilities in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I hold a strong anti-war stance, particularly regarding preemptive strikes. The Iraqi conflict echoes historical precedents like the Vietnam War, highlighting the government's failure to learn from past mistakes. The immense loss of American lives, coupled with the unforeseen consequences of regime change, underscores the gravity of this situation.\n\nThe removal of the Iraqi government without a comprehensive plan for the ensuing power vacuum resulted in chaos and instability. The attempt to establish a democratic system in Iraq, reminiscent of the endeavors in Vietnam, proved to be a protracted and arduous process.   \n\nThe complexities of nation-building, as exemplified by our own nation's historical struggles, demonstrate that establishing a stable and prosperous democracy is a lengthy and challenging undertaking.  \n\nThe administration's portrayal of a swift and successful intervention proved to be overly optimistic. The prolonged conflict, with its ongoing American casualties and the continued training of Iraqi security forces, raises crucial questions about the feasibility and ethical implications of our involvement.\n\nThe imperative to fulfill our commitments to the Iraqi people while weighing the escalating human and financial costs presents a formidable dilemma. The lack of clarity regarding the original objectives and the ongoing presence of oil interests further complicate the situation.\n\nThe discrepancy between the stated reasons for intervention and the reality on the ground, particularly the absence of weapons of mass destruction as initially claimed, casts doubt on the government's transparency and decision-making process.\n\nUltimately, the path forward remains uncertain. My hope is for a swift and peaceful resolution that brings stability and prosperity to Iraq while minimizing further loss of life.",
            "I firmly support marriage equality. This has been a deeply held belief for me. I see it as a matter of personal choice, something increasingly understood to have biological roots rather than solely sociological influences. \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control feels profoundly wrong. It's inhumane to restrict someone's fundamental freedoms due to their sexual orientation. I've always advocated for equal rights for all, including the right to marry.\n\nPolitics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage should be a private matter, a decision made between individuals and their families. In my neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live fulfilling lives, raising families and contributing to their community, even though they lack legal recognition.\n\nThe notion that any individual or institution, especially the government, should define or control who can marry is troubling. It's a matter of personal autonomy and should remain a private affair. \n\nScientific research increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis, potentially influenced by factors like genetics and brain chemistry. This further underscores the importance of respecting individual choices and recognizing that sexual orientation is not a choice.\n\nThe contrast between the ease with which heterosexual couples can marry and the societal scrutiny faced by same-sex couples highlights the inherent inequality. Marriage should be a universally accessible right, free from public interference and legal barriers. It should be a celebration of love and commitment, not a subject for political debate or societal judgment.",
            "The nature of the internet necessitates an understanding of its public accessibility.  Once information is shared online, it becomes broadly visible, potentially influencing others' perceptions. This reality carries significant implications, especially when discussing sensitive topics. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. Sharing potentially concerning content, such as threats or violent language, can lead to serious repercussions. While it's important to remember that not all online expressions are intended maliciously, the potential for misinterpretation exists.  \n\nSchool officials, tasked with ensuring student safety, must act upon credible threats, even if they originate from online platforms.  A recent incident at my school illustrates this point. A seemingly innocuous online post, when viewed in the context of other information, raised concerns about a student's intentions.  \n\nThe key takeaway is that online content, shared in public forums, carries a degree of permanence and visibility.  Individuals must be mindful of the potential impact of their online presence, understanding that what they share can be accessed and interpreted by a wide audience.  \n\nWhile I believe there are ethical boundaries regarding school officials' access to student online activity,  the safety and well-being of the student body must ultimately take precedence.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial aim of restoring democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. It feels as though we're now engaged in the conflict solely to project an image of global dominance.  \n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's inception.  The personal history between former President Bush's father and Saddam Hussein casts a shadow of doubt on the purely altruistic nature of the conflict. If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a nation in need, that would be a justifiable cause. However, the presence of any personal agendas would undermine the legitimacy of the war.\n\nDespite achieving a decisive initial impact with the war's commencement, the prolonged conflict, spanning several years, has become excessive.  \n\nThe notion of promoting democracy through military intervention initially seemed reasonable, but I fear that our objectives have become muddled and misplaced. It appears we are now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than focusing on the original goals. \n\nThis extended conflict has exacted a heavy toll on our economy. Billions of dollars are being poured into a war that seems to have lost its purpose, money that could be better allocated to addressing pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and public services. \n\nThe fact that we are sacrificing the lives of our citizens in a foreign land for a cause that has become increasingly unclear is deeply troubling. It's time to recognize that the war has run its course and to focus our resources on the needs of our own nation.",
            "The concept of privacy online is a complex one. While sharing information on platforms like Myspace might seem like making it public, there are nuances to consider. A user chooses who they allow to view their profile, essentially granting permission to those they deem \"friends.\" However, the vast reach of the internet means that even seemingly private information can be accessed by unintended parties. \n\nThe ethical implications of monitoring student profiles raise concerns about potential discrimination and the invasion of privacy. While the desire to ensure student safety is understandable, assigning someone the task of scrutinizing every profile seems impractical and potentially harmful. It's crucial to balance safety concerns with individual freedoms.\n\nPersonally, I've experienced the unsettling feeling of encountering strangers who seem to know an excessive amount about me through platforms like Facebook.  Stories of individuals exploiting online information for malicious purposes highlight the potential dangers. It's a constant struggle to maintain a balance between online connectivity and personal security.\n\nThe incident involving a high school banning Myspace usage is particularly thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions can regulate students' online activities. While the school might have had safety concerns, it's debatable whether outright bans are an effective or ethical solution. Ultimately, fostering digital literacy and promoting responsible online behavior are crucial for navigating the complexities of online privacy.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift towards the current realities and potential future outcomes. \n\nGlobal sentiment, as evidenced by numerous polls, overwhelmingly condemns the war.  A significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and even U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this view.  The war has demonstrably destabilized the region, and the prospect of withdrawal, while challenging, may be the least detrimental option. \n\nThe cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East create significant obstacles to achieving lasting peace and stability.  Democratization efforts, while well-intentioned, may be ill-suited to the region's unique context.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been meticulously weighed against the potential consequences, which have proven to be catastrophic. The current situation resembles quicksand, making any foreseeable resolution fraught with difficulty.\n\nA gradual withdrawal, spanning a year or slightly longer, might be more manageable than an immediate departure. However, the Iraqi people's desire for our withdrawal, as expressed in polls, should be seriously considered.  \n\nUltimately, the question remains: what path offers the best chance for a positive outcome, both for Iraq and for the United States? Perhaps the most ethical approach is to respect the Iraqi people's wishes and allow them to chart their own future, even if it means accepting the inherent risks involved.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, extending beyond the experiences of women. While strides have been made towards equality, certain industries and societal expectations continue to present challenges. \n\nFor instance, women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" encountering obstacles in advancing to leadership positions despite possessing the necessary qualifications. This bias stems from historical perceptions of women's roles in the business world. Similarly, men who choose to be stay-at-home parents may face societal disapproval, as traditional gender roles often associate financial provision with masculinity.\n\nMoreover, the fashion industry presents a unique dynamic where men's expertise may be questioned based on stereotypes about masculinity and fashion. \n\nUltimately, societal norms and ingrained biases contribute to these forms of discrimination. While progress has been made, dismantling these deeply rooted attitudes requires a continuous effort to challenge stereotypes and promote inclusivity.\n\nIt is essential to recognize that discrimination can manifest in various forms, extending beyond gender to encompass factors such as socioeconomic background and regional upbringing.",
            "The legalization of marijuana is a complex issue with various perspectives. While some argue that decriminalization, which reduces it from a criminal offense to a minor infraction, is a step in the right direction, others believe it doesn't address the underlying concerns. \n\nOne key argument for decriminalization is the financial burden associated with arresting, housing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses. This process can be costly for municipalities, especially those facing financial challenges. \n\nProponents of decriminalization also point out that it can free up resources for other essential services, such as public education, social programs, and support for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some remain opposed to decriminalization due to concerns about its potential impact on public health and safety. They worry that increased accessibility could lead to more widespread use, including driving under the influence, and contribute to societal norms that normalize marijuana use.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether or not to decriminalize marijuana involves weighing various factors, including public health, safety, financial considerations, and ethical concerns. It's a multifaceted debate that requires careful consideration and a nuanced understanding of the potential consequences.",
            "I would agree that the Catholic Church has a strong foundation in tradition. The enduring nature of their practices speaks to their commitment to their beliefs. However, I also believe that any institution, especially one as influential as the Church, must be open to adapting to the changing world. \n\nThere are aspects of Catholic doctrine that I find problematic. The emphasis on strict adherence to rules and the judgment of those who do not perfectly conform can feel exclusionary. This is particularly evident in their stance on interfaith marriage, as exemplified by my parents' experience. My father was Episcopalian, and my mother, a devout Catholic, was denied a Church wedding. This lack of acceptance of other faiths seems to contradict the core teaching of love and compassion that is central to Catholicism.\n\nFurthermore, I believe the Church's resistance to change, particularly regarding issues like allowing priests to marry, is outdated and hinders their ability to connect with a modern audience. While I understand the concerns about potential abuses, I believe that personal choices and human nature are complex and cannot be solely attributed to marital status.  \n\nUltimately, I feel a disconnect between the ideals espoused by the Church and the practices that often contradict them.",
            "The issue of marriage equality presents a complex dilemma. Balancing the principles of separation of church and state with the social and legal recognition of different relationship structures is a delicate task.  \n\nDefining marriage, particularly in the context of same-sex unions, raises profound questions.  Should the government, which traditionally doesn't intervene in religious matters like baptism,  become involved in defining and regulating a civil union that has religious significance for some?  \n\nIt seems logical to view marriage as primarily a civil contract, recognizing the commitment between two individuals regardless of their sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't grant special tax benefits or legal status based on religious affiliation, it shouldn't differentiate between marital unions based on the religious ceremony.\n\nIf states can reach a consensus on a fair and equitable approach to marriage equality, then federal legislation should reflect those shared values.  However, amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage seems an extreme and unnecessary measure. While this issue is deeply important to many, it doesn't warrant such a drastic constitutional change.  The Constitution should be preserved for matters of fundamental rights and liberties, not for regulating social norms.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my perspective on homosexuality is complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully align with that lifestyle. However, I believe in the fundamental right for individuals to choose their own paths and advocate for legal recognition of same-sex marriage.\n\nI think this issue is best handled at the state level rather than imposed nationally.  The United States is diverse, with varying political leanings and societal values. Democratic-leaning states are likely to be more progressive on issues like same-sex marriage, while Republican-leaning states may hold different views. \n\nIndividuals choose where they reside, and I believe they should respect the laws and social norms of the state they call home. If a state legalizes gay marriage, those living there should accept that as the prevailing stance within their community.\n\nUltimately, I support equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nThe federal government should not dictate social policies that are best decided at the state level.  A president, even one with strong personal beliefs, shouldn't impose a national stance on such a sensitive and multifaceted issue.  The ideal solution is to allow each state to determine its own approach, fostering a more inclusive and respectful society where diverse viewpoints can be accommodated.",
            "School officials have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students.  While the concept of privacy is important,  it's crucial to weigh that against the potential for harm.  Social media platforms like MySpace, being publicly accessible, inherently carry the risk of content being viewed by anyone, including school officials.  \n\nIf school officials become aware of something on a student's profile that raises concerns about their safety or the safety of others, it's understandable why they would investigate.  Preventing tragedies like Columbine should be a top priority, and if accessing a student's public profile helps achieve that goal, it's a justifiable action.  \n\nIt's important to remember that actions online have consequences, just like actions in the real world.  Students should be mindful of what they share publicly, as it can have unintended repercussions.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I strongly supported military action in response to the attacks, fueled by a desire for retribution. Looking back, however, I believe the emotional climate at the time overshadowed careful consideration of the long-term consequences.\n\nOur involvement in the conflict feels like a hasty decision, lacking a comprehensive plan and adequate preparation. I've come to believe that our presence has not achieved the desired results and may even have exacerbated the situation. \n\nThe internal conflicts within the region seem to be a significant obstacle to stability. It's difficult to assess how our involvement truly contributes to progress when factions are deeply divided amongst themselves. \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now question whether military intervention was the most effective approach.\n\nThe realities of conflict in that region differ drastically from our own experiences.  What we perceive as progress may not align with the aspirations of the local population.  Perhaps a more diplomatic and collaborative strategy would have been more fruitful."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues is a contributing factor.  The Church's views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are considered traditional by some, but they may appear outdated to a younger generation.  \n\nMany people feel that the Church's rigid stance on these issues creates a sense of exclusion and discourages individuals who hold different beliefs. This disconnect can lead to disillusionment and a loss of faith. \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might find it difficult to reconcile their beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, someone who is gay or lesbian might feel unwelcome in a community that does not accept their relationship.\n\nThe Church's position on these matters hinders its ability to connect with a diverse and evolving society. Adopting a more inclusive and progressive approach might help the Church retain its relevance and attract new members.\n\nWhile some may argue that these are matters of faith and tradition, it is important to recognize that social norms and values are constantly changing. The Church should strive to engage with these changes and adapt its teachings accordingly to remain a relevant and meaningful institution.",
            "I believe that everyone deserves equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unjust to discriminate against individuals based on something they were born with.  \n\nDenying same-sex couples the right to marry sends a message that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships. This is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nI don't believe the federal government should intervene in personal matters like marriage.  It's a private decision between two consenting adults.  Government involvement in such matters seems unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nUltimately, I think it's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, and that includes supporting the right of same-sex couples to marry.",
            "Marriage equality is a matter of fundamental fairness. There isn't a valid reason to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections afforded to heterosexual couples.  \n\nSome argue that allowing same-sex marriage threatens the traditional family structure. However, this perspective overlooks the diversity of family forms and conflates marriage with a specific religious or social construct.  Marriage, at its core, is a legal and societal recognition of a committed relationship.  \n\nDenying marriage rights to same-sex couples creates significant legal and social inequalities. For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and taxation, partners in same-sex relationships often lack the same protections as married couples.  These disparities can have profound consequences for individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, many studies have demonstrated that same-sex relationships are just as stable and fulfilling as heterosexual relationships.  The factors contributing to relationship success are not determined by sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between religious beliefs and civil law.  While some religious institutions may oppose same-sex marriage, the government should uphold the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious views.  \n\nThe argument that same-sex marriage will negatively impact children is unfounded.  Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nOpposition to marriage equality often stems from prejudice and misinformation.  \n\nIt's crucial to rely on evidence-based research and to promote understanding and acceptance of all individuals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is a matter of social justice and equality for all.",
            "During my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I encountered a common misconception: the assumption that illegality automatically equates to inherent harm.  While I firmly believe drugs should not be readily available to the public, I do advocate for their medicinal use.  The legality of a substance does not dictate its potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, utilized in pharmacies for their proven medical benefits.  To deny those benefits simply because of societal stigma surrounding marijuana is illogical. We should embrace its potential therapeutic value.\n\nDrawing parallels to alcohol, while both substances can be misused, marijuana's potential for harm appears less severe.  A gradual integration of marijuana into a regulated system, rather than immediate legalization, might be prudent to mitigate potential abuse.  However, dismantling the negative stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to foster responsible use.\n\nThe perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug is largely driven by its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that its effects are not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting public perception and acknowledging its potential benefits, we can create a more informed and responsible approach to marijuana use, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "The church has definitely made some adjustments to better suit life in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back, when I was younger, church attendance was a regular Sunday ritual. I remember always dressing up—cute dresses, matching shoes and purses—the whole nine yards. That was the norm back then. Attending a private school meant seeing all my friends at church on weekends. We'd just go, you know, hang out.\n\nBut things have changed as I've gotten older. They've introduced a more casual \"teenager mass\" that's condensed to just thirty minutes. People dress a lot more relaxed now, especially in the summer when beachgoers might show up straight from the sand. Families often arrive late, adding to the laid-back vibe. Even at the morning masses, where I used to be quite formal, you see more jeans and khakis these days.  \n\nI'd say the biggest change is the shift towards casual attire. That's the most noticeable difference I've seen in my church. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about the internal politics of the church or anything like that.\n\nAs for the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't believe those things could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have inappropriate attractions towards children. I think it's about the individual, not their marital status. Becoming a priest is a personal choice. There are other religions, like those portrayed on TV shows, where clergy are allowed to marry. If someone deeply wants to practice their faith and be married, they could perhaps consider those alternatives.\n\nI think pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. It's not something people simply choose; it's more likely a biological predisposition.  While upbringing might play a role, I believe genetics are a major factor.  Marriage wouldn't hide that; it might even bring it to the surface eventually. \n\nIf the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's truly wrong. But I don't think they were always aware of everything.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War wasn't inherently problematic, but the context of the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow. It seemed the U.S. government used the tragedy as a springboard to justify pretexts for military action. The Bush administration made connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been debunked. This has deeply troubled me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions feel like a betrayal of the American public.  Even Colin Powell, who delivered a pivotal presentation at the UN, now acknowledges he lacked conviction in the presented evidence at the time. This, in my view, constitutes malfeasance and potentially impeachable offenses.  \n\nThe Bush administration's general disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11, is also deeply concerning.  There's a sense that they entered office with a preconceived notion of engaging in warfare. This is supported by allegations made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, who, after his departure from office, detailed this intent in his book.\n\nThe younger Bush appeared to harbor a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and perhaps sought to secure energy resources in the long term. This approach feels manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has undoubtedly dragged on too long, an immediate withdrawal could lead to further instability, potentially triggering a civil war with catastrophic consequences. The UN and the U.S. seem to be exploring an alternative: a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, this solution raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and future. The current interim government appears to be faltering, and the political process is fraught with tension.\n\nNews reports indicate the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable, with the Prime Minister seemingly lacking true control.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict with, now hold significant political power.  Radical factions continue to vie for control, exacerbating the political climate.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue. Its origin can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11, with many believing it was a response to the terrorist attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has sparked debate about its legitimacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to form a definitive stance on the war. While I understand the desire to combat terrorism and promote democracy, I am also concerned about the long-term consequences of our involvement. The war has had a profound impact on Iraqi society, leading to instability and displacement. \n\nThe complexities of establishing a functioning democracy in a nation with a long history of authoritarian rule are significant. Furthermore, the presence of foreign troops can exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment, potentially hindering the establishment of lasting peace.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the human cost of war, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The economic burden on the United States is also a factor. While the stated goals of the war may be noble, it's essential to analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs. \n\nUltimately, finding a resolution to the conflict that promotes stability, justice, and self-determination for the Iraqi people remains a significant challenge.",
            "The issue of  legality surrounding this particular topic is one that I believe should remain with religious institutions. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a fundamental cornerstone of our nation, clearly outlining the boundaries between governmental authority and religious practice. \n\nAny attempt by the government to impose its will on this matter would be a direct violation of this established principle. It would essentially amount to choosing one religious viewpoint over another, which is not the role of the government. While certain denominations may hold strong convictions against this practice, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs within various faiths.\n\nFurthermore, the very concept of amending the Constitution to address this issue raises serious concerns.  Amending such a foundational document should be reserved for matters of utmost national importance, not for addressing the specific tenets of individual religions. Additionally, an amendment aimed at restricting this practice would be unprecedented, as most amendments serve to limit governmental power rather than individual freedoms.\n\nI firmly believe that this matter should be left to the guidance and discretion of religious organizations. The government has no place in dictating the internal affairs of churches or other religious bodies.  It's essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom and allow each faith to determine its own stance on this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq remains a complex and deeply troubling issue. From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency. While the tragic events of September 11th understandably fueled a desire for action, the connection between those attacks and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best. This, I fear, was exploited to manipulate public sentiment.\n\nPersonally, I am fundamentally opposed to preemptive war. The Iraq conflict, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War. The immense loss of American lives is a devastating consequence, and the unintended consequences of removing a nation's leadership were poorly anticipated. The subsequent power vacuum created instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges faced in Vietnam.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic system in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved far more complex than initially envisioned. Just as the US struggled to solidify democracy in its own history, imposing a new political structure on another nation demands patience and a realistic understanding of the long-term commitment required. \n\nThe initial optimism surrounding the invasion seems misplaced, overlooking the inherent difficulties of nation-building.  The ongoing presence of US troops, the continued training of Iraqi security forces, and the persistent threat of insurgency highlight the enduring complexities of the situation. \n\nFurthermore, the question of motive arises. While the stated goal was to spread democracy, the significant oil reserves of Iraq cannot be ignored. The lack of conclusive evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the continued reliance on oil from the region, raises concerns about the transparency and genuine motivations behind the conflict.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is a stark reminder of the profound consequences of war, both for those directly involved and for the international community. I hope for a swift and peaceful resolution, but acknowledge the grim reality that lasting stability may be elusive.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and evidence increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has biological roots rather than purely sociological ones.  Denying individuals rights based on something they cannot control is fundamentally unjust. \n\nI believe personal relationships, including marriage, should be private matters, free from government interference. Politics and legislation have no place in dictating who can and cannot love whom.  Observing diverse families in my own community, such as openly gay couples who live and function just like any other family, reinforces this belief.\n\nRecent studies and reports indicate that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors, potentially even predisposed at birth. This further strengthens the argument against societal or legal restrictions. \n\nThe double standard surrounding marriage is stark. Heterosexual couples can choose to marry privately, while same-sex couples face public scrutiny and legal barriers. This discrepancy highlights the need for equal rights and recognition for all loving couples.  Marriage should be a personal and private matter, not subject to political or national regulations.",
            "The internet operates as a public platform, meaning anything shared there is accessible to a broad audience. As a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts have significantly influenced perceptions of individuals.  \n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential consequences of what we share online. Posts about sensitive topics, such as violence or threats, can be misinterpreted and lead to serious repercussions. \n\nWhile it's natural to express ourselves freely, it's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact.  One never knows who might see what we post, and even seemingly harmless content can be taken out of context.\n\nThere are instances where concerns raised about online activity are legitimate, such as when a student's posts express potential danger to themselves or others. In such cases, school officials may need to investigate to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nHowever, it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy. Blindly monitoring students' online activity without proper justification is a breach of trust.  \n\nUltimately, individuals should be mindful of their online presence and understand that their digital footprint can have lasting consequences.",
            "The conflict has undoubtedly persisted for an excessive duration. While the initial intent, aimed at establishing democratic principles in a nation lacking a fair political system, appeared noble, I believe we have strayed from that original objective. \n\nIt seems we might be engaged in the war simply to assert our global dominance, a pursuit that raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the war's genesis could be linked to pre-existing tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein, casting a shadow of doubt on the initial motivations. \n\nIf the goal truly was to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, the war's legitimacy diminishes considerably. \n\nRegardless, the conflict has dragged on far too long. The initial military action, while forceful, conveyed a clear message. However, the prolonged engagement, spanning several years, has lost its initial purpose. \n\nIf our aim was to liberate a nation from tyranny, that was a worthy goal. But over time, I fear our objectives have become muddled and misguided. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a lasting resolution. \n\nThe war's financial burden is also a significant concern. Billions are being poured into a conflict that has outlived its usefulness. These resources could be better allocated to addressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other pressing social needs. \n\nIt's time to end this war. The Iraqi government and its officials must ultimately take responsibility for their own nation. We have fulfilled our initial purpose and should prioritize our own citizens' well-being.",
            "The concept of online privacy is a complex one. While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, the question of to what extent schools can regulate students' online activities is debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, students who choose to share personal information online should be aware that it may be viewed by a wider audience. This includes potential risks, such as encountering individuals with malicious intent.  The example of the man who used online information to manipulate a young woman highlights the dangers that can arise from readily accessible personal data.\n\nHowever, banning social media entirely seems like a heavy-handed approach.  Students need to learn how to navigate the digital world responsibly, and outright prohibition may not be the most effective solution.  It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom and the school's responsibility to protect its students.\n\nPerhaps a more nuanced approach would involve educating students about online safety and privacy best practices, rather than resorting to blanket bans. This could empower them to make informed decisions about their online presence and minimize potential risks.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue, and my initial stance against it aligns with the prevailing public opinion, which overwhelmingly considers it a mistake.  \n\nSurveys conducted across the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a consistent sentiment:  a significant majority, ranging from seventy-five to eighty percent, believe the war was a poor decision. This includes a large portion of U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, who also express a desire for withdrawal within a year.\n\nThe conflict has undeniably been a source of turmoil since its inception, and the prospect of withdrawal presents its own set of challenges.  The Middle East's cultural complexities and differing values pose significant obstacles to achieving lasting stability through direct intervention.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive,  the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential consequences, which have unfolded as a multifaceted disaster.  \n\nDespite the administration's justifications for remaining in Iraq, I find them unconvincing. A gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer might be more manageable, but the fundamental question remains:  what legitimate reason compels us to remain beyond that point?  \n\nThe Iraqi people themselves have voiced their desire for our departure, with a significant portion advocating for immediate withdrawal. Their perspectives, as those most directly affected, deserve considerable weight. \n\nLeaving Iraq while acknowledging their autonomy, even if it leads to unforeseen challenges, could ultimately be more ethically sound than continuing a protracted presence that is increasingly viewed as detrimental by both the Iraqi people and a large segment of the American public.",
            "Gender discrimination persists in the United States, although it's not limited to women. The specific field of work often plays a significant role. While women generally face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also encounter prejudice. For instance, societal expectations often pressure men to be the primary breadwinner, leading to judgment when they choose to stay home with children.\n\nSimilarly, the fashion industry presents unique hurdles for men. They may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable about fashion if they don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. This highlights how deeply ingrained societal norms can influence perceptions and opportunities, regardless of gender.\n\nProgress has been made in challenging these discriminatory practices. Women are increasingly attaining leadership positions, and the acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is growing. However, change is gradual. By highlighting the strengths and experiences of those who are often stereotyped, and by promoting inclusivity, we can continue to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society.  \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that discrimination can extend beyond gender. Factors like socioeconomic background and education level can also play a role. For example, someone with exceptional intelligence but limited formal education might face prejudice based on their communication style. This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of discrimination and the need for a holistic approach to addressing it.",
            "The legalization debate around marijuana is complex. While it hasn't been fully legalized in all areas, many places have chosen to decriminalize it. This means that possession of small amounts is treated less severely than a criminal offense, akin to a traffic violation.  \n\nWhile decriminalization does lessen the immediate legal repercussions, concerns remain about the long-term consequences.  A criminal record, even for a minor offense, can still impact job prospects and other opportunities. \n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the financial burden of arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is substantial.  They contend that these resources could be better allocated to areas like education, social programs, and public health. \n\nUrban centers with progressive viewpoints, like Denver, have often taken this approach, believing that decriminalization can free up funds for essential services.  \n\nThe debate also touches on the social implications of marijuana use. Some worry that full legalization might lead to increased public consumption, potentially impacting social norms and safety. It raises questions about the regulation and control of marijuana sales and its accessibility to minors.\n\nUltimately, the debate revolves around balancing individual liberties with societal concerns, weighing the potential benefits of decriminalization against the perceived risks of increased usage and its impact on communities.",
            "My perspective on the Catholic Church is complex. While I appreciate its enduring traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's approach to inclusivity.  While the teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices seem to contradict this message. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage was not permitted in the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian faith. This experience highlighted what I perceive as a lack of tolerance towards those outside the Catholic tradition. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that the Church's strict adherence to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion for those who don't perfectly align with its tenets. This rigidity, coupled with a resistance to change, can be discouraging for individuals seeking a more welcoming and understanding faith community. \n\nI recognize that the issue of priestly celibacy is a sensitive one, and I understand the arguments both for and against it. While allowing priests to marry might address certain concerns, I believe the root cause of misconduct lies within individuals and not solely within their marital status.  The problem of abuse is a serious one that requires multifaceted solutions, and addressing it effectively necessitates a focus on accountability, prevention, and support for survivors.",
            "This issue is incredibly complex, and I haven't fully formed my opinion on it yet. It's difficult to definitively say which side is right or wrong because it touches on such sensitive areas like the separation of church and state and the very definition of marriage. \n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's beliefs while ensuring fairness is a significant challenge.  \n\nPersonally, I believe civil unions should be recognized and respected.  Perhaps defining marriage as solely a civil contract, separate from religious interpretations, could be a way forward. After all, the government doesn't intervene in religious practices like baptism, so it seems logical to treat marriage similarly. \n\nIf two people are committed to each other, their union should be legally recognized regardless of their religious beliefs.  The government shouldn't be involved in dictating the nature of a marriage, as long as it's a legally binding civil union.\n\nIdeally, a nationwide consensus on this issue would lead to federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage seems extreme. The constitution shouldn't be amended lightly, especially for something as personal and deeply held as marriage. While this is a significant issue for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic change to the fundamental law of the land.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully endorse that lifestyle. However, I believe marriage equality should be a right granted to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nI think this is a matter best decided at the state level rather than imposed nationally. Different states have diverse demographics and values, reflected in their political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states are more likely to support same-sex marriage, and residents within those states should have their voices heard on this issue.\n\nIf you choose to reside in a state that legalizes gay marriage, you're essentially accepting that state's stance.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equal opportunities for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community.  I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, but I feel it should be a decision made by individual states based on the will of their citizens. \n\nThe federal government shouldn't dictate this deeply personal issue for every state.  A president's personal views shouldn't determine the rights of citizens across the nation.  Furthermore, with the possibility of a change in presidential administration in the near future, this ongoing debate over a federal ban seems unproductive.\n\nAllowing states to decide on this issue allows for a more nuanced and respectful approach to this complex social topic.",
            "The concept of privacy in a digital world is complex, particularly when it intersects with school safety. While I understand the argument that accessing student profiles on platforms like Myspace constitutes an invasion of privacy, I believe the school's responsibility to ensure a secure learning environment should be paramount. \n\nStudents using public platforms should be aware that their online activity isn't entirely private.  If information posted online could potentially threaten the safety of the school community, it's reasonable for authorities to investigate.  \n\nThe school's actions, while perhaps appearing intrusive, are ultimately aimed at preventing harm.  Just as schools conduct drills to prepare for emergencies, they should utilize all available resources, including online monitoring, to mitigate potential threats.  \n\nFurthermore, the internet's permanence means that online posts can have lasting consequences.  Students should exercise caution and consider the potential repercussions of their online activity.  After all, actions have consequences, both online and offline.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective.  Initially, I strongly supported military intervention, feeling a sense of righteous anger and a need for retribution. However, as time passed, my views evolved. I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\nIt became clear to me that our response was largely driven by emotion rather than a well-thought-out plan. We entered the conflict unprepared, lacking a clear understanding of the complexities of the region and the potential ramifications of our involvement. This lack of preparedness has arguably backfired, exacerbating the situation and hindering progress towards peace and stability.\n\nI now believe that our continued presence in the region is counterproductive.  The internal conflicts and divisions among the local populations make it difficult to establish a lasting solution. It appears that our efforts to impose change have been met with resistance, and our presence may be contributing to further instability.\n\nIt's important to recognize that war is a brutal and complex issue, and there are no easy answers. While I understand the initial impulse to retaliate after the tragedies of 9/11, I now believe that a more nuanced and strategic approach is necessary. We need to prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and long-term solutions that address the root causes of instability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues is a contributing factor.  The Church's views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are considered traditional by some, but they may appear outdated to a younger generation.  \n\nMany people feel that the Church's rigid stance on these issues creates a sense of exclusion and discourages individuals who hold different beliefs. This disconnect can lead to disillusionment and a loss of faith. \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might find it difficult to reconcile their beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, someone who is gay or lesbian might feel unwelcome in a community that does not accept their relationship.\n\nThe Church's position on these matters hinders its ability to connect with a diverse and evolving society. Adopting a more inclusive and progressive approach might help the Church retain its relevance and attract new members.\n\nWhile some may argue that these are matters of faith and tradition, it is important to recognize that social norms and values are constantly changing. The Church should strive to engage with these changes and adapt its teachings accordingly to remain a relevant and meaningful institution.",
            "I believe that everyone deserves equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unjust to discriminate against individuals based on something they were born with.  \n\nDenying same-sex couples the right to marry sends a message that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships. This is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nI don't believe the federal government should intervene in personal matters like marriage.  It's a private decision between two consenting adults.  Government involvement in such matters seems unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nUltimately, I think it's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, and that includes supporting the right of same-sex couples to marry.",
            "Marriage equality is a matter of fundamental fairness. There isn't a valid reason to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections afforded to heterosexual couples.  \n\nSome argue that allowing same-sex marriage threatens the traditional family structure. However, this perspective overlooks the diversity of family forms and conflates marriage with a specific religious or social construct.  Marriage, at its core, is a legal and societal recognition of a committed relationship.  \n\nDenying marriage rights to same-sex couples creates significant legal and social inequalities. For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and taxation, partners in same-sex relationships often lack the same protections as married couples.  These disparities can have profound consequences for individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, many studies have demonstrated that same-sex relationships are just as stable and fulfilling as heterosexual relationships.  The factors contributing to relationship success are not determined by sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between religious beliefs and civil law.  While some religious institutions may oppose same-sex marriage, the government should uphold the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious views.  \n\nThe argument that same-sex marriage will negatively impact children is unfounded.  Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nOpposition to marriage equality often stems from prejudice and misinformation.  \n\nIt's crucial to rely on evidence-based research and to promote understanding and acceptance of all individuals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is a matter of social justice and equality for all.",
            "During my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I encountered a common misconception: the assumption that illegality automatically equates to inherent harm.  While I firmly believe drugs should not be readily available to the public, I do advocate for their medicinal use.  The legality of a substance does not dictate its potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, utilized in pharmacies for their proven medical benefits.  To deny those benefits simply because of societal stigma surrounding marijuana is illogical. We should embrace its potential therapeutic value.\n\nDrawing parallels to alcohol, while both substances can be misused, marijuana's potential for harm appears less severe.  A gradual integration of marijuana into a regulated system, rather than immediate legalization, might be prudent to mitigate potential abuse.  However, dismantling the negative stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to foster responsible use.\n\nThe perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug is largely driven by its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that its effects are not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting public perception and acknowledging its potential benefits, we can create a more informed and responsible approach to marijuana use, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "The church has definitely made some adjustments to better suit life in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back, when I was younger, church attendance was a regular Sunday ritual. I remember always dressing up—cute dresses, matching shoes and purses—the whole nine yards. That was the norm back then. Attending a private school meant seeing all my friends at church on weekends. We'd just go, you know, hang out.\n\nBut things have changed as I've gotten older. They've introduced a more casual \"teenager mass\" that's condensed to just thirty minutes. People dress a lot more relaxed now, especially in the summer when beachgoers might show up straight from the sand. Families often arrive late, adding to the laid-back vibe. Even at the morning masses, where I used to be quite formal, you see more jeans and khakis these days.  \n\nI'd say the biggest change is the shift towards casual attire. That's the most noticeable difference I've seen in my church. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about the internal politics of the church or anything like that.\n\nAs for the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't believe those things could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have inappropriate attractions towards children. I think it's about the individual, not their marital status. Becoming a priest is a personal choice. There are other religions, like those portrayed on TV shows, where clergy are allowed to marry. If someone deeply wants to practice their faith and be married, they could perhaps consider those alternatives.\n\nI think pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. It's not something people simply choose; it's more likely a biological predisposition.  While upbringing might play a role, I believe genetics are a major factor.  Marriage wouldn't hide that; it might even bring it to the surface eventually. \n\nIf the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's truly wrong. But I don't think they were always aware of everything.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War wasn't inherently problematic, but the context of the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow. It seemed the U.S. government used the tragedy as a springboard to justify pretexts for military action. The Bush administration made connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been debunked. This has deeply troubled me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions feel like a betrayal of the American public.  Even Colin Powell, who delivered a pivotal presentation at the UN, now acknowledges he lacked conviction in the presented evidence at the time. This, in my view, constitutes malfeasance and potentially impeachable offenses.  \n\nThe Bush administration's general disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11, is also deeply concerning.  There's a sense that they entered office with a preconceived notion of engaging in warfare. This is supported by allegations made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, who, after his departure from office, detailed this intent in his book.\n\nThe younger Bush appeared to harbor a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and perhaps sought to secure energy resources in the long term. This approach feels manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has undoubtedly dragged on too long, an immediate withdrawal could lead to further instability, potentially triggering a civil war with catastrophic consequences. The UN and the U.S. seem to be exploring an alternative: a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, this solution raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and future. The current interim government appears to be faltering, and the political process is fraught with tension.\n\nNews reports indicate the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable, with the Prime Minister seemingly lacking true control.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict with, now hold significant political power.  Radical factions continue to vie for control, exacerbating the political climate.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue. Its origin can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11, with many believing it was a response to the terrorist attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has sparked debate about its legitimacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to form a definitive stance on the war. While I understand the desire to combat terrorism and promote democracy, I am also concerned about the long-term consequences of our involvement. The war has had a profound impact on Iraqi society, leading to instability and displacement. \n\nThe complexities of establishing a functioning democracy in a nation with a long history of authoritarian rule are significant. Furthermore, the presence of foreign troops can exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment, potentially hindering the establishment of lasting peace.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the human cost of war, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The economic burden on the United States is also a factor. While the stated goals of the war may be noble, it's essential to analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs. \n\nUltimately, finding a resolution to the conflict that promotes stability, justice, and self-determination for the Iraqi people remains a significant challenge.",
            "The issue of  legality surrounding this particular topic is one that I believe should remain with religious institutions. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a fundamental cornerstone of our nation, clearly outlining the boundaries between governmental authority and religious practice. \n\nAny attempt by the government to impose its will on this matter would be a direct violation of this established principle. It would essentially amount to choosing one religious viewpoint over another, which is not the role of the government. While certain denominations may hold strong convictions against this practice, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs within various faiths.\n\nFurthermore, the very concept of amending the Constitution to address this issue raises serious concerns.  Amending such a foundational document should be reserved for matters of utmost national importance, not for addressing the specific tenets of individual religions. Additionally, an amendment aimed at restricting this practice would be unprecedented, as most amendments serve to limit governmental power rather than individual freedoms.\n\nI firmly believe that this matter should be left to the guidance and discretion of religious organizations. The government has no place in dictating the internal affairs of churches or other religious bodies.  It's essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom and allow each faith to determine its own stance on this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq remains a complex and deeply troubling issue. From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency. While the tragic events of September 11th understandably fueled a desire for action, the connection between those attacks and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best. This, I fear, was exploited to manipulate public sentiment.\n\nPersonally, I am fundamentally opposed to preemptive war. The Iraq conflict, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War. The immense loss of American lives is a devastating consequence, and the unintended consequences of removing a nation's leadership were poorly anticipated. The subsequent power vacuum created instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges faced in Vietnam.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic system in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved far more complex than initially envisioned. Just as the US struggled to solidify democracy in its own history, imposing a new political structure on another nation demands patience and a realistic understanding of the long-term commitment required. \n\nThe initial optimism surrounding the invasion seems misplaced, overlooking the inherent difficulties of nation-building.  The ongoing presence of US troops, the continued training of Iraqi security forces, and the persistent threat of insurgency highlight the enduring complexities of the situation. \n\nFurthermore, the question of motive arises. While the stated goal was to spread democracy, the significant oil reserves of Iraq cannot be ignored. The lack of conclusive evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the continued reliance on oil from the region, raises concerns about the transparency and genuine motivations behind the conflict.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is a stark reminder of the profound consequences of war, both for those directly involved and for the international community. I hope for a swift and peaceful resolution, but acknowledge the grim reality that lasting stability may be elusive.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and evidence increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has biological roots rather than purely sociological ones.  Denying individuals rights based on something they cannot control is fundamentally unjust. \n\nI believe personal relationships, including marriage, should be private matters, free from government interference. Politics and legislation have no place in dictating who can and cannot love whom.  Observing diverse families in my own community, such as openly gay couples who live and function just like any other family, reinforces this belief.\n\nRecent studies and reports indicate that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors, potentially even predisposed at birth. This further strengthens the argument against societal or legal restrictions. \n\nThe double standard surrounding marriage is stark. Heterosexual couples can choose to marry privately, while same-sex couples face public scrutiny and legal barriers. This discrepancy highlights the need for equal rights and recognition for all loving couples.  Marriage should be a personal and private matter, not subject to political or national regulations.",
            "The internet operates as a public platform, meaning anything shared there is accessible to a broad audience. As a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts have significantly influenced perceptions of individuals.  \n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential consequences of what we share online. Posts about sensitive topics, such as violence or threats, can be misinterpreted and lead to serious repercussions. \n\nWhile it's natural to express ourselves freely, it's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact.  One never knows who might see what we post, and even seemingly harmless content can be taken out of context.\n\nThere are instances where concerns raised about online activity are legitimate, such as when a student's posts express potential danger to themselves or others. In such cases, school officials may need to investigate to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nHowever, it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy. Blindly monitoring students' online activity without proper justification is a breach of trust.  \n\nUltimately, individuals should be mindful of their online presence and understand that their digital footprint can have lasting consequences.",
            "The conflict has undoubtedly persisted for an excessive duration. While the initial intent, aimed at establishing democratic principles in a nation lacking a fair political system, appeared noble, I believe we have strayed from that original objective. \n\nIt seems we might be engaged in the war simply to assert our global dominance, a pursuit that raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the war's genesis could be linked to pre-existing tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein, casting a shadow of doubt on the initial motivations. \n\nIf the goal truly was to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, the war's legitimacy diminishes considerably. \n\nRegardless, the conflict has dragged on far too long. The initial military action, while forceful, conveyed a clear message. However, the prolonged engagement, spanning several years, has lost its initial purpose. \n\nIf our aim was to liberate a nation from tyranny, that was a worthy goal. But over time, I fear our objectives have become muddled and misguided. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a lasting resolution. \n\nThe war's financial burden is also a significant concern. Billions are being poured into a conflict that has outlived its usefulness. These resources could be better allocated to addressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other pressing social needs. \n\nIt's time to end this war. The Iraqi government and its officials must ultimately take responsibility for their own nation. We have fulfilled our initial purpose and should prioritize our own citizens' well-being.",
            "The concept of online privacy is a complex one. While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, the question of to what extent schools can regulate students' online activities is debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, students who choose to share personal information online should be aware that it may be viewed by a wider audience. This includes potential risks, such as encountering individuals with malicious intent.  The example of the man who used online information to manipulate a young woman highlights the dangers that can arise from readily accessible personal data.\n\nHowever, banning social media entirely seems like a heavy-handed approach.  Students need to learn how to navigate the digital world responsibly, and outright prohibition may not be the most effective solution.  It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom and the school's responsibility to protect its students.\n\nPerhaps a more nuanced approach would involve educating students about online safety and privacy best practices, rather than resorting to blanket bans. This could empower them to make informed decisions about their online presence and minimize potential risks.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue, and my initial stance against it aligns with the prevailing public opinion, which overwhelmingly considers it a mistake.  \n\nSurveys conducted across the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a consistent sentiment:  a significant majority, ranging from seventy-five to eighty percent, believe the war was a poor decision. This includes a large portion of U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, who also express a desire for withdrawal within a year.\n\nThe conflict has undeniably been a source of turmoil since its inception, and the prospect of withdrawal presents its own set of challenges.  The Middle East's cultural complexities and differing values pose significant obstacles to achieving lasting stability through direct intervention.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive,  the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential consequences, which have unfolded as a multifaceted disaster.  \n\nDespite the administration's justifications for remaining in Iraq, I find them unconvincing. A gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer might be more manageable, but the fundamental question remains:  what legitimate reason compels us to remain beyond that point?  \n\nThe Iraqi people themselves have voiced their desire for our departure, with a significant portion advocating for immediate withdrawal. Their perspectives, as those most directly affected, deserve considerable weight. \n\nLeaving Iraq while acknowledging their autonomy, even if it leads to unforeseen challenges, could ultimately be more ethically sound than continuing a protracted presence that is increasingly viewed as detrimental by both the Iraqi people and a large segment of the American public.",
            "Gender discrimination persists in the United States, although it's not limited to women. The specific field of work often plays a significant role. While women generally face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also encounter prejudice. For instance, societal expectations often pressure men to be the primary breadwinner, leading to judgment when they choose to stay home with children.\n\nSimilarly, the fashion industry presents unique hurdles for men. They may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable about fashion if they don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. This highlights how deeply ingrained societal norms can influence perceptions and opportunities, regardless of gender.\n\nProgress has been made in challenging these discriminatory practices. Women are increasingly attaining leadership positions, and the acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is growing. However, change is gradual. By highlighting the strengths and experiences of those who are often stereotyped, and by promoting inclusivity, we can continue to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society.  \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that discrimination can extend beyond gender. Factors like socioeconomic background and education level can also play a role. For example, someone with exceptional intelligence but limited formal education might face prejudice based on their communication style. This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of discrimination and the need for a holistic approach to addressing it.",
            "The legalization debate around marijuana is complex. While it hasn't been fully legalized in all areas, many places have chosen to decriminalize it. This means that possession of small amounts is treated less severely than a criminal offense, akin to a traffic violation.  \n\nWhile decriminalization does lessen the immediate legal repercussions, concerns remain about the long-term consequences.  A criminal record, even for a minor offense, can still impact job prospects and other opportunities. \n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the financial burden of arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is substantial.  They contend that these resources could be better allocated to areas like education, social programs, and public health. \n\nUrban centers with progressive viewpoints, like Denver, have often taken this approach, believing that decriminalization can free up funds for essential services.  \n\nThe debate also touches on the social implications of marijuana use. Some worry that full legalization might lead to increased public consumption, potentially impacting social norms and safety. It raises questions about the regulation and control of marijuana sales and its accessibility to minors.\n\nUltimately, the debate revolves around balancing individual liberties with societal concerns, weighing the potential benefits of decriminalization against the perceived risks of increased usage and its impact on communities.",
            "My perspective on the Catholic Church is complex. While I appreciate its enduring traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's approach to inclusivity.  While the teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices seem to contradict this message. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage was not permitted in the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian faith. This experience highlighted what I perceive as a lack of tolerance towards those outside the Catholic tradition. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that the Church's strict adherence to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion for those who don't perfectly align with its tenets. This rigidity, coupled with a resistance to change, can be discouraging for individuals seeking a more welcoming and understanding faith community. \n\nI recognize that the issue of priestly celibacy is a sensitive one, and I understand the arguments both for and against it. While allowing priests to marry might address certain concerns, I believe the root cause of misconduct lies within individuals and not solely within their marital status.  The problem of abuse is a serious one that requires multifaceted solutions, and addressing it effectively necessitates a focus on accountability, prevention, and support for survivors.",
            "This issue is incredibly complex, and I haven't fully formed my opinion on it yet. It's difficult to definitively say which side is right or wrong because it touches on such sensitive areas like the separation of church and state and the very definition of marriage. \n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's beliefs while ensuring fairness is a significant challenge.  \n\nPersonally, I believe civil unions should be recognized and respected.  Perhaps defining marriage as solely a civil contract, separate from religious interpretations, could be a way forward. After all, the government doesn't intervene in religious practices like baptism, so it seems logical to treat marriage similarly. \n\nIf two people are committed to each other, their union should be legally recognized regardless of their religious beliefs.  The government shouldn't be involved in dictating the nature of a marriage, as long as it's a legally binding civil union.\n\nIdeally, a nationwide consensus on this issue would lead to federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage seems extreme. The constitution shouldn't be amended lightly, especially for something as personal and deeply held as marriage. While this is a significant issue for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic change to the fundamental law of the land.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully endorse that lifestyle. However, I believe marriage equality should be a right granted to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nI think this is a matter best decided at the state level rather than imposed nationally. Different states have diverse demographics and values, reflected in their political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states are more likely to support same-sex marriage, and residents within those states should have their voices heard on this issue.\n\nIf you choose to reside in a state that legalizes gay marriage, you're essentially accepting that state's stance.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equal opportunities for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community.  I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, but I feel it should be a decision made by individual states based on the will of their citizens. \n\nThe federal government shouldn't dictate this deeply personal issue for every state.  A president's personal views shouldn't determine the rights of citizens across the nation.  Furthermore, with the possibility of a change in presidential administration in the near future, this ongoing debate over a federal ban seems unproductive.\n\nAllowing states to decide on this issue allows for a more nuanced and respectful approach to this complex social topic.",
            "The concept of privacy in a digital world is complex, particularly when it intersects with school safety. While I understand the argument that accessing student profiles on platforms like Myspace constitutes an invasion of privacy, I believe the school's responsibility to ensure a secure learning environment should be paramount. \n\nStudents using public platforms should be aware that their online activity isn't entirely private.  If information posted online could potentially threaten the safety of the school community, it's reasonable for authorities to investigate.  \n\nThe school's actions, while perhaps appearing intrusive, are ultimately aimed at preventing harm.  Just as schools conduct drills to prepare for emergencies, they should utilize all available resources, including online monitoring, to mitigate potential threats.  \n\nFurthermore, the internet's permanence means that online posts can have lasting consequences.  Students should exercise caution and consider the potential repercussions of their online activity.  After all, actions have consequences, both online and offline.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective.  Initially, I strongly supported military intervention, feeling a sense of righteous anger and a need for retribution. However, as time passed, my views evolved. I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\nIt became clear to me that our response was largely driven by emotion rather than a well-thought-out plan. We entered the conflict unprepared, lacking a clear understanding of the complexities of the region and the potential ramifications of our involvement. This lack of preparedness has arguably backfired, exacerbating the situation and hindering progress towards peace and stability.\n\nI now believe that our continued presence in the region is counterproductive.  The internal conflicts and divisions among the local populations make it difficult to establish a lasting solution. It appears that our efforts to impose change have been met with resistance, and our presence may be contributing to further instability.\n\nIt's important to recognize that war is a brutal and complex issue, and there are no easy answers. While I understand the initial impulse to retaliate after the tragedies of 9/11, I now believe that a more nuanced and strategic approach is necessary. We need to prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and long-term solutions that address the root causes of instability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues is a contributing factor.  The Church's views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control are considered traditional by some, but they may appear outdated to a younger generation.  \n\nMany people feel that the Church's rigid stance on these issues creates a sense of exclusion and discourages individuals who hold different beliefs. This disconnect can lead to disillusionment and a loss of faith. \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might find it difficult to reconcile their beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, someone who is gay or lesbian might feel unwelcome in a community that does not accept their relationship.\n\nThe Church's position on these matters hinders its ability to connect with a diverse and evolving society. Adopting a more inclusive and progressive approach might help the Church retain its relevance and attract new members.\n\nWhile some may argue that these are matters of faith and tradition, it is important to recognize that social norms and values are constantly changing. The Church should strive to engage with these changes and adapt its teachings accordingly to remain a relevant and meaningful institution.",
            "I believe that everyone deserves equal rights and opportunities, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unjust to discriminate against individuals based on something they were born with.  \n\nDenying same-sex couples the right to marry sends a message that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships. This is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nI don't believe the federal government should intervene in personal matters like marriage.  It's a private decision between two consenting adults.  Government involvement in such matters seems unnecessary and intrusive.\n\nUltimately, I think it's important to treat all people with respect and dignity, and that includes supporting the right of same-sex couples to marry.",
            "Marriage equality is a matter of fundamental fairness. There isn't a valid reason to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights and protections afforded to heterosexual couples.  \n\nSome argue that allowing same-sex marriage threatens the traditional family structure. However, this perspective overlooks the diversity of family forms and conflates marriage with a specific religious or social construct.  Marriage, at its core, is a legal and societal recognition of a committed relationship.  \n\nDenying marriage rights to same-sex couples creates significant legal and social inequalities. For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and taxation, partners in same-sex relationships often lack the same protections as married couples.  These disparities can have profound consequences for individuals and families.\n\nFurthermore, many studies have demonstrated that same-sex relationships are just as stable and fulfilling as heterosexual relationships.  The factors contributing to relationship success are not determined by sexual orientation.\n\nIt's important to distinguish between religious beliefs and civil law.  While some religious institutions may oppose same-sex marriage, the government should uphold the rights of all citizens regardless of their religious views.  \n\nThe argument that same-sex marriage will negatively impact children is unfounded.  Children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents.  \n\nOpposition to marriage equality often stems from prejudice and misinformation.  \n\nIt's crucial to rely on evidence-based research and to promote understanding and acceptance of all individuals.  Legalizing same-sex marriage is a matter of social justice and equality for all.",
            "During my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I encountered a common misconception: the assumption that illegality automatically equates to inherent harm.  While I firmly believe drugs should not be readily available to the public, I do advocate for their medicinal use.  The legality of a substance does not dictate its potential therapeutic benefits.\n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, utilized in pharmacies for their proven medical benefits.  To deny those benefits simply because of societal stigma surrounding marijuana is illogical. We should embrace its potential therapeutic value.\n\nDrawing parallels to alcohol, while both substances can be misused, marijuana's potential for harm appears less severe.  A gradual integration of marijuana into a regulated system, rather than immediate legalization, might be prudent to mitigate potential abuse.  However, dismantling the negative stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to foster responsible use.\n\nThe perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug is largely driven by its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that its effects are not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting public perception and acknowledging its potential benefits, we can create a more informed and responsible approach to marijuana use, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "The church has definitely made some adjustments to better suit life in the twenty-first century. It's not as rigid as it used to be. Looking back, when I was younger, church attendance was a regular Sunday ritual. I remember always dressing up—cute dresses, matching shoes and purses—the whole nine yards. That was the norm back then. Attending a private school meant seeing all my friends at church on weekends. We'd just go, you know, hang out.\n\nBut things have changed as I've gotten older. They've introduced a more casual \"teenager mass\" that's condensed to just thirty minutes. People dress a lot more relaxed now, especially in the summer when beachgoers might show up straight from the sand. Families often arrive late, adding to the laid-back vibe. Even at the morning masses, where I used to be quite formal, you see more jeans and khakis these days.  \n\nI'd say the biggest change is the shift towards casual attire. That's the most noticeable difference I've seen in my church. \n\nTo be honest, I don't know much about the internal politics of the church or anything like that.\n\nAs for the accusations of pedophilia against Catholic priests, I don't believe those things could have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and they still have inappropriate attractions towards children. I think it's about the individual, not their marital status. Becoming a priest is a personal choice. There are other religions, like those portrayed on TV shows, where clergy are allowed to marry. If someone deeply wants to practice their faith and be married, they could perhaps consider those alternatives.\n\nI think pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. It's not something people simply choose; it's more likely a biological predisposition.  While upbringing might play a role, I believe genetics are a major factor.  Marriage wouldn't hide that; it might even bring it to the surface eventually. \n\nIf the church knew about these cases and tried to cover them up, that's truly wrong. But I don't think they were always aware of everything.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War wasn't inherently problematic, but the context of the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow. It seemed the U.S. government used the tragedy as a springboard to justify pretexts for military action. The Bush administration made connections between Saddam Hussein, Osama Bin Laden, and the 9/11 attacks, claiming he possessed weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been debunked. This has deeply troubled me.\n\nThe Bush administration's actions feel like a betrayal of the American public.  Even Colin Powell, who delivered a pivotal presentation at the UN, now acknowledges he lacked conviction in the presented evidence at the time. This, in my view, constitutes malfeasance and potentially impeachable offenses.  \n\nThe Bush administration's general disregard for the Constitution, particularly since 9/11, is also deeply concerning.  There's a sense that they entered office with a preconceived notion of engaging in warfare. This is supported by allegations made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, who, after his departure from office, detailed this intent in his book.\n\nThe younger Bush appeared to harbor a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and perhaps sought to secure energy resources in the long term. This approach feels manipulative and underhanded.\n\nWhile the war has undoubtedly dragged on too long, an immediate withdrawal could lead to further instability, potentially triggering a civil war with catastrophic consequences. The UN and the U.S. seem to be exploring an alternative: a coalition of neighboring nations, like Syria and Saudi Arabia, to restore order. However, this solution raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and future. The current interim government appears to be faltering, and the political process is fraught with tension.\n\nNews reports indicate the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable, with the Prime Minister seemingly lacking true control.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict with, now hold significant political power.  Radical factions continue to vie for control, exacerbating the political climate.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue. Its origin can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11, with many believing it was a response to the terrorist attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has sparked debate about its legitimacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it difficult to form a definitive stance on the war. While I understand the desire to combat terrorism and promote democracy, I am also concerned about the long-term consequences of our involvement. The war has had a profound impact on Iraqi society, leading to instability and displacement. \n\nThe complexities of establishing a functioning democracy in a nation with a long history of authoritarian rule are significant. Furthermore, the presence of foreign troops can exacerbate tensions and fuel resentment, potentially hindering the establishment of lasting peace.\n\nIt's crucial to consider the human cost of war, both for Iraqi civilians and American soldiers. The economic burden on the United States is also a factor. While the stated goals of the war may be noble, it's essential to analyze whether the benefits outweigh the costs. \n\nUltimately, finding a resolution to the conflict that promotes stability, justice, and self-determination for the Iraqi people remains a significant challenge.",
            "The issue of  legality surrounding this particular topic is one that I believe should remain with religious institutions. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a fundamental cornerstone of our nation, clearly outlining the boundaries between governmental authority and religious practice. \n\nAny attempt by the government to impose its will on this matter would be a direct violation of this established principle. It would essentially amount to choosing one religious viewpoint over another, which is not the role of the government. While certain denominations may hold strong convictions against this practice, it is important to recognize the diversity of beliefs within various faiths.\n\nFurthermore, the very concept of amending the Constitution to address this issue raises serious concerns.  Amending such a foundational document should be reserved for matters of utmost national importance, not for addressing the specific tenets of individual religions. Additionally, an amendment aimed at restricting this practice would be unprecedented, as most amendments serve to limit governmental power rather than individual freedoms.\n\nI firmly believe that this matter should be left to the guidance and discretion of religious organizations. The government has no place in dictating the internal affairs of churches or other religious bodies.  It's essential to uphold the principle of religious freedom and allow each faith to determine its own stance on this issue.",
            "The conflict in Iraq remains a complex and deeply troubling issue. From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the invasion lacked transparency. While the tragic events of September 11th understandably fueled a desire for action, the connection between those attacks and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best. This, I fear, was exploited to manipulate public sentiment.\n\nPersonally, I am fundamentally opposed to preemptive war. The Iraq conflict, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War. The immense loss of American lives is a devastating consequence, and the unintended consequences of removing a nation's leadership were poorly anticipated. The subsequent power vacuum created instability and chaos, mirroring the challenges faced in Vietnam.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic system in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved far more complex than initially envisioned. Just as the US struggled to solidify democracy in its own history, imposing a new political structure on another nation demands patience and a realistic understanding of the long-term commitment required. \n\nThe initial optimism surrounding the invasion seems misplaced, overlooking the inherent difficulties of nation-building.  The ongoing presence of US troops, the continued training of Iraqi security forces, and the persistent threat of insurgency highlight the enduring complexities of the situation. \n\nFurthermore, the question of motive arises. While the stated goal was to spread democracy, the significant oil reserves of Iraq cannot be ignored. The lack of conclusive evidence regarding weapons of mass destruction, coupled with the continued reliance on oil from the region, raises concerns about the transparency and genuine motivations behind the conflict.\n\nThe situation in Iraq is a stark reminder of the profound consequences of war, both for those directly involved and for the international community. I hope for a swift and peaceful resolution, but acknowledge the grim reality that lasting stability may be elusive.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and evidence increasingly suggests that sexual orientation has biological roots rather than purely sociological ones.  Denying individuals rights based on something they cannot control is fundamentally unjust. \n\nI believe personal relationships, including marriage, should be private matters, free from government interference. Politics and legislation have no place in dictating who can and cannot love whom.  Observing diverse families in my own community, such as openly gay couples who live and function just like any other family, reinforces this belief.\n\nRecent studies and reports indicate that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors, potentially even predisposed at birth. This further strengthens the argument against societal or legal restrictions. \n\nThe double standard surrounding marriage is stark. Heterosexual couples can choose to marry privately, while same-sex couples face public scrutiny and legal barriers. This discrepancy highlights the need for equal rights and recognition for all loving couples.  Marriage should be a personal and private matter, not subject to political or national regulations.",
            "The internet operates as a public platform, meaning anything shared there is accessible to a broad audience. As a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts have significantly influenced perceptions of individuals.  \n\nIt's crucial to consider the potential consequences of what we share online. Posts about sensitive topics, such as violence or threats, can be misinterpreted and lead to serious repercussions. \n\nWhile it's natural to express ourselves freely, it's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact.  One never knows who might see what we post, and even seemingly harmless content can be taken out of context.\n\nThere are instances where concerns raised about online activity are legitimate, such as when a student's posts express potential danger to themselves or others. In such cases, school officials may need to investigate to ensure everyone's safety. \n\nHowever, it's equally important to respect individuals' privacy. Blindly monitoring students' online activity without proper justification is a breach of trust.  \n\nUltimately, individuals should be mindful of their online presence and understand that their digital footprint can have lasting consequences.",
            "The conflict has undoubtedly persisted for an excessive duration. While the initial intent, aimed at establishing democratic principles in a nation lacking a fair political system, appeared noble, I believe we have strayed from that original objective. \n\nIt seems we might be engaged in the war simply to assert our global dominance, a pursuit that raises ethical concerns. Furthermore, the war's genesis could be linked to pre-existing tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein, casting a shadow of doubt on the initial motivations. \n\nIf the goal truly was to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, the war's legitimacy diminishes considerably. \n\nRegardless, the conflict has dragged on far too long. The initial military action, while forceful, conveyed a clear message. However, the prolonged engagement, spanning several years, has lost its initial purpose. \n\nIf our aim was to liberate a nation from tyranny, that was a worthy goal. But over time, I fear our objectives have become muddled and misguided. We seem to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a decisive victory rather than a lasting resolution. \n\nThe war's financial burden is also a significant concern. Billions are being poured into a conflict that has outlived its usefulness. These resources could be better allocated to addressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, education, healthcare, and other pressing social needs. \n\nIt's time to end this war. The Iraqi government and its officials must ultimately take responsibility for their own nation. We have fulfilled our initial purpose and should prioritize our own citizens' well-being.",
            "The concept of online privacy is a complex one. While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, the question of to what extent schools can regulate students' online activities is debatable.\n\nOn the one hand, students who choose to share personal information online should be aware that it may be viewed by a wider audience. This includes potential risks, such as encountering individuals with malicious intent.  The example of the man who used online information to manipulate a young woman highlights the dangers that can arise from readily accessible personal data.\n\nHowever, banning social media entirely seems like a heavy-handed approach.  Students need to learn how to navigate the digital world responsibly, and outright prohibition may not be the most effective solution.  It raises questions about the balance between individual freedom and the school's responsibility to protect its students.\n\nPerhaps a more nuanced approach would involve educating students about online safety and privacy best practices, rather than resorting to blanket bans. This could empower them to make informed decisions about their online presence and minimize potential risks.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue, and my initial stance against it aligns with the prevailing public opinion, which overwhelmingly considers it a mistake.  \n\nSurveys conducted across the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a consistent sentiment:  a significant majority, ranging from seventy-five to eighty percent, believe the war was a poor decision. This includes a large portion of U.S. troops currently stationed in Iraq, who also express a desire for withdrawal within a year.\n\nThe conflict has undeniably been a source of turmoil since its inception, and the prospect of withdrawal presents its own set of challenges.  The Middle East's cultural complexities and differing values pose significant obstacles to achieving lasting stability through direct intervention.  \n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly oppressive,  the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential consequences, which have unfolded as a multifaceted disaster.  \n\nDespite the administration's justifications for remaining in Iraq, I find them unconvincing. A gradual withdrawal over a year or slightly longer might be more manageable, but the fundamental question remains:  what legitimate reason compels us to remain beyond that point?  \n\nThe Iraqi people themselves have voiced their desire for our departure, with a significant portion advocating for immediate withdrawal. Their perspectives, as those most directly affected, deserve considerable weight. \n\nLeaving Iraq while acknowledging their autonomy, even if it leads to unforeseen challenges, could ultimately be more ethically sound than continuing a protracted presence that is increasingly viewed as detrimental by both the Iraqi people and a large segment of the American public.",
            "Gender discrimination persists in the United States, although it's not limited to women. The specific field of work often plays a significant role. While women generally face more challenges due to the \"glass ceiling,\" men can also encounter prejudice. For instance, societal expectations often pressure men to be the primary breadwinner, leading to judgment when they choose to stay home with children.\n\nSimilarly, the fashion industry presents unique hurdles for men. They may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable about fashion if they don't conform to traditional masculine stereotypes. This highlights how deeply ingrained societal norms can influence perceptions and opportunities, regardless of gender.\n\nProgress has been made in challenging these discriminatory practices. Women are increasingly attaining leadership positions, and the acceptance of stay-at-home fathers is growing. However, change is gradual. By highlighting the strengths and experiences of those who are often stereotyped, and by promoting inclusivity, we can continue to dismantle these barriers and create a more equitable society.  \n\nIt's important to acknowledge that discrimination can extend beyond gender. Factors like socioeconomic background and education level can also play a role. For example, someone with exceptional intelligence but limited formal education might face prejudice based on their communication style. This emphasizes the multifaceted nature of discrimination and the need for a holistic approach to addressing it.",
            "The legalization debate around marijuana is complex. While it hasn't been fully legalized in all areas, many places have chosen to decriminalize it. This means that possession of small amounts is treated less severely than a criminal offense, akin to a traffic violation.  \n\nWhile decriminalization does lessen the immediate legal repercussions, concerns remain about the long-term consequences.  A criminal record, even for a minor offense, can still impact job prospects and other opportunities. \n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the financial burden of arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession is substantial.  They contend that these resources could be better allocated to areas like education, social programs, and public health. \n\nUrban centers with progressive viewpoints, like Denver, have often taken this approach, believing that decriminalization can free up funds for essential services.  \n\nThe debate also touches on the social implications of marijuana use. Some worry that full legalization might lead to increased public consumption, potentially impacting social norms and safety. It raises questions about the regulation and control of marijuana sales and its accessibility to minors.\n\nUltimately, the debate revolves around balancing individual liberties with societal concerns, weighing the potential benefits of decriminalization against the perceived risks of increased usage and its impact on communities.",
            "My perspective on the Catholic Church is complex. While I appreciate its enduring traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's approach to inclusivity.  While the teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices seem to contradict this message. For instance, my parents' interfaith marriage was not permitted in the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian faith. This experience highlighted what I perceive as a lack of tolerance towards those outside the Catholic tradition. \n\nFurthermore, I feel that the Church's strict adherence to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion for those who don't perfectly align with its tenets. This rigidity, coupled with a resistance to change, can be discouraging for individuals seeking a more welcoming and understanding faith community. \n\nI recognize that the issue of priestly celibacy is a sensitive one, and I understand the arguments both for and against it. While allowing priests to marry might address certain concerns, I believe the root cause of misconduct lies within individuals and not solely within their marital status.  The problem of abuse is a serious one that requires multifaceted solutions, and addressing it effectively necessitates a focus on accountability, prevention, and support for survivors.",
            "This issue is incredibly complex, and I haven't fully formed my opinion on it yet. It's difficult to definitively say which side is right or wrong because it touches on such sensitive areas like the separation of church and state and the very definition of marriage. \n\nFinding a solution that respects everyone's beliefs while ensuring fairness is a significant challenge.  \n\nPersonally, I believe civil unions should be recognized and respected.  Perhaps defining marriage as solely a civil contract, separate from religious interpretations, could be a way forward. After all, the government doesn't intervene in religious practices like baptism, so it seems logical to treat marriage similarly. \n\nIf two people are committed to each other, their union should be legally recognized regardless of their religious beliefs.  The government shouldn't be involved in dictating the nature of a marriage, as long as it's a legally binding civil union.\n\nIdeally, a nationwide consensus on this issue would lead to federal legislation. However, a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage seems extreme. The constitution shouldn't be amended lightly, especially for something as personal and deeply held as marriage. While this is a significant issue for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic change to the fundamental law of the land.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, my views on homosexuality are complex. While I value my many gay friends, I personally don't fully endorse that lifestyle. However, I believe marriage equality should be a right granted to all individuals, regardless of sexual orientation.  \n\nI think this is a matter best decided at the state level rather than imposed nationally. Different states have diverse demographics and values, reflected in their political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states are more likely to support same-sex marriage, and residents within those states should have their voices heard on this issue.\n\nIf you choose to reside in a state that legalizes gay marriage, you're essentially accepting that state's stance.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equal opportunities for everyone, including the LGBTQ+ community.  I support the legalization of same-sex marriage, but I feel it should be a decision made by individual states based on the will of their citizens. \n\nThe federal government shouldn't dictate this deeply personal issue for every state.  A president's personal views shouldn't determine the rights of citizens across the nation.  Furthermore, with the possibility of a change in presidential administration in the near future, this ongoing debate over a federal ban seems unproductive.\n\nAllowing states to decide on this issue allows for a more nuanced and respectful approach to this complex social topic.",
            "The concept of privacy in a digital world is complex, particularly when it intersects with school safety. While I understand the argument that accessing student profiles on platforms like Myspace constitutes an invasion of privacy, I believe the school's responsibility to ensure a secure learning environment should be paramount. \n\nStudents using public platforms should be aware that their online activity isn't entirely private.  If information posted online could potentially threaten the safety of the school community, it's reasonable for authorities to investigate.  \n\nThe school's actions, while perhaps appearing intrusive, are ultimately aimed at preventing harm.  Just as schools conduct drills to prepare for emergencies, they should utilize all available resources, including online monitoring, to mitigate potential threats.  \n\nFurthermore, the internet's permanence means that online posts can have lasting consequences.  Students should exercise caution and consider the potential repercussions of their online activity.  After all, actions have consequences, both online and offline.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective.  Initially, I strongly supported military intervention, feeling a sense of righteous anger and a need for retribution. However, as time passed, my views evolved. I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions and the effectiveness of our strategy. \n\nIt became clear to me that our response was largely driven by emotion rather than a well-thought-out plan. We entered the conflict unprepared, lacking a clear understanding of the complexities of the region and the potential ramifications of our involvement. This lack of preparedness has arguably backfired, exacerbating the situation and hindering progress towards peace and stability.\n\nI now believe that our continued presence in the region is counterproductive.  The internal conflicts and divisions among the local populations make it difficult to establish a lasting solution. It appears that our efforts to impose change have been met with resistance, and our presence may be contributing to further instability.\n\nIt's important to recognize that war is a brutal and complex issue, and there are no easy answers. While I understand the initial impulse to retaliate after the tragedies of 9/11, I now believe that a more nuanced and strategic approach is necessary. We need to prioritize diplomacy, conflict resolution, and long-term solutions that address the root causes of instability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe this can be partly attributed to its stance on certain social issues.  While the Church holds strong convictions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, these views are perceived by some as outdated.  \n\nA more contemporary approach to these matters might help the Church retain its following. I've heard that many individuals are distancing themselves from the Catholic Church due to disagreements with its positions on these issues.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a community that condemns it. Similarly, individuals who advocate for same-sex marriage might find the Church's stance on this issue incompatible with their beliefs. \n\nPersonally, I believe the Church should reconsider its strict regulations regarding female priests and married clergy.  \n\nWhile these changes may not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more inclusive and welcoming environment. After all, many other professions allow individuals to balance their personal lives with their work commitments.\n\nI think it's important for the Church to adapt to the evolving values of society.",
            "I personally don't have any objections to same-sex marriage.  I believe sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, not a choice.  Therefore, individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry, while allowing heterosexual couples to, seems discriminatory.  \n\nWhile I haven't extensively researched the topic, I strongly feel that it's unjust to limit marriage rights based on sexual orientation. People are born with different characteristics, including their sexual orientation, just as some are born left-handed and others right-handed.  It's not a decision anyone consciously makes.  \n\nI also believe that the federal government's role in this matter is limited. Marriage is a personal and societal institution, not a matter of national security or morality.  Government interference in such deeply personal choices feels inappropriate. It's important to respect individual autonomy and allow people to live their lives authentically without facing discrimination.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears. \n\nOne common concern is that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, the concept of \"family\" is diverse and evolving.  Just as heterosexual relationships vary widely, so do same-sex relationships.  The core elements of love, commitment, and shared responsibility transcend sexual orientation. \n\nLegal recognition of same-sex marriage is crucial for ensuring equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples.  This includes matters like property ownership, healthcare decisions, and inheritance. Denying these rights to same-sex couples creates a system of second-class citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that same-sex marriage violates religious beliefs is misplaced. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy.  While individuals are free to hold religious convictions, these beliefs should not dictate public policy that affects the rights of all citizens.\n\nOpponents often cite concerns about the impact of same-sex parenting on children.  However, extensive research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents.  The well-being of a child depends on the quality of the relationship they have with their parents, not their sexual orientation. \n\nUltimately, the fight for marriage equality is about basic human dignity and the right to live authentically.  It's about recognizing that love is love, regardless of who it is between.",
            "My summer job in a hospital pharmacy has given me a unique perspective on the complexities surrounding drug legality. While I understand the concerns about making certain substances readily available to the public, I believe a distinction should be made between recreational use and medicinal applications. \n\nThere are numerous drugs, even those classified as controlled substances, that are vital for therapeutic purposes within a medical setting.  Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples.  Denying access to potentially beneficial substances solely based on social stigma, as opposed to their inherent properties, seems illogical. \n\nThe debate surrounding marijuana is often clouded by misconceptions. While its potential for abuse exists, so does the potential for alcohol, which is legal.  A gradual approach to legalization, coupled with continued research and education, could help mitigate potential risks while allowing for responsible use and exploration of its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction.  Marijuana is not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine in terms of its potential for harm. By challenging the prevailing perception, we can create a more informed and nuanced conversation about its potential medical applications and responsible use.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to fit modern times. It's not as rigidly structured as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest: matching dresses, shoes, and purse. It was a part of my routine, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my classmates there on weekends. \n\nHowever, things have changed. The church now offers a mass specifically for teenagers, which is shorter and more casual.  People dress down more, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Families often arrive late, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. Even at the traditional morning masses, where I used to dress up, now people are more comfortable wearing jeans and khakis. \n\nThis shift towards casualness is the most noticeable change I've observed in the church. While I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this is the aspect that stands out to me. \n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I believe these issues wouldn't have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. After all, even married men can become pedophiles. The problem stems from the individual, not their marital status.  Becoming a priest is a personal choice, and those who wish to marry while practicing their faith might consider other religious denominations that allow this.\n\nI also think pedophilia has a biological basis, related to genetics. It's not something people simply choose; they are born with these tendencies.  While upbringing might play a small role, I believe genetics are the primary factor.  Marriage wouldn't change this inherent predisposition.\n\nIf the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a separate matter and deeply troubling. However, I don't believe they were always aware or complicit in every instance.",
            "The initial concept of the Iraq War wasn't entirely disagreeable, but the events of September 11th cast a long shadow.  It seemed to me that the war was, in part, a reaction to those attacks, used as a justification to intervene.  The Bush administration strongly linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, assertions that have since been proven false. This discrepancy, this lack of honesty, deeply troubled me. It fueled a sense of outrage about the entire war.\n\nThe Bush administration, in my view, openly misled the American people and has yet to acknowledge this. Even Colin Powell,  after his prominent presentation at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this constitutes a serious abuse of power, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution, a pattern that began after September 11th.\n\nThere's a perception, stemming from the testimony of former officials, that the administration entered office with a pre-existing intention to engage in military action.  A former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently dismissed, alleged as much in his book.  It seems younger Bush harbored a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's administration's experiences.  Additionally, there's a suspicion that the administration sought to secure energy resources as a long-term objective, a rather underhanded approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe war has persisted for far too long. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further casualties, it's clear that the current situation is unsustainable. The international community, led by the UN, is exploring alternatives, such as a coalition of neighboring nations—Syria and Saudi Arabia, for instance—to restore order.  However, this approach also raises concerns, as it potentially compromises Iraq's sovereignty.  The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and there are serious divisions within the Iraqi Parliament.\n\nEven figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict, now hold significant political influence, with his party securing a considerable number of seats in the Parliament.  These internal struggles and the presence of radical factions threaten the fragile political process.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the initial impetus for intervention, I believe its continued presence has become more problematic than beneficial.  The lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about its legitimacy and raises concerns about the potential for a protracted conflict with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe stated goals of establishing democracy and securing access to oil appear to be at odds with the realities on the ground.  Imposing a foreign system of governance can be deeply disruptive and ultimately counterproductive, as it fails to address the underlying cultural and social dynamics within Iraqi society. Moreover, the prolonged presence of foreign troops has arguably exacerbated tensions and fueled resentment, contributing to instability and violence.\n\nThe human cost of this conflict is undeniable. Untold lives have been lost, families torn apart, and infrastructure decimated. It is essential to consider the impact on both Iraqi civilians and American service members, as well as the broader geopolitical implications of this prolonged involvement.\n\nUltimately, finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Iraq requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomacy, reconciliation, and respect for Iraqi sovereignty.",
            "The issue of legalizing  [specific action] is a complex one that raises fundamental questions about the role of government and religious freedom. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state provides a clear framework for understanding this issue.  \n\nThe document explicitly outlines this separation,  and attempting to legislate on matters of faith would be a direct violation of this established principle.  Furthermore, enacting a law prohibiting [specific action] would essentially endorse the beliefs of one religious group over others, creating a potentially divisive and unjust societal environment. \n\nThe United States has always prided itself on religious tolerance, and enshrining a law restricting religious practices would contradict this fundamental value.  \n\nI also believe that an amendment specifically targeting this issue would be unprecedented in its purpose. Most amendments are designed to limit government overreach, but this proposed amendment would, in fact, restrict the freedoms of individuals based on their religious beliefs. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe this matter should remain within the purview of religious institutions themselves.  The government should not intervene in matters of faith, and an amendment attempting to do so would be both inappropriate and detrimental to the fabric of our society.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue with many facets.  From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the conflict lacked transparency.  While the 9/11 attacks understandably fueled public outrage, the connection to Iraq felt tenuous at best.  The administration seemed to exploit this emotional vulnerability to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am a staunch opponent of war, particularly preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War: a costly endeavor with unpredictable consequences.  A significant number of American soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the situation has resulted in a power vacuum that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of their efforts in Vietnam.  However, such interventions often underestimate the complexities of nation-building.  \n\nThe challenges of establishing a functioning democracy in a country ravaged by conflict are immense. It requires time, patience, and a nuanced understanding of local cultures and politics.  The U.S. government's initial projections of a swift and decisive victory proved overly optimistic, leading to a protracted and increasingly costly conflict.\n\nMoreover, the war has raised ethical questions about the use of force and the role of the United States in global affairs.  If the stated goal is to promote democracy, why is Iraq singled out?  The potential for resource exploitation, particularly oil, cannot be disregarded.  Furthermore, the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while North Korea possesses them, raises concerns about the government's transparency and motives.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains fluid and fraught with uncertainty.  Finding a peaceful resolution is a daunting task, but it is essential to strive for an outcome that prioritizes the well-being of the Iraqi people and minimizes further loss of life.",
            "I strongly support the right to same-sex marriage. This stance has always been deeply held for me. I believe that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and, increasing scientific evidence suggests, has biological roots rather than solely sociological influences.  \n\nDenying individuals equal rights based on something beyond their control feels inherently unjust.  I've consistently advocated for marriage equality, as I see it as a matter of basic human dignity.\n\nIn my view, politics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage is a private matter, a matter of individual choice and commitment, best left to those involved and their immediate families.\n\nI live in a neighborhood where there are several openly gay couples who, despite not being legally married, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They raise dogs, walk the streets, and contribute to their community. Their lives exemplify the reality that love and commitment transcend legal definitions.\n\nI find attempts to define marriage narrowly and exclude same-sex couples deeply concerning. It feels like an overreach of authority, an attempt to impose a singular interpretation of a deeply personal concept.\n\nThere's a growing body of research indicating that sexual orientation has a biological basis. Studies suggest it's not simply a result of upbringing or environment but may be influenced by genetic and hormonal factors. This scientific understanding further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current legal landscape highlights the disparity. A heterosexual couple can easily marry without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to wed becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal affair, not subject to public scrutiny or government intervention. It should be a matter of individual choice, not a political debate.",
            "The nature of online platforms is inherently public. Once information is disseminated on the internet, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. This presents a significant challenge, particularly for individuals like myself who work in positions of responsibility, such as a resident advisor. I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. \n\nConsider the potential impact of sharing sensitive or controversial content.  Statements regarding violence or disruptive actions can be easily misinterpreted and cause alarm. Even seemingly innocuous remarks can be taken out of context and lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, for example, have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  If a concerning post is brought to their attention, they are obligated to investigate thoroughly. While it's important to respect individual privacy, the potential for harm outweighs these considerations in such situations.\n\nThis isn't to say that all online activity requires scrutiny. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine threats and harmless expressions. However, when there's a possibility of danger, schools must act responsibly.\n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when posting online.  While we may not be able to control how others perceive our words, we can choose our words carefully and understand the potential ramifications of our online presence.",
            "The ongoing conflict has stretched on for an extended period, and I believe the initial objectives have become obscured.  While the original intent may have been noble – to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system – I feel that we've strayed from that core purpose. \n\nThe conflict's duration raises concerns.  It's possible that motivations have shifted, perhaps influenced by past personal disputes between political figures. If the primary goal was indeed to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for intervention. However, if personal agendas played a role, it would cast a shadow on the conflict's legitimacy.\n\nIn the initial stages, the war served as a powerful statement, but its prolonged nature suggests a different intent.  It appears we're now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking to assert dominance rather than achieve a defined objective. This prolonged engagement is draining our resources, both financially and in terms of human life, while diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.\n\nWe should prioritize our own nation's needs, addressing challenges like poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and healthcare.  Billions of dollars spent on an unwinnable war could be better allocated to these crucial areas.  It's time to acknowledge that the conflict has lost its original purpose and bring it to a close.",
            "While I understand the concern about privacy, I believe that information shared online, particularly on platforms like Myspace, is generally accessible to a wider audience.  When you choose to display information on these sites, you essentially grant permission for others to view it.  \n\nThe concept of someone monitoring student profiles to prevent harm raises ethical concerns.  It seems impractical to assign such a task to a single individual, and it could potentially lead to discriminatory practices.  \n\nHowever, I agree that there are instances where online activity could signal potential danger.  It's a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring the safety of the community. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when sharing personal information online.\n\nMy own experience with social media platforms like Facebook has highlighted the potential risks.  It's unsettling to realize that strangers can access a considerable amount of information about us, even if we've taken steps to limit our exposure.  \n\nThe ability to connect with friends and family online is invaluable, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential downsides.  I strive to maintain a balance by being selective about my online connections and carefully considering what information I share.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed it from the outset, my perspective is more nuanced.  The widespread global disapproval of the war, reflected in polls conducted across the United States, Iraq, and internationally, is undeniable.  A significant majority of the population, including a large portion of U.S. troops stationed there, believe the conflict was ill-conceived and advocate for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been fraught with challenges from the beginning, and the prospect of a hasty exit also carries its own risks. The Middle East is a region marked by cultural and political complexities, and imposing Western democratic ideals onto a society with a distinct cultural framework has proven to be a difficult and often counterproductive endeavor.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against potential consequences.  It's clear that the war has had a devastating impact, both on Iraq and on American credibility on the world stage. \n\nAlthough I recognize the potential difficulties of a withdrawal, I believe that the Iraqi people's desire for our departure should be seriously considered.  A gradual and responsible exit strategy, perhaps extending over a year or more, could minimize the risks associated with a sudden departure. Ultimately, the long-term stability and well-being of the Iraqi people should be our paramount concern.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their field and societal expectations. \n\nWhile progress has been made towards gender equality, challenges persist.  Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, promotion opportunities may be limited due to historical biases. This can result in women being overlooked for leadership roles, even when they are equally or more qualified than their male counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, men can face discrimination in fields traditionally associated with women, such as caregiving or fashion. Societal norms often pressure men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to judgment or disapproval when they choose to stay at home or pursue non-traditional careers.\n\nFurthermore, individuals from diverse backgrounds may encounter discrimination based on their upbringing or communication style. This can create barriers to career advancement, regardless of their skills or qualifications.\n\nAddressing these complex issues requires a multifaceted approach that challenges societal norms and promotes inclusivity.  As we continue to evolve as a society, it is crucial to recognize and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender discrimination in all its forms.",

While decriminalization, which shifts the legal classification from a criminal offense to a minor infraction akin to a traffic ticket, has been implemented in some areas, its broader societal impacts remain a subject of debate.  \n\nOne argument in favor of decriminalization centers on the substantial financial burden associated with arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession. This cost extends to court proceedings, public defenders, and the judicial system itself.  \n\nProponents of decriminalization suggest that these resources could be more effectively allocated to essential public services, such as education, social welfare programs, and assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, opposition to decriminalization often stems from moral and social concerns. Some communities hold steadfast beliefs against marijuana use and resist any policy that might be perceived as condoning or normalizing it.\n\nThe impact of decriminalization on individual behavior and public perception also raises questions. While it aims to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, concerns remain about potential increases in accessibility and normalization, leading to issues like increased use among youth or potential impairment in public spaces. \n\nThe varying effects of marijuana on individuals, coupled with its continued legal gray areas, necessitate careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "My perspective on Catholicism is complex. While I admire its long-standing traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's stance on inclusivity.  While teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices, like the refusal to marry individuals from other faiths, seem contradictory. My parents' experience, with my father being Episcopalian and my mother Catholic, exemplifies this. Their union was not recognized within the Catholic Church solely because of my father's religion. This lack of tolerance, in my view, undermines the very message of love and acceptance that Catholicism espouses.\n\nFurthermore, there's a tension between doctrine and practice regarding social issues.  I believe allowing priests to marry could be a positive step, but the issue of child abuse within the clergy is a separate and deeply troubling concern. I don't believe marital status is a determining factor in such abhorrent behavior, as it stems from a fundamental moral failing.  Ultimately, addressing this issue requires comprehensive solutions that go beyond structural changes.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma, intertwining deeply with the fundamental principles of separation of church and state. Defining marriage, particularly in a manner that respects diverse viewpoints without causing offense, proves to be a significant challenge. \n\nPersonally, I believe the government should recognize civil unions as the appropriate framework for defining the legal rights and responsibilities associated with committed partnerships.  This approach avoids the entanglement of religious doctrines with legal definitions, mirroring how the government treats religious sacraments like baptism, which do not grant specific legal privileges.  \n\nIf two individuals enter into a civil union, their relationship should be recognized and protected by the government, regardless of the specific nature of their bond.  I feel that focusing on the fundamental aspect of two individuals uniting in a committed partnership, rather than the specific label of \"marriage,\"  is more inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the passionate arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach.  The Constitution is a foundational document that should be amended only for matters of paramount national importance. This particular issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic alteration to our fundamental law.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my views on homosexuality. While I value my many gay friends and believe in their right to live freely, I personally don't fully endorse their lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  I believe this is a matter best decided at the state level, allowing individual communities to determine what aligns with their values. \n\nDifferent states hold diverse political viewpoints, with some leaning Democratic and others Republican. It's natural that states with predominantly Democratic populations would be more likely to support gay marriage.  \n\nLiving in a state that legalizes same-sex marriage means accepting and respecting that decision, as it reflects the will of the people who reside there.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I support the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, but I feel that the decision should be made by individual states, not imposed nationally.  \n\nI disagree with the federal ban on gay marriage, as it disregards the autonomy of individual states.  \n\nThe President, while holding significant influence, should not dictate this highly personal and complex issue for the entire nation.  \n\nIt's a matter that should be left to the states to decide based on their unique circumstances and the will of their citizens. This allows for a more nuanced and democratic approach to this sensitive topic.",
            "The concept of privacy on platforms like Myspace is complex. While it's designed for public sharing, one must consider the potential consequences of what is posted.  School officials, while not explicitly authorized to monitor student activity on personal platforms, have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Accessing information, even if obtained indirectly, that could prevent harm or violence, might be justifiable in their pursuit of this duty.  \n\nHowever, the line blurs when it comes to proactive monitoring for minor infractions like underage drinking or smoking.  This raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse.  It's crucial to distinguish between preventing serious harm and policing everyday behaviors. \n\nThe permanence of online content is a significant factor.  Once something is posted, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove it completely. This underscores the importance of careful consideration before sharing anything online, especially when it comes to potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe goal should be to find a balance between protecting student privacy and ensuring a safe learning environment.  This requires open dialogue and clear guidelines regarding online behavior and expectations.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, the desire for retribution was strong. I believed military action was necessary to address the perceived threat and make those responsible accountable.  Looking back, I recognize that the emotional intensity surrounding the tragedy may have clouded our judgment. \n\nPerhaps we rushed into the conflict without a comprehensive strategy or a thorough understanding of the complexities of the situation. The lack of preparedness became evident as the conflict unfolded.  \n\nI've come to believe that external intervention alone cannot resolve the deeply rooted issues within the region. The ongoing internal struggles prevent a unified front against external threats. Our presence may inadvertently exacerbate these divisions and hinder progress towards lasting peace.\n\nThe nature of warfare differs significantly between cultures, and this disparity was a significant challenge.  The motivations and goals of the opposing forces were not always clear, making it difficult to achieve our objectives.\n\nWhile the initial impulse to respond to the attacks was understandable, I now question whether a more diplomatic approach might have been more effective in the long run.  We entered the conflict with a focus on retribution, which may have hindered our ability to build sustainable solutions.\n\nThe situation in the region remains complex and challenging.  It is essential to recognize the limitations of military intervention and explore alternative strategies that promote peace and stability. Ultimately, lasting solutions require a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and fosters cooperation among all parties involved."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe this can be partly attributed to its stance on certain social issues.  While the Church holds strong convictions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, these views are perceived by some as outdated.  \n\nA more contemporary approach to these matters might help the Church retain its following. I've heard that many individuals are distancing themselves from the Catholic Church due to disagreements with its positions on these issues.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a community that condemns it. Similarly, individuals who advocate for same-sex marriage might find the Church's stance on this issue incompatible with their beliefs. \n\nPersonally, I believe the Church should reconsider its strict regulations regarding female priests and married clergy.  \n\nWhile these changes may not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more inclusive and welcoming environment. After all, many other professions allow individuals to balance their personal lives with their work commitments.\n\nI think it's important for the Church to adapt to the evolving values of society.",
            "I personally don't have any objections to same-sex marriage.  I believe sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, not a choice.  Therefore, individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry, while allowing heterosexual couples to, seems discriminatory.  \n\nWhile I haven't extensively researched the topic, I strongly feel that it's unjust to limit marriage rights based on sexual orientation. People are born with different characteristics, including their sexual orientation, just as some are born left-handed and others right-handed.  It's not a decision anyone consciously makes.  \n\nI also believe that the federal government's role in this matter is limited. Marriage is a personal and societal institution, not a matter of national security or morality.  Government interference in such deeply personal choices feels inappropriate. It's important to respect individual autonomy and allow people to live their lives authentically without facing discrimination.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears. \n\nOne common concern is that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, the concept of \"family\" is diverse and evolving.  Just as heterosexual relationships vary widely, so do same-sex relationships.  The core elements of love, commitment, and shared responsibility transcend sexual orientation. \n\nLegal recognition of same-sex marriage is crucial for ensuring equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples.  This includes matters like property ownership, healthcare decisions, and inheritance. Denying these rights to same-sex couples creates a system of second-class citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that same-sex marriage violates religious beliefs is misplaced. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy.  While individuals are free to hold religious convictions, these beliefs should not dictate public policy that affects the rights of all citizens.\n\nOpponents often cite concerns about the impact of same-sex parenting on children.  However, extensive research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents.  The well-being of a child depends on the quality of the relationship they have with their parents, not their sexual orientation. \n\nUltimately, the fight for marriage equality is about basic human dignity and the right to live authentically.  It's about recognizing that love is love, regardless of who it is between.",
            "My summer job in a hospital pharmacy has given me a unique perspective on the complexities surrounding drug legality. While I understand the concerns about making certain substances readily available to the public, I believe a distinction should be made between recreational use and medicinal applications. \n\nThere are numerous drugs, even those classified as controlled substances, that are vital for therapeutic purposes within a medical setting.  Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples.  Denying access to potentially beneficial substances solely based on social stigma, as opposed to their inherent properties, seems illogical. \n\nThe debate surrounding marijuana is often clouded by misconceptions. While its potential for abuse exists, so does the potential for alcohol, which is legal.  A gradual approach to legalization, coupled with continued research and education, could help mitigate potential risks while allowing for responsible use and exploration of its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction.  Marijuana is not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine in terms of its potential for harm. By challenging the prevailing perception, we can create a more informed and nuanced conversation about its potential medical applications and responsible use.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to fit modern times. It's not as rigidly structured as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest: matching dresses, shoes, and purse. It was a part of my routine, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my classmates there on weekends. \n\nHowever, things have changed. The church now offers a mass specifically for teenagers, which is shorter and more casual.  People dress down more, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Families often arrive late, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. Even at the traditional morning masses, where I used to dress up, now people are more comfortable wearing jeans and khakis. \n\nThis shift towards casualness is the most noticeable change I've observed in the church. While I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this is the aspect that stands out to me. \n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I believe these issues wouldn't have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. After all, even married men can become pedophiles. The problem stems from the individual, not their marital status.  Becoming a priest is a personal choice, and those who wish to marry while practicing their faith might consider other religious denominations that allow this.\n\nI also think pedophilia has a biological basis, related to genetics. It's not something people simply choose; they are born with these tendencies.  While upbringing might play a small role, I believe genetics are the primary factor.  Marriage wouldn't change this inherent predisposition.\n\nIf the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a separate matter and deeply troubling. However, I don't believe they were always aware or complicit in every instance.",
            "The initial concept of the Iraq War wasn't entirely disagreeable, but the events of September 11th cast a long shadow.  It seemed to me that the war was, in part, a reaction to those attacks, used as a justification to intervene.  The Bush administration strongly linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, assertions that have since been proven false. This discrepancy, this lack of honesty, deeply troubled me. It fueled a sense of outrage about the entire war.\n\nThe Bush administration, in my view, openly misled the American people and has yet to acknowledge this. Even Colin Powell,  after his prominent presentation at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this constitutes a serious abuse of power, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution, a pattern that began after September 11th.\n\nThere's a perception, stemming from the testimony of former officials, that the administration entered office with a pre-existing intention to engage in military action.  A former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently dismissed, alleged as much in his book.  It seems younger Bush harbored a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's administration's experiences.  Additionally, there's a suspicion that the administration sought to secure energy resources as a long-term objective, a rather underhanded approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe war has persisted for far too long. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further casualties, it's clear that the current situation is unsustainable. The international community, led by the UN, is exploring alternatives, such as a coalition of neighboring nations—Syria and Saudi Arabia, for instance—to restore order.  However, this approach also raises concerns, as it potentially compromises Iraq's sovereignty.  The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and there are serious divisions within the Iraqi Parliament.\n\nEven figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict, now hold significant political influence, with his party securing a considerable number of seats in the Parliament.  These internal struggles and the presence of radical factions threaten the fragile political process.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the initial impetus for intervention, I believe its continued presence has become more problematic than beneficial.  The lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about its legitimacy and raises concerns about the potential for a protracted conflict with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe stated goals of establishing democracy and securing access to oil appear to be at odds with the realities on the ground.  Imposing a foreign system of governance can be deeply disruptive and ultimately counterproductive, as it fails to address the underlying cultural and social dynamics within Iraqi society. Moreover, the prolonged presence of foreign troops has arguably exacerbated tensions and fueled resentment, contributing to instability and violence.\n\nThe human cost of this conflict is undeniable. Untold lives have been lost, families torn apart, and infrastructure decimated. It is essential to consider the impact on both Iraqi civilians and American service members, as well as the broader geopolitical implications of this prolonged involvement.\n\nUltimately, finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Iraq requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomacy, reconciliation, and respect for Iraqi sovereignty.",
            "The issue of legalizing  [specific action] is a complex one that raises fundamental questions about the role of government and religious freedom. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state provides a clear framework for understanding this issue.  \n\nThe document explicitly outlines this separation,  and attempting to legislate on matters of faith would be a direct violation of this established principle.  Furthermore, enacting a law prohibiting [specific action] would essentially endorse the beliefs of one religious group over others, creating a potentially divisive and unjust societal environment. \n\nThe United States has always prided itself on religious tolerance, and enshrining a law restricting religious practices would contradict this fundamental value.  \n\nI also believe that an amendment specifically targeting this issue would be unprecedented in its purpose. Most amendments are designed to limit government overreach, but this proposed amendment would, in fact, restrict the freedoms of individuals based on their religious beliefs. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe this matter should remain within the purview of religious institutions themselves.  The government should not intervene in matters of faith, and an amendment attempting to do so would be both inappropriate and detrimental to the fabric of our society.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue with many facets.  From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the conflict lacked transparency.  While the 9/11 attacks understandably fueled public outrage, the connection to Iraq felt tenuous at best.  The administration seemed to exploit this emotional vulnerability to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am a staunch opponent of war, particularly preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War: a costly endeavor with unpredictable consequences.  A significant number of American soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the situation has resulted in a power vacuum that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of their efforts in Vietnam.  However, such interventions often underestimate the complexities of nation-building.  \n\nThe challenges of establishing a functioning democracy in a country ravaged by conflict are immense. It requires time, patience, and a nuanced understanding of local cultures and politics.  The U.S. government's initial projections of a swift and decisive victory proved overly optimistic, leading to a protracted and increasingly costly conflict.\n\nMoreover, the war has raised ethical questions about the use of force and the role of the United States in global affairs.  If the stated goal is to promote democracy, why is Iraq singled out?  The potential for resource exploitation, particularly oil, cannot be disregarded.  Furthermore, the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while North Korea possesses them, raises concerns about the government's transparency and motives.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains fluid and fraught with uncertainty.  Finding a peaceful resolution is a daunting task, but it is essential to strive for an outcome that prioritizes the well-being of the Iraqi people and minimizes further loss of life.",
            "I strongly support the right to same-sex marriage. This stance has always been deeply held for me. I believe that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and, increasing scientific evidence suggests, has biological roots rather than solely sociological influences.  \n\nDenying individuals equal rights based on something beyond their control feels inherently unjust.  I've consistently advocated for marriage equality, as I see it as a matter of basic human dignity.\n\nIn my view, politics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage is a private matter, a matter of individual choice and commitment, best left to those involved and their immediate families.\n\nI live in a neighborhood where there are several openly gay couples who, despite not being legally married, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They raise dogs, walk the streets, and contribute to their community. Their lives exemplify the reality that love and commitment transcend legal definitions.\n\nI find attempts to define marriage narrowly and exclude same-sex couples deeply concerning. It feels like an overreach of authority, an attempt to impose a singular interpretation of a deeply personal concept.\n\nThere's a growing body of research indicating that sexual orientation has a biological basis. Studies suggest it's not simply a result of upbringing or environment but may be influenced by genetic and hormonal factors. This scientific understanding further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current legal landscape highlights the disparity. A heterosexual couple can easily marry without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to wed becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal affair, not subject to public scrutiny or government intervention. It should be a matter of individual choice, not a political debate.",
            "The nature of online platforms is inherently public. Once information is disseminated on the internet, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. This presents a significant challenge, particularly for individuals like myself who work in positions of responsibility, such as a resident advisor. I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. \n\nConsider the potential impact of sharing sensitive or controversial content.  Statements regarding violence or disruptive actions can be easily misinterpreted and cause alarm. Even seemingly innocuous remarks can be taken out of context and lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, for example, have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  If a concerning post is brought to their attention, they are obligated to investigate thoroughly. While it's important to respect individual privacy, the potential for harm outweighs these considerations in such situations.\n\nThis isn't to say that all online activity requires scrutiny. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine threats and harmless expressions. However, when there's a possibility of danger, schools must act responsibly.\n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when posting online.  While we may not be able to control how others perceive our words, we can choose our words carefully and understand the potential ramifications of our online presence.",
            "The ongoing conflict has stretched on for an extended period, and I believe the initial objectives have become obscured.  While the original intent may have been noble – to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system – I feel that we've strayed from that core purpose. \n\nThe conflict's duration raises concerns.  It's possible that motivations have shifted, perhaps influenced by past personal disputes between political figures. If the primary goal was indeed to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for intervention. However, if personal agendas played a role, it would cast a shadow on the conflict's legitimacy.\n\nIn the initial stages, the war served as a powerful statement, but its prolonged nature suggests a different intent.  It appears we're now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking to assert dominance rather than achieve a defined objective. This prolonged engagement is draining our resources, both financially and in terms of human life, while diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.\n\nWe should prioritize our own nation's needs, addressing challenges like poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and healthcare.  Billions of dollars spent on an unwinnable war could be better allocated to these crucial areas.  It's time to acknowledge that the conflict has lost its original purpose and bring it to a close.",
            "While I understand the concern about privacy, I believe that information shared online, particularly on platforms like Myspace, is generally accessible to a wider audience.  When you choose to display information on these sites, you essentially grant permission for others to view it.  \n\nThe concept of someone monitoring student profiles to prevent harm raises ethical concerns.  It seems impractical to assign such a task to a single individual, and it could potentially lead to discriminatory practices.  \n\nHowever, I agree that there are instances where online activity could signal potential danger.  It's a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring the safety of the community. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when sharing personal information online.\n\nMy own experience with social media platforms like Facebook has highlighted the potential risks.  It's unsettling to realize that strangers can access a considerable amount of information about us, even if we've taken steps to limit our exposure.  \n\nThe ability to connect with friends and family online is invaluable, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential downsides.  I strive to maintain a balance by being selective about my online connections and carefully considering what information I share.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed it from the outset, my perspective is more nuanced.  The widespread global disapproval of the war, reflected in polls conducted across the United States, Iraq, and internationally, is undeniable.  A significant majority of the population, including a large portion of U.S. troops stationed there, believe the conflict was ill-conceived and advocate for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been fraught with challenges from the beginning, and the prospect of a hasty exit also carries its own risks. The Middle East is a region marked by cultural and political complexities, and imposing Western democratic ideals onto a society with a distinct cultural framework has proven to be a difficult and often counterproductive endeavor.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against potential consequences.  It's clear that the war has had a devastating impact, both on Iraq and on American credibility on the world stage. \n\nAlthough I recognize the potential difficulties of a withdrawal, I believe that the Iraqi people's desire for our departure should be seriously considered.  A gradual and responsible exit strategy, perhaps extending over a year or more, could minimize the risks associated with a sudden departure. Ultimately, the long-term stability and well-being of the Iraqi people should be our paramount concern.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their field and societal expectations. \n\nWhile progress has been made towards gender equality, challenges persist.  Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, promotion opportunities may be limited due to historical biases. This can result in women being overlooked for leadership roles, even when they are equally or more qualified than their male counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, men can face discrimination in fields traditionally associated with women, such as caregiving or fashion. Societal norms often pressure men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to judgment or disapproval when they choose to stay at home or pursue non-traditional careers.\n\nFurthermore, individuals from diverse backgrounds may encounter discrimination based on their upbringing or communication style. This can create barriers to career advancement, regardless of their skills or qualifications.\n\nAddressing these complex issues requires a multifaceted approach that challenges societal norms and promotes inclusivity.  As we continue to evolve as a society, it is crucial to recognize and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender discrimination in all its forms.",

While decriminalization, which shifts the legal classification from a criminal offense to a minor infraction akin to a traffic ticket, has been implemented in some areas, its broader societal impacts remain a subject of debate.  \n\nOne argument in favor of decriminalization centers on the substantial financial burden associated with arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession. This cost extends to court proceedings, public defenders, and the judicial system itself.  \n\nProponents of decriminalization suggest that these resources could be more effectively allocated to essential public services, such as education, social welfare programs, and assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, opposition to decriminalization often stems from moral and social concerns. Some communities hold steadfast beliefs against marijuana use and resist any policy that might be perceived as condoning or normalizing it.\n\nThe impact of decriminalization on individual behavior and public perception also raises questions. While it aims to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, concerns remain about potential increases in accessibility and normalization, leading to issues like increased use among youth or potential impairment in public spaces. \n\nThe varying effects of marijuana on individuals, coupled with its continued legal gray areas, necessitate careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "My perspective on Catholicism is complex. While I admire its long-standing traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's stance on inclusivity.  While teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices, like the refusal to marry individuals from other faiths, seem contradictory. My parents' experience, with my father being Episcopalian and my mother Catholic, exemplifies this. Their union was not recognized within the Catholic Church solely because of my father's religion. This lack of tolerance, in my view, undermines the very message of love and acceptance that Catholicism espouses.\n\nFurthermore, there's a tension between doctrine and practice regarding social issues.  I believe allowing priests to marry could be a positive step, but the issue of child abuse within the clergy is a separate and deeply troubling concern. I don't believe marital status is a determining factor in such abhorrent behavior, as it stems from a fundamental moral failing.  Ultimately, addressing this issue requires comprehensive solutions that go beyond structural changes.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma, intertwining deeply with the fundamental principles of separation of church and state. Defining marriage, particularly in a manner that respects diverse viewpoints without causing offense, proves to be a significant challenge. \n\nPersonally, I believe the government should recognize civil unions as the appropriate framework for defining the legal rights and responsibilities associated with committed partnerships.  This approach avoids the entanglement of religious doctrines with legal definitions, mirroring how the government treats religious sacraments like baptism, which do not grant specific legal privileges.  \n\nIf two individuals enter into a civil union, their relationship should be recognized and protected by the government, regardless of the specific nature of their bond.  I feel that focusing on the fundamental aspect of two individuals uniting in a committed partnership, rather than the specific label of \"marriage,\"  is more inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the passionate arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach.  The Constitution is a foundational document that should be amended only for matters of paramount national importance. This particular issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic alteration to our fundamental law.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my views on homosexuality. While I value my many gay friends and believe in their right to live freely, I personally don't fully endorse their lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  I believe this is a matter best decided at the state level, allowing individual communities to determine what aligns with their values. \n\nDifferent states hold diverse political viewpoints, with some leaning Democratic and others Republican. It's natural that states with predominantly Democratic populations would be more likely to support gay marriage.  \n\nLiving in a state that legalizes same-sex marriage means accepting and respecting that decision, as it reflects the will of the people who reside there.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I support the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, but I feel that the decision should be made by individual states, not imposed nationally.  \n\nI disagree with the federal ban on gay marriage, as it disregards the autonomy of individual states.  \n\nThe President, while holding significant influence, should not dictate this highly personal and complex issue for the entire nation.  \n\nIt's a matter that should be left to the states to decide based on their unique circumstances and the will of their citizens. This allows for a more nuanced and democratic approach to this sensitive topic.",
            "The concept of privacy on platforms like Myspace is complex. While it's designed for public sharing, one must consider the potential consequences of what is posted.  School officials, while not explicitly authorized to monitor student activity on personal platforms, have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Accessing information, even if obtained indirectly, that could prevent harm or violence, might be justifiable in their pursuit of this duty.  \n\nHowever, the line blurs when it comes to proactive monitoring for minor infractions like underage drinking or smoking.  This raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse.  It's crucial to distinguish between preventing serious harm and policing everyday behaviors. \n\nThe permanence of online content is a significant factor.  Once something is posted, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove it completely. This underscores the importance of careful consideration before sharing anything online, especially when it comes to potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe goal should be to find a balance between protecting student privacy and ensuring a safe learning environment.  This requires open dialogue and clear guidelines regarding online behavior and expectations.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, the desire for retribution was strong. I believed military action was necessary to address the perceived threat and make those responsible accountable.  Looking back, I recognize that the emotional intensity surrounding the tragedy may have clouded our judgment. \n\nPerhaps we rushed into the conflict without a comprehensive strategy or a thorough understanding of the complexities of the situation. The lack of preparedness became evident as the conflict unfolded.  \n\nI've come to believe that external intervention alone cannot resolve the deeply rooted issues within the region. The ongoing internal struggles prevent a unified front against external threats. Our presence may inadvertently exacerbate these divisions and hinder progress towards lasting peace.\n\nThe nature of warfare differs significantly between cultures, and this disparity was a significant challenge.  The motivations and goals of the opposing forces were not always clear, making it difficult to achieve our objectives.\n\nWhile the initial impulse to respond to the attacks was understandable, I now question whether a more diplomatic approach might have been more effective in the long run.  We entered the conflict with a focus on retribution, which may have hindered our ability to build sustainable solutions.\n\nThe situation in the region remains complex and challenging.  It is essential to recognize the limitations of military intervention and explore alternative strategies that promote peace and stability. Ultimately, lasting solutions require a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and fosters cooperation among all parties involved."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its membership, and I believe this can be partly attributed to its stance on certain social issues.  While the Church holds strong convictions on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control, these views are perceived by some as outdated.  \n\nA more contemporary approach to these matters might help the Church retain its following. I've heard that many individuals are distancing themselves from the Catholic Church due to disagreements with its positions on these issues.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a community that condemns it. Similarly, individuals who advocate for same-sex marriage might find the Church's stance on this issue incompatible with their beliefs. \n\nPersonally, I believe the Church should reconsider its strict regulations regarding female priests and married clergy.  \n\nWhile these changes may not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more inclusive and welcoming environment. After all, many other professions allow individuals to balance their personal lives with their work commitments.\n\nI think it's important for the Church to adapt to the evolving values of society.",
            "I personally don't have any objections to same-sex marriage.  I believe sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity, not a choice.  Therefore, individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry, while allowing heterosexual couples to, seems discriminatory.  \n\nWhile I haven't extensively researched the topic, I strongly feel that it's unjust to limit marriage rights based on sexual orientation. People are born with different characteristics, including their sexual orientation, just as some are born left-handed and others right-handed.  It's not a decision anyone consciously makes.  \n\nI also believe that the federal government's role in this matter is limited. Marriage is a personal and societal institution, not a matter of national security or morality.  Government interference in such deeply personal choices feels inappropriate. It's important to respect individual autonomy and allow people to live their lives authentically without facing discrimination.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears. \n\nOne common concern is that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, the concept of \"family\" is diverse and evolving.  Just as heterosexual relationships vary widely, so do same-sex relationships.  The core elements of love, commitment, and shared responsibility transcend sexual orientation. \n\nLegal recognition of same-sex marriage is crucial for ensuring equal access to rights and benefits enjoyed by heterosexual couples.  This includes matters like property ownership, healthcare decisions, and inheritance. Denying these rights to same-sex couples creates a system of second-class citizenship.\n\nFurthermore, the argument that same-sex marriage violates religious beliefs is misplaced. The separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy.  While individuals are free to hold religious convictions, these beliefs should not dictate public policy that affects the rights of all citizens.\n\nOpponents often cite concerns about the impact of same-sex parenting on children.  However, extensive research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents thrive just as well as children raised by heterosexual parents.  The well-being of a child depends on the quality of the relationship they have with their parents, not their sexual orientation. \n\nUltimately, the fight for marriage equality is about basic human dignity and the right to live authentically.  It's about recognizing that love is love, regardless of who it is between.",
            "My summer job in a hospital pharmacy has given me a unique perspective on the complexities surrounding drug legality. While I understand the concerns about making certain substances readily available to the public, I believe a distinction should be made between recreational use and medicinal applications. \n\nThere are numerous drugs, even those classified as controlled substances, that are vital for therapeutic purposes within a medical setting.  Oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples.  Denying access to potentially beneficial substances solely based on social stigma, as opposed to their inherent properties, seems illogical. \n\nThe debate surrounding marijuana is often clouded by misconceptions. While its potential for abuse exists, so does the potential for alcohol, which is legal.  A gradual approach to legalization, coupled with continued research and education, could help mitigate potential risks while allowing for responsible use and exploration of its therapeutic benefits.  \n\nThe negative image associated with marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However, it's crucial to separate fact from fiction.  Marijuana is not comparable to substances like heroin or cocaine in terms of its potential for harm. By challenging the prevailing perception, we can create a more informed and nuanced conversation about its potential medical applications and responsible use.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to fit modern times. It's not as rigidly structured as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest: matching dresses, shoes, and purse. It was a part of my routine, especially since I went to a private school and saw many of my classmates there on weekends. \n\nHowever, things have changed. The church now offers a mass specifically for teenagers, which is shorter and more casual.  People dress down more, especially in the summer, sometimes even coming straight from the beach. Families often arrive late, creating a more relaxed atmosphere. Even at the traditional morning masses, where I used to dress up, now people are more comfortable wearing jeans and khakis. \n\nThis shift towards casualness is the most noticeable change I've observed in the church. While I'm not deeply involved in the church's internal politics, this is the aspect that stands out to me. \n\nRegarding the accusations against some Catholic priests, I believe these issues wouldn't have been prevented by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. After all, even married men can become pedophiles. The problem stems from the individual, not their marital status.  Becoming a priest is a personal choice, and those who wish to marry while practicing their faith might consider other religious denominations that allow this.\n\nI also think pedophilia has a biological basis, related to genetics. It's not something people simply choose; they are born with these tendencies.  While upbringing might play a small role, I believe genetics are the primary factor.  Marriage wouldn't change this inherent predisposition.\n\nIf the church was aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a separate matter and deeply troubling. However, I don't believe they were always aware or complicit in every instance.",
            "The initial concept of the Iraq War wasn't entirely disagreeable, but the events of September 11th cast a long shadow.  It seemed to me that the war was, in part, a reaction to those attacks, used as a justification to intervene.  The Bush administration strongly linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, assertions that have since been proven false. This discrepancy, this lack of honesty, deeply troubled me. It fueled a sense of outrage about the entire war.\n\nThe Bush administration, in my view, openly misled the American people and has yet to acknowledge this. Even Colin Powell,  after his prominent presentation at the UN, has admitted he wasn't convinced by the evidence at the time. To me, this constitutes a serious abuse of power, an impeachable offense. I believe the Bush administration's actions demonstrate a blatant disregard for the Constitution, a pattern that began after September 11th.\n\nThere's a perception, stemming from the testimony of former officials, that the administration entered office with a pre-existing intention to engage in military action.  A former Secretary of the Treasury, who was subsequently dismissed, alleged as much in his book.  It seems younger Bush harbored a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's administration's experiences.  Additionally, there's a suspicion that the administration sought to secure energy resources as a long-term objective, a rather underhanded approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe war has persisted for far too long. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further casualties, it's clear that the current situation is unsustainable. The international community, led by the UN, is exploring alternatives, such as a coalition of neighboring nations—Syria and Saudi Arabia, for instance—to restore order.  However, this approach also raises concerns, as it potentially compromises Iraq's sovereignty.  The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and there are serious divisions within the Iraqi Parliament.\n\nEven figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we recently engaged in conflict, now hold significant political influence, with his party securing a considerable number of seats in the Parliament.  These internal struggles and the presence of radical factions threaten the fragile political process.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the initial impetus for intervention, I believe its continued presence has become more problematic than beneficial.  The lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about its legitimacy and raises concerns about the potential for a protracted conflict with unforeseen consequences.\n\nThe stated goals of establishing democracy and securing access to oil appear to be at odds with the realities on the ground.  Imposing a foreign system of governance can be deeply disruptive and ultimately counterproductive, as it fails to address the underlying cultural and social dynamics within Iraqi society. Moreover, the prolonged presence of foreign troops has arguably exacerbated tensions and fueled resentment, contributing to instability and violence.\n\nThe human cost of this conflict is undeniable. Untold lives have been lost, families torn apart, and infrastructure decimated. It is essential to consider the impact on both Iraqi civilians and American service members, as well as the broader geopolitical implications of this prolonged involvement.\n\nUltimately, finding a lasting solution to the conflict in Iraq requires a nuanced and multifaceted approach that prioritizes diplomacy, reconciliation, and respect for Iraqi sovereignty.",
            "The issue of legalizing  [specific action] is a complex one that raises fundamental questions about the role of government and religious freedom. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state provides a clear framework for understanding this issue.  \n\nThe document explicitly outlines this separation,  and attempting to legislate on matters of faith would be a direct violation of this established principle.  Furthermore, enacting a law prohibiting [specific action] would essentially endorse the beliefs of one religious group over others, creating a potentially divisive and unjust societal environment. \n\nThe United States has always prided itself on religious tolerance, and enshrining a law restricting religious practices would contradict this fundamental value.  \n\nI also believe that an amendment specifically targeting this issue would be unprecedented in its purpose. Most amendments are designed to limit government overreach, but this proposed amendment would, in fact, restrict the freedoms of individuals based on their religious beliefs. \n\nTherefore, I firmly believe this matter should remain within the purview of religious institutions themselves.  The government should not intervene in matters of faith, and an amendment attempting to do so would be both inappropriate and detrimental to the fabric of our society.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex issue with many facets.  From the outset, I believe the government's justifications for the conflict lacked transparency.  While the 9/11 attacks understandably fueled public outrage, the connection to Iraq felt tenuous at best.  The administration seemed to exploit this emotional vulnerability to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003.\n\nPersonally, I am a staunch opponent of war, particularly preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War: a costly endeavor with unpredictable consequences.  A significant number of American soldiers have sacrificed their lives, and the situation has resulted in a power vacuum that has destabilized the region.\n\nThe U.S. government attempted to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of their efforts in Vietnam.  However, such interventions often underestimate the complexities of nation-building.  \n\nThe challenges of establishing a functioning democracy in a country ravaged by conflict are immense. It requires time, patience, and a nuanced understanding of local cultures and politics.  The U.S. government's initial projections of a swift and decisive victory proved overly optimistic, leading to a protracted and increasingly costly conflict.\n\nMoreover, the war has raised ethical questions about the use of force and the role of the United States in global affairs.  If the stated goal is to promote democracy, why is Iraq singled out?  The potential for resource exploitation, particularly oil, cannot be disregarded.  Furthermore, the lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while North Korea possesses them, raises concerns about the government's transparency and motives.\n\nThe situation in Iraq remains fluid and fraught with uncertainty.  Finding a peaceful resolution is a daunting task, but it is essential to strive for an outcome that prioritizes the well-being of the Iraqi people and minimizes further loss of life.",
            "I strongly support the right to same-sex marriage. This stance has always been deeply held for me. I believe that sexual orientation is a fundamental aspect of a person's identity and, increasing scientific evidence suggests, has biological roots rather than solely sociological influences.  \n\nDenying individuals equal rights based on something beyond their control feels inherently unjust.  I've consistently advocated for marriage equality, as I see it as a matter of basic human dignity.\n\nIn my view, politics and government shouldn't dictate personal relationships. Marriage is a private matter, a matter of individual choice and commitment, best left to those involved and their immediate families.\n\nI live in a neighborhood where there are several openly gay couples who, despite not being legally married, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They raise dogs, walk the streets, and contribute to their community. Their lives exemplify the reality that love and commitment transcend legal definitions.\n\nI find attempts to define marriage narrowly and exclude same-sex couples deeply concerning. It feels like an overreach of authority, an attempt to impose a singular interpretation of a deeply personal concept.\n\nThere's a growing body of research indicating that sexual orientation has a biological basis. Studies suggest it's not simply a result of upbringing or environment but may be influenced by genetic and hormonal factors. This scientific understanding further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current legal landscape highlights the disparity. A heterosexual couple can easily marry without fanfare, but a same-sex couple's decision to wed becomes a public spectacle.  Marriage should be a private, personal affair, not subject to public scrutiny or government intervention. It should be a matter of individual choice, not a political debate.",
            "The nature of online platforms is inherently public. Once information is disseminated on the internet, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. This presents a significant challenge, particularly for individuals like myself who work in positions of responsibility, such as a resident advisor. I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online posts. \n\nConsider the potential impact of sharing sensitive or controversial content.  Statements regarding violence or disruptive actions can be easily misinterpreted and cause alarm. Even seemingly innocuous remarks can be taken out of context and lead to unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, for example, have a duty to ensure the safety and well-being of their students.  If a concerning post is brought to their attention, they are obligated to investigate thoroughly. While it's important to respect individual privacy, the potential for harm outweighs these considerations in such situations.\n\nThis isn't to say that all online activity requires scrutiny. It's crucial to distinguish between genuine threats and harmless expressions. However, when there's a possibility of danger, schools must act responsibly.\n\nThe responsibility ultimately lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when posting online.  While we may not be able to control how others perceive our words, we can choose our words carefully and understand the potential ramifications of our online presence.",
            "The ongoing conflict has stretched on for an extended period, and I believe the initial objectives have become obscured.  While the original intent may have been noble – to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system – I feel that we've strayed from that core purpose. \n\nThe conflict's duration raises concerns.  It's possible that motivations have shifted, perhaps influenced by past personal disputes between political figures. If the primary goal was indeed to promote democracy, that would be a justifiable reason for intervention. However, if personal agendas played a role, it would cast a shadow on the conflict's legitimacy.\n\nIn the initial stages, the war served as a powerful statement, but its prolonged nature suggests a different intent.  It appears we're now fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking to assert dominance rather than achieve a defined objective. This prolonged engagement is draining our resources, both financially and in terms of human life, while diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.\n\nWe should prioritize our own nation's needs, addressing challenges like poverty, inadequate infrastructure, and healthcare.  Billions of dollars spent on an unwinnable war could be better allocated to these crucial areas.  It's time to acknowledge that the conflict has lost its original purpose and bring it to a close.",
            "While I understand the concern about privacy, I believe that information shared online, particularly on platforms like Myspace, is generally accessible to a wider audience.  When you choose to display information on these sites, you essentially grant permission for others to view it.  \n\nThe concept of someone monitoring student profiles to prevent harm raises ethical concerns.  It seems impractical to assign such a task to a single individual, and it could potentially lead to discriminatory practices.  \n\nHowever, I agree that there are instances where online activity could signal potential danger.  It's a delicate balance between protecting individual privacy and ensuring the safety of the community. Ultimately, the responsibility lies with individuals to exercise caution and discretion when sharing personal information online.\n\nMy own experience with social media platforms like Facebook has highlighted the potential risks.  It's unsettling to realize that strangers can access a considerable amount of information about us, even if we've taken steps to limit our exposure.  \n\nThe ability to connect with friends and family online is invaluable, but it's crucial to be aware of the potential downsides.  I strive to maintain a balance by being selective about my online connections and carefully considering what information I share.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed it from the outset, my perspective is more nuanced.  The widespread global disapproval of the war, reflected in polls conducted across the United States, Iraq, and internationally, is undeniable.  A significant majority of the population, including a large portion of U.S. troops stationed there, believe the conflict was ill-conceived and advocate for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been fraught with challenges from the beginning, and the prospect of a hasty exit also carries its own risks. The Middle East is a region marked by cultural and political complexities, and imposing Western democratic ideals onto a society with a distinct cultural framework has proven to be a difficult and often counterproductive endeavor.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against potential consequences.  It's clear that the war has had a devastating impact, both on Iraq and on American credibility on the world stage. \n\nAlthough I recognize the potential difficulties of a withdrawal, I believe that the Iraqi people's desire for our departure should be seriously considered.  A gradual and responsible exit strategy, perhaps extending over a year or more, could minimize the risks associated with a sudden departure. Ultimately, the long-term stability and well-being of the Iraqi people should be our paramount concern.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, affecting not only women but also men depending on their field and societal expectations. \n\nWhile progress has been made towards gender equality, challenges persist.  Women often face a \"glass ceiling,\" where despite qualifications, promotion opportunities may be limited due to historical biases. This can result in women being overlooked for leadership roles, even when they are equally or more qualified than their male counterparts.\n\nSimilarly, men can face discrimination in fields traditionally associated with women, such as caregiving or fashion. Societal norms often pressure men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to judgment or disapproval when they choose to stay at home or pursue non-traditional careers.\n\nFurthermore, individuals from diverse backgrounds may encounter discrimination based on their upbringing or communication style. This can create barriers to career advancement, regardless of their skills or qualifications.\n\nAddressing these complex issues requires a multifaceted approach that challenges societal norms and promotes inclusivity.  As we continue to evolve as a society, it is crucial to recognize and dismantle the systemic barriers that perpetuate gender discrimination in all its forms.",

While decriminalization, which shifts the legal classification from a criminal offense to a minor infraction akin to a traffic ticket, has been implemented in some areas, its broader societal impacts remain a subject of debate.  \n\nOne argument in favor of decriminalization centers on the substantial financial burden associated with arresting, processing, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession. This cost extends to court proceedings, public defenders, and the judicial system itself.  \n\nProponents of decriminalization suggest that these resources could be more effectively allocated to essential public services, such as education, social welfare programs, and assistance for the homeless.\n\nHowever, opposition to decriminalization often stems from moral and social concerns. Some communities hold steadfast beliefs against marijuana use and resist any policy that might be perceived as condoning or normalizing it.\n\nThe impact of decriminalization on individual behavior and public perception also raises questions. While it aims to reduce the stigma associated with marijuana use, concerns remain about potential increases in accessibility and normalization, leading to issues like increased use among youth or potential impairment in public spaces. \n\nThe varying effects of marijuana on individuals, coupled with its continued legal gray areas, necessitate careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "My perspective on Catholicism is complex. While I admire its long-standing traditions and the sense of stability they provide, I also believe in the importance of adaptability and progress. \n\nOne area where I see a disconnect is in the Church's stance on inclusivity.  While teachings emphasize love and acceptance, certain practices, like the refusal to marry individuals from other faiths, seem contradictory. My parents' experience, with my father being Episcopalian and my mother Catholic, exemplifies this. Their union was not recognized within the Catholic Church solely because of my father's religion. This lack of tolerance, in my view, undermines the very message of love and acceptance that Catholicism espouses.\n\nFurthermore, there's a tension between doctrine and practice regarding social issues.  I believe allowing priests to marry could be a positive step, but the issue of child abuse within the clergy is a separate and deeply troubling concern. I don't believe marital status is a determining factor in such abhorrent behavior, as it stems from a fundamental moral failing.  Ultimately, addressing this issue requires comprehensive solutions that go beyond structural changes.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma, intertwining deeply with the fundamental principles of separation of church and state. Defining marriage, particularly in a manner that respects diverse viewpoints without causing offense, proves to be a significant challenge. \n\nPersonally, I believe the government should recognize civil unions as the appropriate framework for defining the legal rights and responsibilities associated with committed partnerships.  This approach avoids the entanglement of religious doctrines with legal definitions, mirroring how the government treats religious sacraments like baptism, which do not grant specific legal privileges.  \n\nIf two individuals enter into a civil union, their relationship should be recognized and protected by the government, regardless of the specific nature of their bond.  I feel that focusing on the fundamental aspect of two individuals uniting in a committed partnership, rather than the specific label of \"marriage,\"  is more inclusive and respectful of diverse beliefs.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the passionate arguments on both sides of this debate, I believe a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach.  The Constitution is a foundational document that should be amended only for matters of paramount national importance. This particular issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic alteration to our fundamental law.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my views on homosexuality. While I value my many gay friends and believe in their right to live freely, I personally don't fully endorse their lifestyle.  \n\nHowever, I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage.  I believe this is a matter best decided at the state level, allowing individual communities to determine what aligns with their values. \n\nDifferent states hold diverse political viewpoints, with some leaning Democratic and others Republican. It's natural that states with predominantly Democratic populations would be more likely to support gay marriage.  \n\nLiving in a state that legalizes same-sex marriage means accepting and respecting that decision, as it reflects the will of the people who reside there.  \n\nUltimately, I believe in equality for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.  I support the legal recognition of same-sex relationships, but I feel that the decision should be made by individual states, not imposed nationally.  \n\nI disagree with the federal ban on gay marriage, as it disregards the autonomy of individual states.  \n\nThe President, while holding significant influence, should not dictate this highly personal and complex issue for the entire nation.  \n\nIt's a matter that should be left to the states to decide based on their unique circumstances and the will of their citizens. This allows for a more nuanced and democratic approach to this sensitive topic.",
            "The concept of privacy on platforms like Myspace is complex. While it's designed for public sharing, one must consider the potential consequences of what is posted.  School officials, while not explicitly authorized to monitor student activity on personal platforms, have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their students. Accessing information, even if obtained indirectly, that could prevent harm or violence, might be justifiable in their pursuit of this duty.  \n\nHowever, the line blurs when it comes to proactive monitoring for minor infractions like underage drinking or smoking.  This raises serious concerns about privacy and the potential for misuse.  It's crucial to distinguish between preventing serious harm and policing everyday behaviors. \n\nThe permanence of online content is a significant factor.  Once something is posted, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to remove it completely. This underscores the importance of careful consideration before sharing anything online, especially when it comes to potentially sensitive information.\n\nThe goal should be to find a balance between protecting student privacy and ensuring a safe learning environment.  This requires open dialogue and clear guidelines regarding online behavior and expectations.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, the desire for retribution was strong. I believed military action was necessary to address the perceived threat and make those responsible accountable.  Looking back, I recognize that the emotional intensity surrounding the tragedy may have clouded our judgment. \n\nPerhaps we rushed into the conflict without a comprehensive strategy or a thorough understanding of the complexities of the situation. The lack of preparedness became evident as the conflict unfolded.  \n\nI've come to believe that external intervention alone cannot resolve the deeply rooted issues within the region. The ongoing internal struggles prevent a unified front against external threats. Our presence may inadvertently exacerbate these divisions and hinder progress towards lasting peace.\n\nThe nature of warfare differs significantly between cultures, and this disparity was a significant challenge.  The motivations and goals of the opposing forces were not always clear, making it difficult to achieve our objectives.\n\nWhile the initial impulse to respond to the attacks was understandable, I now question whether a more diplomatic approach might have been more effective in the long run.  We entered the conflict with a focus on retribution, which may have hindered our ability to build sustainable solutions.\n\nThe situation in the region remains complex and challenging.  It is essential to recognize the limitations of military intervention and explore alternative strategies that promote peace and stability. Ultimately, lasting solutions require a multifaceted approach that addresses the underlying issues and fosters cooperation among all parties involved."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a challenge in retaining its members. I believe this decline is partly due to its stance on certain contemporary issues.  \n\nWhile the Church holds strong, traditional views on topics like marriage equality, abortion, and contraception, these positions may not resonate with a modern audience.  \n\nMany individuals find the Church's perspective on these matters outdated and, consequently, feel alienated.  They seek a faith community that aligns with their own beliefs and values.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a church that vehemently opposes it. Similarly, someone who advocates for same-sex marriage might not find a welcoming environment in a Church that does not. \n\nPerhaps the Church could benefit from a more inclusive and adaptable approach to these complex issues. Embracing a wider range of perspectives might help bridge the gap and attract new generations of believers.  \n\nThe Church's assertion that priests are \"married to God\" and devote their lives solely to their ministry doesn't seem to adequately account for the human experience of wanting both a spiritual calling and a personal life.  Allowing priests to marry could potentially address this perceived disconnect and offer a more relatable model for aspiring clergy.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a conscious decision, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people responsible for something they are born with. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that a man and a woman's union is inherently different or superior.\n\nWhile I haven't extensively studied the legal and societal implications of same-sex marriage, I strongly feel that it's a matter of personal liberty and should be respected.  \n\nPerhaps the government's role shouldn't extend to regulating personal relationships, especially those that don't infringe upon the rights or well-being of others.  It seems to me that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and given the same opportunities for happiness and commitment as heterosexual couples.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness. Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions about same-sex relationships.  It's crucial to recognize that the dynamics within a committed partnership, regardless of sexual orientation, share many commonalities. \n\nOpponents sometimes cite concerns about societal impacts, particularly regarding children raised by same-sex couples. However, extensive research indicates that children thrive in loving and supportive environments, and the parenting styles of same-sex couples are demonstrably comparable to those of heterosexual couples.  \n\nThe issue of marriage equality transcends religious beliefs and delves into the realm of civil rights. Access to legal recognition and the benefits associated with marriage, such as healthcare and property rights, should be extended equally to all committed couples. \n\nAdvocating for a government-sanctioned distinction between different types of relationships is akin to segregation, perpetuating inequality under the guise of differing moral viewpoints.\n\nWhile personal beliefs are important, imposing them on an entire nation through legal means is both unethical and inconsistent with the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. The government should uphold the rights of all its citizens, ensuring that legal frameworks reflect the values of equality and justice.",
            "The experience I gained working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer truly shaped my perspective on drug legality. While I understand the concerns surrounding the illicit status of certain substances, I believe the classification of a drug as illegal shouldn't automatically preclude its potential medicinal benefits. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, that are legally prescribed and utilized in pharmacies for their therapeutic value.  Denying the potential benefits of marijuana simply because of societal stigma seems illogical to me.  We should prioritize exploring its medicinal applications rather than dismissing them outright.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol presents a complex dilemma. Both substances can be misused, leading to negative consequences. However, I believe a measured approach is necessary.  Gradually integrating marijuana into legal frameworks, rather than a sudden legalization, might mitigate potential abuse while allowing for responsible use.  \n\nThe negative public perception surrounding marijuana stems largely from its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that marijuana's potential for harm pales in comparison to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By challenging the misconception of marijuana as inherently dangerous, we can create an environment where its responsible use, particularly for medical purposes, is more readily accepted.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to suit the modern world. It's not as rigid as it once was. Looking back, when I was younger, every Sunday was a big event. I'd put on my best attire – a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse to complete the look. That was the norm for me, especially since I attended a private school where I saw my friends every weekend. We'd all gather at church.\n\nNow, things have changed.  They've introduced a special mass for teenagers, keeping it concise at thirty minutes.  People dress much more casually, especially during summer. It's common to see people in beach attire, straight from the shore. You'll even find families rushing in late.  \n\nEven at the traditional morning masses, where I used to be meticulous about my appearance, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. While khakis are perfectly acceptable, the overall trend leans towards casual wear. \n\nPersonally, this shift in attire is the most noticeable change I've observed. As for other aspects of the church, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. I'm not deeply involved in the church's politics, but these changes are evident in my experience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests, I believe these issues are complex and deeply rooted.  \n\nI don't think simply allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have prevented these occurrences.  After all, pedophilia can affect anyone, regardless of marital status. It's a deeply personal struggle, and I believe it stems from individual factors rather than religious rules.  \n\nIt's important to remember that becoming a priest is a personal choice. Other religions allow for married clergy, such as the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both a religious calling and marriage, they might consider exploring those options.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War held some appeal, but the aftermath of September 11th cast a long shadow over the decision-making process. It appears that the Bush administration utilized  the attacks as a pretext to justify military action, linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This disconnect between stated justifications and reality deeply troubles me. The administration's actions seem to demonstrate a blatant disregard for truthfulness and transparency with the American people.\n\nColin Powell's subsequent admission that he harbored doubts about the evidence presented at the UN further reinforces this concern.  To mislead the nation on such a momentous occasion is, in my view, a grave offense, bordering on impeachable.  \n\nThere's a pervasive feeling that the Bush administration's approach towards the Constitution has been one of erosion since September 11th.  It's been suggested, albeit by those outside the administration, that their ambition from the outset included military intervention.  \n\nThe motivations behind the war remain complex and multifaceted.  One theory posits a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from the previous administration's dealings with Iraq.  Another proposes an underlying desire to secure American energy interests in the region, a strategy I find deeply problematic. \n\nThe duration of the conflict has undeniably caused immense suffering, and a hasty withdrawal could exacerbate the situation by triggering civil strife and further bloodshed.  The current plan, involving a coalition of neighboring nations, presents its own set of challenges.  It raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and the potential for long-term instability. \n\nThe interim government's fragility is evident, with the Parliament seemingly ineffective and the Prime Minister lacking substantial control. The presence of powerful factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party further complicates the political landscape, creating a volatile environment rife with internal conflict.",
            "The ongoing conflict in Iraq presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivation for intervention, I believe the current situation lacks a clear purpose. The absence of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about the legitimacy of our involvement. \n\nThe stated goals of fostering democracy and securing energy resources seem at odds with the reality on the ground.  Attempts to impose our political system on a culture vastly different from our own risk exacerbating tensions and fostering resentment.  The potential for long-term instability and the erosion of our national image as a result of continued involvement are significant concerns. \n\nFurthermore, the human cost of this protracted conflict is undeniable. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are at stake. It's essential to consider the well-being of all parties involved and explore alternative paths to a peaceful resolution.",
            "The issue of legalization presents a complex dilemma, especially considering the foundational principles of the United States. I firmly believe that the Constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state should serve as a guiding principle in this matter. The document explicitly outlines this separation, and any attempt to legislate on this issue would, in my view, constitute a direct challenge to this established tenet. \n\nFurthermore, imposing legal restrictions on a practice that is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs raises serious concerns about the government's overreach.  Different religious communities hold diverse perspectives on this matter, and attempting to codify one specific belief system into law would inevitably disadvantage others. \n\nThe Constitution has long been lauded for promoting religious tolerance, and enacting an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very foundation.  It's crucial to remember that the Constitution's purpose is primarily to safeguard individual liberties and limit government power.  An amendment aimed at restricting individual choices rather than government actions would be a significant departure from this principle.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the government should abstain from interfering in this domain.  It is not the role of the state to dictate the internal practices of religious institutions.  Ultimately, the decision should rest with individual religious communities, guided by their own doctrines and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  While the initial justification for the invasion centered around concerns about weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism, many believe the true motives were more multifaceted.  \n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that the government's portrayal of the conflict to the American public was not entirely transparent.  The emotional fallout from the September 11th attacks was undoubtedly exploited to garner public support for the war, potentially overshadowing a more nuanced understanding of the situation. \n\nPersonally, I hold reservations about preemptive military action in general.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the historical mistakes made during the Vietnam War, highlighting the dangers of underestimating the complexities of foreign intervention.  \n\nThe high number of American casualties is a tragic consequence of the conflict, and the long-term ramifications of the removal of the Iraqi government have proven to be far-reaching and difficult to predict.\n\nThe United States' attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a challenging endeavor, mirroring the difficulties encountered during the Vietnam War.  The complexities of nation-building and the inherent resistance to foreign influence often lead to protracted and costly conflicts.\n\nThe war has raised important ethical questions about the role of the United States in global affairs.  The decision to intervene militarily should not be taken lightly, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences, both short-term and long-term, is essential.\n\nI believe that a more thorough and transparent approach to foreign policy is crucial, one that prioritizes diplomacy and international cooperation whenever possible.  The Iraq War serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for careful consideration before resorting to military force.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage is clear: I wholeheartedly support it.  This belief stems from a fundamental understanding that personal preferences, particularly regarding relationships, should be respected and protected.  \n\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests a biological basis for sexual orientation, further emphasizing the argument against restricting rights based on something beyond an individual's control. Denying individuals equal rights due to their inherent nature is, in my view, deeply inhumane.  I've always been a vocal advocate for marriage equality.\n\nPolitics and government should not dictate personal choices like marriage. It's a matter of individual and familial autonomy, not a public issue.  Even in my own neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who, despite not being legally recognized, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They contribute to their community, raise children, and deserve the same legal recognition and protections.  \n\nWhen public figures attempt to impose their own interpretations of marriage, it feels intrusive and dismissive of the lived experiences of countless individuals.  \n\nResearch increasingly points to a biological predisposition for sexual orientation. It's not a choice, and it's not a result of sociological factors. This biological basis further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nMarriage, at its core, is a personal commitment. While heterosexual couples can easily choose to marry discreetly, the same isn't true for same-sex couples.  Their decisions are often subject to public scrutiny and debate, highlighting the need for greater acceptance and legal equality.  Marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle subject to political and social agendas.",
            "The digital landscape presents unique challenges regarding privacy and responsibility.  Once information is shared online, it enters the public sphere and can significantly influence how others perceive an individual. This raises important questions about the consequences of our digital footprints. \n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts, even those intended as jokes, have been misinterpreted and raised concerns.  The internet's wide reach means that information can quickly spread beyond the intended audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, in particular, face the difficult task of balancing the need to protect students with the right to free expression.  While it's crucial to prevent potential harm, it's equally important to respect students' privacy.  \n\nA delicate line exists between monitoring for safety concerns and overstepping boundaries.  While schools may be obligated to investigate credible threats, it's essential to avoid intrusive surveillance practices.  Open communication and trust between students and school officials are vital in navigating these complex issues.  \n\nUltimately, individuals bear responsibility for the content they share online.  Before posting, it's important to consider the potential impact on oneself and others.  The internet offers a powerful platform for connection and expression, but it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial intention, to establish democracy in a nation lacking democratic principles, seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. \n\nIt feels as though the conflict has evolved into a demonstration of power, rather than a genuine effort to promote democracy. Concerns exist regarding the motivations behind the war's initiation, particularly potential connections to past disputes between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the primary objective was indeed to bring democracy to a country lacking political fairness, that would be a justifiable reason. However, any personal agendas involved would undoubtedly undermine the ethical foundation of the war.\n\nDespite the initial impact and statement made in the early months, the prolonged nature of the conflict—spanning several years—is deeply troubling. It appears that the war has become self-perpetuating, with the focus shifting from achieving a clear objective to simply continuing the fight, seeking a decisive victory.\n\nThe war's extended duration has become detrimental.  The country's government and its people must eventually be responsible for their own governance. We've reached a point where our continued involvement is draining our own economy, diverting resources from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Billions are being spent on a conflict that no longer serves its original purpose. \n\nIt's crucial to prioritize domestic needs and allocate resources effectively. The ongoing war diverts essential funds from vital areas that require immediate attention.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one.  While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, there are still ethical considerations.  For instance, while users choose to share information, it's unsettling to think that someone could misuse that information, especially to harm others.  \n\nThere's a fine line between responsible monitoring and unwarranted intrusion.  It's difficult to imagine a school system effectively monitoring student activity on social media without crossing that line.  Such a system could easily lead to unfair targeting and discrimination.  \n\nHowever, the potential for harm is real.  I've personally experienced the unsettling feeling of strangers contacting me on platforms like Facebook, knowing personal details about me that I hadn't publicly shared. It highlights the vulnerability of online information and the need for caution.\n\nThe issue of schools banning social media use by students raises questions about freedom of expression and the role of technology in education.  While I understand the potential dangers, I believe outright bans might not be the most effective solution.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach, focusing on digital literacy and responsible online behavior, would be more beneficial.",
            "The Iraq War has been a deeply complex issue, and my perspective on it has evolved over time. While I understand the initial justifications for the intervention, the ongoing situation has raised serious concerns.  \n\nPublic opinion, both domestically and internationally, has consistently indicated widespread disapproval of the war's conduct and its lasting consequences. Polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and individuals globally believe the war was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, advocating for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe war's impact has been undeniably devastating, exacerbating existing tensions and instability in the region.  The cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East make it challenging to impose solutions from the outside. Attempts to establish democracy in a region with deeply entrenched traditions and power structures have proven to be deeply problematic.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been based on a thorough assessment of the potential ramifications. The consequences, both immediate and long-term, have been far-reaching and have created a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe possibility of a complete withdrawal from Iraq remains a contentious topic. While I recognize the complexities involved, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the voices of the Iraqi people. Their desire for self-determination and their calls for our departure should be seriously considered.  \n\nA gradual withdrawal, conducted responsibly and in consultation with Iraqi leaders, might be a more palatable option. However, the urgency for a definitive exit strategy is undeniable.  The consequences of prolonged military involvement continue to weigh heavily on both Iraq and the United States.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it often manifests differently depending on the field and societal expectations. While progress has been made towards gender equality, certain industries and roles continue to exhibit biases.\n\n For example, women frequently encounter a \"glass ceiling\" where, despite qualifications, they may face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to historical gender roles and societal perceptions. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children often encounter prejudice and societal pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms.\n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where male designers may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable simply because they do not adhere to stereotypically masculine aesthetics. These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of gender discrimination, demonstrating how societal expectations and ingrained biases can impact individuals regardless of their gender.\n\nWhile change is gradual, the increasing representation of women in leadership roles and the growing acceptance of diverse family structures suggest that societal attitudes are evolving.  It is crucial to continue challenging these biases and promote inclusion in all aspects of society.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex, encompassing both legal and social implications.  \n\nDecriminalization, as opposed to full legalization, shifts the focus from criminal offenses to civil infractions. This means individuals caught with marijuana might face citations similar to traffic violations, rather than arrest and prosecution.  While this diminishes the immediate legal consequences, long-term ramifications like employment hurdles remain a concern.\n\nHowever, decriminalization presents financial benefits for municipalities. The costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration can be substantial. By diverting resources from marijuana enforcement, communities could potentially allocate funds towards essential services such as education, social programs, and homelessness support.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization gains traction in areas with more progressive social values, where financial considerations and a desire for social reform are prioritized. Denver, for example, has embraced decriminalization, potentially freeing up resources for community betterment.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential for increased marijuana use if legalized, mirroring the accessibility of cigarettes.  \n\nThe societal stigma surrounding marijuana use also persists, and widespread availability could lead to discomfort and awkwardness in certain contexts. \n\nUltimately, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, and its impact on individual lifestyles and decision-making is multifaceted.  A nuanced approach is essential when considering the legalization debate, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "While I respect the enduring traditions of the Catholic Church, I believe that maintaining relevance in a changing world requires adaptability. There are certain aspects of Catholicism, such as the emphasis on weekly church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine, that can feel exclusionary.  \n\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith marriage faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This experience highlighted a perceived contradiction between the Church's teachings of love and acceptance and its reluctance to embrace individuals from diverse religious backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, some Catholic practices seem outdated, particularly regarding the celibacy requirement for priests. While I support the idea of allowing priests to marry, I recognize that such a change might not necessarily address issues of misconduct. \n\nUltimately, I believe that the root causes of such problems lie beyond marital status and require multifaceted solutions. It's important to remember that individuals who engage in harmful acts, such as child abuse, often do so regardless of their personal circumstances.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage is undeniably complex, residing at the intersection of deeply held religious beliefs and the fundamental principles of individual liberty and equality. \n\nDetermining the appropriate legal framework for marriage presents a significant challenge. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, suggesting that the government should not dictate religious practices or doctrines. On the other hand, marriage has historically been recognized as a societal institution with legal and social implications, leading to questions about the role of government in defining and regulating it.\n\nSome argue that marriage should be solely a religious sacrament, while others believe it should be a civil contract governed by the state.  The potential for legal recognition of same-sex marriages raises concerns about the impact on religious freedom and traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIt's important to consider the diverse perspectives on this issue and engage in respectful dialogue to find a solution that balances the rights of all individuals.  While I believe that civil unions offer a viable alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, I acknowledge the strong emotional and personal significance that marriage holds for many. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage should be decided through a thoughtful and inclusive process that respects both individual liberties and the principles of equality.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my perspective on homosexuality. It's a complex issue for me, as I value my friendships with individuals who identify as gay. While I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle, I believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to determine its own laws regarding marriage. The United States is a diverse nation with varying political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states, for instance, are more likely to support same-sex marriage, reflecting the values of their constituents.  \n\nIndividuals choosing to reside in a particular state should respect the legal framework and social norms established by that state.  Conversely, I believe a national mandate on such a sensitive topic would be inappropriate, as it would disregard the diverse viewpoints and cultural contexts across the country.\n\nI firmly believe in equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Therefore, I support a state-by-state approach to legalization, allowing each community to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and accommodating society while respecting individual autonomy and local control.  \n\nThe current federal ban on gay marriage, in my opinion, oversteps the bounds of federal authority. It's a matter best left to the individual states to decide.  Furthermore, the political landscape is constantly evolving. A future administration with different priorities could potentially overturn this ban, leading to a back-and-forth situation.  \n\nA state-by-state approach allows for a more nuanced and enduring solution, empowering communities to shape their own destinies and create a more harmonious and just society.",
            "The concept of privacy in the digital age is complex. While MySpace, for instance, presents itself as a public platform, the expectation of complete visibility can be misleading. Individuals might not always anticipate the potential consequences of their online actions, especially when it comes to sensitive information.\n\nHowever, when considering the safety and security of students, the boundaries of privacy can become blurred. School officials, entrusted with the well-being of their students, have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent potential harm.\n\nIf accessing social media platforms like MySpace serves as a tool to identify and address threats, it could be argued that the potential benefit outweighs the infringement on privacy.  The idea of schools monitoring student activity online is controversial, but the goal of creating a safe learning environment for all is paramount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact. Once information is shared online, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to fully remove it. This permanence necessitates careful consideration of the content we post and the potential consequences it could have on our future.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between individual privacy and collective safety is a delicate and ongoing challenge in our increasingly interconnected world.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I felt a surge of anger and a strong desire for retribution. I believed that military action against those responsible was necessary and justified. However, with time, I've come to question the wisdom of our involvement. \n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding 9/11 may have overshadowed a careful consideration of the long-term consequences. It seems we entered the conflict hastily, lacking a comprehensive plan and unprepared for the complexities of the situation. \n\nLooking back, I believe the intervention has ultimately been counterproductive. The ongoing conflict has fueled instability and division within the region, hindering any possibility of lasting peace. It's become increasingly clear that external intervention is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted issues at play. \n\nThe culture of war in that part of the world is vastly different from our own. Their methods are often brutal and their motivations complex, making it difficult to achieve our objectives through traditional means.  \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now believe that a more diplomatic approach would have been more effective. We should focus on fostering understanding and cooperation rather than resorting to military force.  \n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and divisive affair. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider a more sustainable path towards peace. We need to prioritize diplomacy and work towards building bridges rather than walls."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a challenge in retaining its members. I believe this decline is partly due to its stance on certain contemporary issues.  \n\nWhile the Church holds strong, traditional views on topics like marriage equality, abortion, and contraception, these positions may not resonate with a modern audience.  \n\nMany individuals find the Church's perspective on these matters outdated and, consequently, feel alienated.  They seek a faith community that aligns with their own beliefs and values.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a church that vehemently opposes it. Similarly, someone who advocates for same-sex marriage might not find a welcoming environment in a Church that does not. \n\nPerhaps the Church could benefit from a more inclusive and adaptable approach to these complex issues. Embracing a wider range of perspectives might help bridge the gap and attract new generations of believers.  \n\nThe Church's assertion that priests are \"married to God\" and devote their lives solely to their ministry doesn't seem to adequately account for the human experience of wanting both a spiritual calling and a personal life.  Allowing priests to marry could potentially address this perceived disconnect and offer a more relatable model for aspiring clergy.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a conscious decision, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people responsible for something they are born with. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that a man and a woman's union is inherently different or superior.\n\nWhile I haven't extensively studied the legal and societal implications of same-sex marriage, I strongly feel that it's a matter of personal liberty and should be respected.  \n\nPerhaps the government's role shouldn't extend to regulating personal relationships, especially those that don't infringe upon the rights or well-being of others.  It seems to me that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and given the same opportunities for happiness and commitment as heterosexual couples.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness. Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions about same-sex relationships.  It's crucial to recognize that the dynamics within a committed partnership, regardless of sexual orientation, share many commonalities. \n\nOpponents sometimes cite concerns about societal impacts, particularly regarding children raised by same-sex couples. However, extensive research indicates that children thrive in loving and supportive environments, and the parenting styles of same-sex couples are demonstrably comparable to those of heterosexual couples.  \n\nThe issue of marriage equality transcends religious beliefs and delves into the realm of civil rights. Access to legal recognition and the benefits associated with marriage, such as healthcare and property rights, should be extended equally to all committed couples. \n\nAdvocating for a government-sanctioned distinction between different types of relationships is akin to segregation, perpetuating inequality under the guise of differing moral viewpoints.\n\nWhile personal beliefs are important, imposing them on an entire nation through legal means is both unethical and inconsistent with the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. The government should uphold the rights of all its citizens, ensuring that legal frameworks reflect the values of equality and justice.",
            "The experience I gained working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer truly shaped my perspective on drug legality. While I understand the concerns surrounding the illicit status of certain substances, I believe the classification of a drug as illegal shouldn't automatically preclude its potential medicinal benefits. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, that are legally prescribed and utilized in pharmacies for their therapeutic value.  Denying the potential benefits of marijuana simply because of societal stigma seems illogical to me.  We should prioritize exploring its medicinal applications rather than dismissing them outright.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol presents a complex dilemma. Both substances can be misused, leading to negative consequences. However, I believe a measured approach is necessary.  Gradually integrating marijuana into legal frameworks, rather than a sudden legalization, might mitigate potential abuse while allowing for responsible use.  \n\nThe negative public perception surrounding marijuana stems largely from its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that marijuana's potential for harm pales in comparison to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By challenging the misconception of marijuana as inherently dangerous, we can create an environment where its responsible use, particularly for medical purposes, is more readily accepted.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to suit the modern world. It's not as rigid as it once was. Looking back, when I was younger, every Sunday was a big event. I'd put on my best attire – a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse to complete the look. That was the norm for me, especially since I attended a private school where I saw my friends every weekend. We'd all gather at church.\n\nNow, things have changed.  They've introduced a special mass for teenagers, keeping it concise at thirty minutes.  People dress much more casually, especially during summer. It's common to see people in beach attire, straight from the shore. You'll even find families rushing in late.  \n\nEven at the traditional morning masses, where I used to be meticulous about my appearance, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. While khakis are perfectly acceptable, the overall trend leans towards casual wear. \n\nPersonally, this shift in attire is the most noticeable change I've observed. As for other aspects of the church, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. I'm not deeply involved in the church's politics, but these changes are evident in my experience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests, I believe these issues are complex and deeply rooted.  \n\nI don't think simply allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have prevented these occurrences.  After all, pedophilia can affect anyone, regardless of marital status. It's a deeply personal struggle, and I believe it stems from individual factors rather than religious rules.  \n\nIt's important to remember that becoming a priest is a personal choice. Other religions allow for married clergy, such as the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both a religious calling and marriage, they might consider exploring those options.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War held some appeal, but the aftermath of September 11th cast a long shadow over the decision-making process. It appears that the Bush administration utilized  the attacks as a pretext to justify military action, linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This disconnect between stated justifications and reality deeply troubles me. The administration's actions seem to demonstrate a blatant disregard for truthfulness and transparency with the American people.\n\nColin Powell's subsequent admission that he harbored doubts about the evidence presented at the UN further reinforces this concern.  To mislead the nation on such a momentous occasion is, in my view, a grave offense, bordering on impeachable.  \n\nThere's a pervasive feeling that the Bush administration's approach towards the Constitution has been one of erosion since September 11th.  It's been suggested, albeit by those outside the administration, that their ambition from the outset included military intervention.  \n\nThe motivations behind the war remain complex and multifaceted.  One theory posits a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from the previous administration's dealings with Iraq.  Another proposes an underlying desire to secure American energy interests in the region, a strategy I find deeply problematic. \n\nThe duration of the conflict has undeniably caused immense suffering, and a hasty withdrawal could exacerbate the situation by triggering civil strife and further bloodshed.  The current plan, involving a coalition of neighboring nations, presents its own set of challenges.  It raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and the potential for long-term instability. \n\nThe interim government's fragility is evident, with the Parliament seemingly ineffective and the Prime Minister lacking substantial control. The presence of powerful factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party further complicates the political landscape, creating a volatile environment rife with internal conflict.",
            "The ongoing conflict in Iraq presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivation for intervention, I believe the current situation lacks a clear purpose. The absence of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about the legitimacy of our involvement. \n\nThe stated goals of fostering democracy and securing energy resources seem at odds with the reality on the ground.  Attempts to impose our political system on a culture vastly different from our own risk exacerbating tensions and fostering resentment.  The potential for long-term instability and the erosion of our national image as a result of continued involvement are significant concerns. \n\nFurthermore, the human cost of this protracted conflict is undeniable. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are at stake. It's essential to consider the well-being of all parties involved and explore alternative paths to a peaceful resolution.",
            "The issue of legalization presents a complex dilemma, especially considering the foundational principles of the United States. I firmly believe that the Constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state should serve as a guiding principle in this matter. The document explicitly outlines this separation, and any attempt to legislate on this issue would, in my view, constitute a direct challenge to this established tenet. \n\nFurthermore, imposing legal restrictions on a practice that is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs raises serious concerns about the government's overreach.  Different religious communities hold diverse perspectives on this matter, and attempting to codify one specific belief system into law would inevitably disadvantage others. \n\nThe Constitution has long been lauded for promoting religious tolerance, and enacting an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very foundation.  It's crucial to remember that the Constitution's purpose is primarily to safeguard individual liberties and limit government power.  An amendment aimed at restricting individual choices rather than government actions would be a significant departure from this principle.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the government should abstain from interfering in this domain.  It is not the role of the state to dictate the internal practices of religious institutions.  Ultimately, the decision should rest with individual religious communities, guided by their own doctrines and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  While the initial justification for the invasion centered around concerns about weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism, many believe the true motives were more multifaceted.  \n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that the government's portrayal of the conflict to the American public was not entirely transparent.  The emotional fallout from the September 11th attacks was undoubtedly exploited to garner public support for the war, potentially overshadowing a more nuanced understanding of the situation. \n\nPersonally, I hold reservations about preemptive military action in general.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the historical mistakes made during the Vietnam War, highlighting the dangers of underestimating the complexities of foreign intervention.  \n\nThe high number of American casualties is a tragic consequence of the conflict, and the long-term ramifications of the removal of the Iraqi government have proven to be far-reaching and difficult to predict.\n\nThe United States' attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a challenging endeavor, mirroring the difficulties encountered during the Vietnam War.  The complexities of nation-building and the inherent resistance to foreign influence often lead to protracted and costly conflicts.\n\nThe war has raised important ethical questions about the role of the United States in global affairs.  The decision to intervene militarily should not be taken lightly, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences, both short-term and long-term, is essential.\n\nI believe that a more thorough and transparent approach to foreign policy is crucial, one that prioritizes diplomacy and international cooperation whenever possible.  The Iraq War serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for careful consideration before resorting to military force.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage is clear: I wholeheartedly support it.  This belief stems from a fundamental understanding that personal preferences, particularly regarding relationships, should be respected and protected.  \n\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests a biological basis for sexual orientation, further emphasizing the argument against restricting rights based on something beyond an individual's control. Denying individuals equal rights due to their inherent nature is, in my view, deeply inhumane.  I've always been a vocal advocate for marriage equality.\n\nPolitics and government should not dictate personal choices like marriage. It's a matter of individual and familial autonomy, not a public issue.  Even in my own neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who, despite not being legally recognized, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They contribute to their community, raise children, and deserve the same legal recognition and protections.  \n\nWhen public figures attempt to impose their own interpretations of marriage, it feels intrusive and dismissive of the lived experiences of countless individuals.  \n\nResearch increasingly points to a biological predisposition for sexual orientation. It's not a choice, and it's not a result of sociological factors. This biological basis further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nMarriage, at its core, is a personal commitment. While heterosexual couples can easily choose to marry discreetly, the same isn't true for same-sex couples.  Their decisions are often subject to public scrutiny and debate, highlighting the need for greater acceptance and legal equality.  Marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle subject to political and social agendas.",
            "The digital landscape presents unique challenges regarding privacy and responsibility.  Once information is shared online, it enters the public sphere and can significantly influence how others perceive an individual. This raises important questions about the consequences of our digital footprints. \n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts, even those intended as jokes, have been misinterpreted and raised concerns.  The internet's wide reach means that information can quickly spread beyond the intended audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, in particular, face the difficult task of balancing the need to protect students with the right to free expression.  While it's crucial to prevent potential harm, it's equally important to respect students' privacy.  \n\nA delicate line exists between monitoring for safety concerns and overstepping boundaries.  While schools may be obligated to investigate credible threats, it's essential to avoid intrusive surveillance practices.  Open communication and trust between students and school officials are vital in navigating these complex issues.  \n\nUltimately, individuals bear responsibility for the content they share online.  Before posting, it's important to consider the potential impact on oneself and others.  The internet offers a powerful platform for connection and expression, but it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial intention, to establish democracy in a nation lacking democratic principles, seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. \n\nIt feels as though the conflict has evolved into a demonstration of power, rather than a genuine effort to promote democracy. Concerns exist regarding the motivations behind the war's initiation, particularly potential connections to past disputes between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the primary objective was indeed to bring democracy to a country lacking political fairness, that would be a justifiable reason. However, any personal agendas involved would undoubtedly undermine the ethical foundation of the war.\n\nDespite the initial impact and statement made in the early months, the prolonged nature of the conflict—spanning several years—is deeply troubling. It appears that the war has become self-perpetuating, with the focus shifting from achieving a clear objective to simply continuing the fight, seeking a decisive victory.\n\nThe war's extended duration has become detrimental.  The country's government and its people must eventually be responsible for their own governance. We've reached a point where our continued involvement is draining our own economy, diverting resources from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Billions are being spent on a conflict that no longer serves its original purpose. \n\nIt's crucial to prioritize domestic needs and allocate resources effectively. The ongoing war diverts essential funds from vital areas that require immediate attention.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one.  While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, there are still ethical considerations.  For instance, while users choose to share information, it's unsettling to think that someone could misuse that information, especially to harm others.  \n\nThere's a fine line between responsible monitoring and unwarranted intrusion.  It's difficult to imagine a school system effectively monitoring student activity on social media without crossing that line.  Such a system could easily lead to unfair targeting and discrimination.  \n\nHowever, the potential for harm is real.  I've personally experienced the unsettling feeling of strangers contacting me on platforms like Facebook, knowing personal details about me that I hadn't publicly shared. It highlights the vulnerability of online information and the need for caution.\n\nThe issue of schools banning social media use by students raises questions about freedom of expression and the role of technology in education.  While I understand the potential dangers, I believe outright bans might not be the most effective solution.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach, focusing on digital literacy and responsible online behavior, would be more beneficial.",
            "The Iraq War has been a deeply complex issue, and my perspective on it has evolved over time. While I understand the initial justifications for the intervention, the ongoing situation has raised serious concerns.  \n\nPublic opinion, both domestically and internationally, has consistently indicated widespread disapproval of the war's conduct and its lasting consequences. Polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and individuals globally believe the war was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, advocating for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe war's impact has been undeniably devastating, exacerbating existing tensions and instability in the region.  The cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East make it challenging to impose solutions from the outside. Attempts to establish democracy in a region with deeply entrenched traditions and power structures have proven to be deeply problematic.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been based on a thorough assessment of the potential ramifications. The consequences, both immediate and long-term, have been far-reaching and have created a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe possibility of a complete withdrawal from Iraq remains a contentious topic. While I recognize the complexities involved, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the voices of the Iraqi people. Their desire for self-determination and their calls for our departure should be seriously considered.  \n\nA gradual withdrawal, conducted responsibly and in consultation with Iraqi leaders, might be a more palatable option. However, the urgency for a definitive exit strategy is undeniable.  The consequences of prolonged military involvement continue to weigh heavily on both Iraq and the United States.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it often manifests differently depending on the field and societal expectations. While progress has been made towards gender equality, certain industries and roles continue to exhibit biases.\n\n For example, women frequently encounter a \"glass ceiling\" where, despite qualifications, they may face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to historical gender roles and societal perceptions. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children often encounter prejudice and societal pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms.\n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where male designers may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable simply because they do not adhere to stereotypically masculine aesthetics. These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of gender discrimination, demonstrating how societal expectations and ingrained biases can impact individuals regardless of their gender.\n\nWhile change is gradual, the increasing representation of women in leadership roles and the growing acceptance of diverse family structures suggest that societal attitudes are evolving.  It is crucial to continue challenging these biases and promote inclusion in all aspects of society.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex, encompassing both legal and social implications.  \n\nDecriminalization, as opposed to full legalization, shifts the focus from criminal offenses to civil infractions. This means individuals caught with marijuana might face citations similar to traffic violations, rather than arrest and prosecution.  While this diminishes the immediate legal consequences, long-term ramifications like employment hurdles remain a concern.\n\nHowever, decriminalization presents financial benefits for municipalities. The costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration can be substantial. By diverting resources from marijuana enforcement, communities could potentially allocate funds towards essential services such as education, social programs, and homelessness support.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization gains traction in areas with more progressive social values, where financial considerations and a desire for social reform are prioritized. Denver, for example, has embraced decriminalization, potentially freeing up resources for community betterment.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential for increased marijuana use if legalized, mirroring the accessibility of cigarettes.  \n\nThe societal stigma surrounding marijuana use also persists, and widespread availability could lead to discomfort and awkwardness in certain contexts. \n\nUltimately, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, and its impact on individual lifestyles and decision-making is multifaceted.  A nuanced approach is essential when considering the legalization debate, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "While I respect the enduring traditions of the Catholic Church, I believe that maintaining relevance in a changing world requires adaptability. There are certain aspects of Catholicism, such as the emphasis on weekly church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine, that can feel exclusionary.  \n\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith marriage faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This experience highlighted a perceived contradiction between the Church's teachings of love and acceptance and its reluctance to embrace individuals from diverse religious backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, some Catholic practices seem outdated, particularly regarding the celibacy requirement for priests. While I support the idea of allowing priests to marry, I recognize that such a change might not necessarily address issues of misconduct. \n\nUltimately, I believe that the root causes of such problems lie beyond marital status and require multifaceted solutions. It's important to remember that individuals who engage in harmful acts, such as child abuse, often do so regardless of their personal circumstances.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage is undeniably complex, residing at the intersection of deeply held religious beliefs and the fundamental principles of individual liberty and equality. \n\nDetermining the appropriate legal framework for marriage presents a significant challenge. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, suggesting that the government should not dictate religious practices or doctrines. On the other hand, marriage has historically been recognized as a societal institution with legal and social implications, leading to questions about the role of government in defining and regulating it.\n\nSome argue that marriage should be solely a religious sacrament, while others believe it should be a civil contract governed by the state.  The potential for legal recognition of same-sex marriages raises concerns about the impact on religious freedom and traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIt's important to consider the diverse perspectives on this issue and engage in respectful dialogue to find a solution that balances the rights of all individuals.  While I believe that civil unions offer a viable alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, I acknowledge the strong emotional and personal significance that marriage holds for many. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage should be decided through a thoughtful and inclusive process that respects both individual liberties and the principles of equality.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my perspective on homosexuality. It's a complex issue for me, as I value my friendships with individuals who identify as gay. While I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle, I believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to determine its own laws regarding marriage. The United States is a diverse nation with varying political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states, for instance, are more likely to support same-sex marriage, reflecting the values of their constituents.  \n\nIndividuals choosing to reside in a particular state should respect the legal framework and social norms established by that state.  Conversely, I believe a national mandate on such a sensitive topic would be inappropriate, as it would disregard the diverse viewpoints and cultural contexts across the country.\n\nI firmly believe in equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Therefore, I support a state-by-state approach to legalization, allowing each community to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and accommodating society while respecting individual autonomy and local control.  \n\nThe current federal ban on gay marriage, in my opinion, oversteps the bounds of federal authority. It's a matter best left to the individual states to decide.  Furthermore, the political landscape is constantly evolving. A future administration with different priorities could potentially overturn this ban, leading to a back-and-forth situation.  \n\nA state-by-state approach allows for a more nuanced and enduring solution, empowering communities to shape their own destinies and create a more harmonious and just society.",
            "The concept of privacy in the digital age is complex. While MySpace, for instance, presents itself as a public platform, the expectation of complete visibility can be misleading. Individuals might not always anticipate the potential consequences of their online actions, especially when it comes to sensitive information.\n\nHowever, when considering the safety and security of students, the boundaries of privacy can become blurred. School officials, entrusted with the well-being of their students, have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent potential harm.\n\nIf accessing social media platforms like MySpace serves as a tool to identify and address threats, it could be argued that the potential benefit outweighs the infringement on privacy.  The idea of schools monitoring student activity online is controversial, but the goal of creating a safe learning environment for all is paramount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact. Once information is shared online, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to fully remove it. This permanence necessitates careful consideration of the content we post and the potential consequences it could have on our future.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between individual privacy and collective safety is a delicate and ongoing challenge in our increasingly interconnected world.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I felt a surge of anger and a strong desire for retribution. I believed that military action against those responsible was necessary and justified. However, with time, I've come to question the wisdom of our involvement. \n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding 9/11 may have overshadowed a careful consideration of the long-term consequences. It seems we entered the conflict hastily, lacking a comprehensive plan and unprepared for the complexities of the situation. \n\nLooking back, I believe the intervention has ultimately been counterproductive. The ongoing conflict has fueled instability and division within the region, hindering any possibility of lasting peace. It's become increasingly clear that external intervention is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted issues at play. \n\nThe culture of war in that part of the world is vastly different from our own. Their methods are often brutal and their motivations complex, making it difficult to achieve our objectives through traditional means.  \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now believe that a more diplomatic approach would have been more effective. We should focus on fostering understanding and cooperation rather than resorting to military force.  \n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and divisive affair. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider a more sustainable path towards peace. We need to prioritize diplomacy and work towards building bridges rather than walls."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a challenge in retaining its members. I believe this decline is partly due to its stance on certain contemporary issues.  \n\nWhile the Church holds strong, traditional views on topics like marriage equality, abortion, and contraception, these positions may not resonate with a modern audience.  \n\nMany individuals find the Church's perspective on these matters outdated and, consequently, feel alienated.  They seek a faith community that aligns with their own beliefs and values.  \n\nFor example, someone who supports abortion rights might feel uncomfortable within a church that vehemently opposes it. Similarly, someone who advocates for same-sex marriage might not find a welcoming environment in a Church that does not. \n\nPerhaps the Church could benefit from a more inclusive and adaptable approach to these complex issues. Embracing a wider range of perspectives might help bridge the gap and attract new generations of believers.  \n\nThe Church's assertion that priests are \"married to God\" and devote their lives solely to their ministry doesn't seem to adequately account for the human experience of wanting both a spiritual calling and a personal life.  Allowing priests to marry could potentially address this perceived disconnect and offer a more relatable model for aspiring clergy.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a conscious decision, and it wouldn't be fair to hold people responsible for something they are born with. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that a man and a woman's union is inherently different or superior.\n\nWhile I haven't extensively studied the legal and societal implications of same-sex marriage, I strongly feel that it's a matter of personal liberty and should be respected.  \n\nPerhaps the government's role shouldn't extend to regulating personal relationships, especially those that don't infringe upon the rights or well-being of others.  It seems to me that same-sex couples should be treated equally under the law and given the same opportunities for happiness and commitment as heterosexual couples.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness. Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions about same-sex relationships.  It's crucial to recognize that the dynamics within a committed partnership, regardless of sexual orientation, share many commonalities. \n\nOpponents sometimes cite concerns about societal impacts, particularly regarding children raised by same-sex couples. However, extensive research indicates that children thrive in loving and supportive environments, and the parenting styles of same-sex couples are demonstrably comparable to those of heterosexual couples.  \n\nThe issue of marriage equality transcends religious beliefs and delves into the realm of civil rights. Access to legal recognition and the benefits associated with marriage, such as healthcare and property rights, should be extended equally to all committed couples. \n\nAdvocating for a government-sanctioned distinction between different types of relationships is akin to segregation, perpetuating inequality under the guise of differing moral viewpoints.\n\nWhile personal beliefs are important, imposing them on an entire nation through legal means is both unethical and inconsistent with the principles of a diverse and inclusive society. The government should uphold the rights of all its citizens, ensuring that legal frameworks reflect the values of equality and justice.",
            "The experience I gained working at a hospital pharmacy during the summer truly shaped my perspective on drug legality. While I understand the concerns surrounding the illicit status of certain substances, I believe the classification of a drug as illegal shouldn't automatically preclude its potential medicinal benefits. \n\nThere are numerous controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, that are legally prescribed and utilized in pharmacies for their therapeutic value.  Denying the potential benefits of marijuana simply because of societal stigma seems illogical to me.  We should prioritize exploring its medicinal applications rather than dismissing them outright.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol presents a complex dilemma. Both substances can be misused, leading to negative consequences. However, I believe a measured approach is necessary.  Gradually integrating marijuana into legal frameworks, rather than a sudden legalization, might mitigate potential abuse while allowing for responsible use.  \n\nThe negative public perception surrounding marijuana stems largely from its illegal status.  It's important to recognize that marijuana's potential for harm pales in comparison to substances like heroin or cocaine.  By challenging the misconception of marijuana as inherently dangerous, we can create an environment where its responsible use, particularly for medical purposes, is more readily accepted.",
            "The Catholic Church has definitely evolved to suit the modern world. It's not as rigid as it once was. Looking back, when I was younger, every Sunday was a big event. I'd put on my best attire – a cute dress, matching shoes, and a purse to complete the look. That was the norm for me, especially since I attended a private school where I saw my friends every weekend. We'd all gather at church.\n\nNow, things have changed.  They've introduced a special mass for teenagers, keeping it concise at thirty minutes.  People dress much more casually, especially during summer. It's common to see people in beach attire, straight from the shore. You'll even find families rushing in late.  \n\nEven at the traditional morning masses, where I used to be meticulous about my appearance, people are now wearing jeans and khakis. While khakis are perfectly acceptable, the overall trend leans towards casual wear. \n\nPersonally, this shift in attire is the most noticeable change I've observed. As for other aspects of the church, that's the biggest thing that stands out to me. I'm not deeply involved in the church's politics, but these changes are evident in my experience.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests, I believe these issues are complex and deeply rooted.  \n\nI don't think simply allowing priests to marry or become female priests would have prevented these occurrences.  After all, pedophilia can affect anyone, regardless of marital status. It's a deeply personal struggle, and I believe it stems from individual factors rather than religious rules.  \n\nIt's important to remember that becoming a priest is a personal choice. Other religions allow for married clergy, such as the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both a religious calling and marriage, they might consider exploring those options.",
            "The initial premise of the Iraq War held some appeal, but the aftermath of September 11th cast a long shadow over the decision-making process. It appears that the Bush administration utilized  the attacks as a pretext to justify military action, linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and falsely claiming Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. This disconnect between stated justifications and reality deeply troubles me. The administration's actions seem to demonstrate a blatant disregard for truthfulness and transparency with the American people.\n\nColin Powell's subsequent admission that he harbored doubts about the evidence presented at the UN further reinforces this concern.  To mislead the nation on such a momentous occasion is, in my view, a grave offense, bordering on impeachable.  \n\nThere's a pervasive feeling that the Bush administration's approach towards the Constitution has been one of erosion since September 11th.  It's been suggested, albeit by those outside the administration, that their ambition from the outset included military intervention.  \n\nThe motivations behind the war remain complex and multifaceted.  One theory posits a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein stemming from the previous administration's dealings with Iraq.  Another proposes an underlying desire to secure American energy interests in the region, a strategy I find deeply problematic. \n\nThe duration of the conflict has undeniably caused immense suffering, and a hasty withdrawal could exacerbate the situation by triggering civil strife and further bloodshed.  The current plan, involving a coalition of neighboring nations, presents its own set of challenges.  It raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and the potential for long-term instability. \n\nThe interim government's fragility is evident, with the Parliament seemingly ineffective and the Prime Minister lacking substantial control. The presence of powerful factions like Muqtada al-Sadr's party further complicates the political landscape, creating a volatile environment rife with internal conflict.",
            "The ongoing conflict in Iraq presents a complex dilemma. While I understand the initial motivation for intervention, I believe the current situation lacks a clear purpose. The absence of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises questions about the legitimacy of our involvement. \n\nThe stated goals of fostering democracy and securing energy resources seem at odds with the reality on the ground.  Attempts to impose our political system on a culture vastly different from our own risk exacerbating tensions and fostering resentment.  The potential for long-term instability and the erosion of our national image as a result of continued involvement are significant concerns. \n\nFurthermore, the human cost of this protracted conflict is undeniable. The lives of both American soldiers and Iraqi civilians are at stake. It's essential to consider the well-being of all parties involved and explore alternative paths to a peaceful resolution.",
            "The issue of legalization presents a complex dilemma, especially considering the foundational principles of the United States. I firmly believe that the Constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state should serve as a guiding principle in this matter. The document explicitly outlines this separation, and any attempt to legislate on this issue would, in my view, constitute a direct challenge to this established tenet. \n\nFurthermore, imposing legal restrictions on a practice that is deeply intertwined with religious beliefs raises serious concerns about the government's overreach.  Different religious communities hold diverse perspectives on this matter, and attempting to codify one specific belief system into law would inevitably disadvantage others. \n\nThe Constitution has long been lauded for promoting religious tolerance, and enacting an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very foundation.  It's crucial to remember that the Constitution's purpose is primarily to safeguard individual liberties and limit government power.  An amendment aimed at restricting individual choices rather than government actions would be a significant departure from this principle.\n\nTherefore, I maintain that the government should abstain from interfering in this domain.  It is not the role of the state to dictate the internal practices of religious institutions.  Ultimately, the decision should rest with individual religious communities, guided by their own doctrines and beliefs.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  While the initial justification for the invasion centered around concerns about weapons of mass destruction and links to terrorism, many believe the true motives were more multifaceted.  \n\nThere's a strong argument to be made that the government's portrayal of the conflict to the American public was not entirely transparent.  The emotional fallout from the September 11th attacks was undoubtedly exploited to garner public support for the war, potentially overshadowing a more nuanced understanding of the situation. \n\nPersonally, I hold reservations about preemptive military action in general.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the historical mistakes made during the Vietnam War, highlighting the dangers of underestimating the complexities of foreign intervention.  \n\nThe high number of American casualties is a tragic consequence of the conflict, and the long-term ramifications of the removal of the Iraqi government have proven to be far-reaching and difficult to predict.\n\nThe United States' attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq has been a challenging endeavor, mirroring the difficulties encountered during the Vietnam War.  The complexities of nation-building and the inherent resistance to foreign influence often lead to protracted and costly conflicts.\n\nThe war has raised important ethical questions about the role of the United States in global affairs.  The decision to intervene militarily should not be taken lightly, and a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences, both short-term and long-term, is essential.\n\nI believe that a more thorough and transparent approach to foreign policy is crucial, one that prioritizes diplomacy and international cooperation whenever possible.  The Iraq War serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict and the need for careful consideration before resorting to military force.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage is clear: I wholeheartedly support it.  This belief stems from a fundamental understanding that personal preferences, particularly regarding relationships, should be respected and protected.  \n\nIncreasing scientific evidence suggests a biological basis for sexual orientation, further emphasizing the argument against restricting rights based on something beyond an individual's control. Denying individuals equal rights due to their inherent nature is, in my view, deeply inhumane.  I've always been a vocal advocate for marriage equality.\n\nPolitics and government should not dictate personal choices like marriage. It's a matter of individual and familial autonomy, not a public issue.  Even in my own neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who, despite not being legally recognized, live fulfilling lives just like any other family. They contribute to their community, raise children, and deserve the same legal recognition and protections.  \n\nWhen public figures attempt to impose their own interpretations of marriage, it feels intrusive and dismissive of the lived experiences of countless individuals.  \n\nResearch increasingly points to a biological predisposition for sexual orientation. It's not a choice, and it's not a result of sociological factors. This biological basis further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nMarriage, at its core, is a personal commitment. While heterosexual couples can easily choose to marry discreetly, the same isn't true for same-sex couples.  Their decisions are often subject to public scrutiny and debate, highlighting the need for greater acceptance and legal equality.  Marriage should be a private matter, not a public spectacle subject to political and social agendas.",
            "The digital landscape presents unique challenges regarding privacy and responsibility.  Once information is shared online, it enters the public sphere and can significantly influence how others perceive an individual. This raises important questions about the consequences of our digital footprints. \n\nFor instance, as a resident advisor, I've encountered situations where online posts, even those intended as jokes, have been misinterpreted and raised concerns.  The internet's wide reach means that information can quickly spread beyond the intended audience, potentially leading to misunderstandings and unintended consequences. \n\nSchools, in particular, face the difficult task of balancing the need to protect students with the right to free expression.  While it's crucial to prevent potential harm, it's equally important to respect students' privacy.  \n\nA delicate line exists between monitoring for safety concerns and overstepping boundaries.  While schools may be obligated to investigate credible threats, it's essential to avoid intrusive surveillance practices.  Open communication and trust between students and school officials are vital in navigating these complex issues.  \n\nUltimately, individuals bear responsibility for the content they share online.  Before posting, it's important to consider the potential impact on oneself and others.  The internet offers a powerful platform for connection and expression, but it's crucial to use it responsibly and ethically.",
            "The war's duration has become a significant concern for me. While the initial intention, to establish democracy in a nation lacking democratic principles, seemed noble, I believe we've strayed from that original purpose. \n\nIt feels as though the conflict has evolved into a demonstration of power, rather than a genuine effort to promote democracy. Concerns exist regarding the motivations behind the war's initiation, particularly potential connections to past disputes between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein. \n\nIf the primary objective was indeed to bring democracy to a country lacking political fairness, that would be a justifiable reason. However, any personal agendas involved would undoubtedly undermine the ethical foundation of the war.\n\nDespite the initial impact and statement made in the early months, the prolonged nature of the conflict—spanning several years—is deeply troubling. It appears that the war has become self-perpetuating, with the focus shifting from achieving a clear objective to simply continuing the fight, seeking a decisive victory.\n\nThe war's extended duration has become detrimental.  The country's government and its people must eventually be responsible for their own governance. We've reached a point where our continued involvement is draining our own economy, diverting resources from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure, education, and healthcare. Billions are being spent on a conflict that no longer serves its original purpose. \n\nIt's crucial to prioritize domestic needs and allocate resources effectively. The ongoing war diverts essential funds from vital areas that require immediate attention.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one.  While it's true that information shared on platforms like Myspace is generally public, there are still ethical considerations.  For instance, while users choose to share information, it's unsettling to think that someone could misuse that information, especially to harm others.  \n\nThere's a fine line between responsible monitoring and unwarranted intrusion.  It's difficult to imagine a school system effectively monitoring student activity on social media without crossing that line.  Such a system could easily lead to unfair targeting and discrimination.  \n\nHowever, the potential for harm is real.  I've personally experienced the unsettling feeling of strangers contacting me on platforms like Facebook, knowing personal details about me that I hadn't publicly shared. It highlights the vulnerability of online information and the need for caution.\n\nThe issue of schools banning social media use by students raises questions about freedom of expression and the role of technology in education.  While I understand the potential dangers, I believe outright bans might not be the most effective solution.  Perhaps a more nuanced approach, focusing on digital literacy and responsible online behavior, would be more beneficial.",
            "The Iraq War has been a deeply complex issue, and my perspective on it has evolved over time. While I understand the initial justifications for the intervention, the ongoing situation has raised serious concerns.  \n\nPublic opinion, both domestically and internationally, has consistently indicated widespread disapproval of the war's conduct and its lasting consequences. Polls reveal that a significant majority of Americans, Iraqis, and individuals globally believe the war was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, advocating for a swift withdrawal.\n\nThe war's impact has been undeniably devastating, exacerbating existing tensions and instability in the region.  The cultural and political differences between the United States and the Middle East make it challenging to impose solutions from the outside. Attempts to establish democracy in a region with deeply entrenched traditions and power structures have proven to be deeply problematic.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been based on a thorough assessment of the potential ramifications. The consequences, both immediate and long-term, have been far-reaching and have created a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe possibility of a complete withdrawal from Iraq remains a contentious topic. While I recognize the complexities involved, I believe it is crucial to prioritize the voices of the Iraqi people. Their desire for self-determination and their calls for our departure should be seriously considered.  \n\nA gradual withdrawal, conducted responsibly and in consultation with Iraqi leaders, might be a more palatable option. However, the urgency for a definitive exit strategy is undeniable.  The consequences of prolonged military involvement continue to weigh heavily on both Iraq and the United States.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it often manifests differently depending on the field and societal expectations. While progress has been made towards gender equality, certain industries and roles continue to exhibit biases.\n\n For example, women frequently encounter a \"glass ceiling\" where, despite qualifications, they may face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to historical gender roles and societal perceptions. Similarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children often encounter prejudice and societal pressure to conform to traditional masculinity norms.\n\nThe fashion industry presents another example, where male designers may be perceived as less credible or knowledgeable simply because they do not adhere to stereotypically masculine aesthetics. These examples highlight the complex and multifaceted nature of gender discrimination, demonstrating how societal expectations and ingrained biases can impact individuals regardless of their gender.\n\nWhile change is gradual, the increasing representation of women in leadership roles and the growing acceptance of diverse family structures suggest that societal attitudes are evolving.  It is crucial to continue challenging these biases and promote inclusion in all aspects of society.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex, encompassing both legal and social implications.  \n\nDecriminalization, as opposed to full legalization, shifts the focus from criminal offenses to civil infractions. This means individuals caught with marijuana might face citations similar to traffic violations, rather than arrest and prosecution.  While this diminishes the immediate legal consequences, long-term ramifications like employment hurdles remain a concern.\n\nHowever, decriminalization presents financial benefits for municipalities. The costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration can be substantial. By diverting resources from marijuana enforcement, communities could potentially allocate funds towards essential services such as education, social programs, and homelessness support.\n\nThe argument for decriminalization gains traction in areas with more progressive social values, where financial considerations and a desire for social reform are prioritized. Denver, for example, has embraced decriminalization, potentially freeing up resources for community betterment.\n\nHowever, concerns remain about the potential for increased marijuana use if legalized, mirroring the accessibility of cigarettes.  \n\nThe societal stigma surrounding marijuana use also persists, and widespread availability could lead to discomfort and awkwardness in certain contexts. \n\nUltimately, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, and its impact on individual lifestyles and decision-making is multifaceted.  A nuanced approach is essential when considering the legalization debate, acknowledging both its potential benefits and drawbacks.",
            "While I respect the enduring traditions of the Catholic Church, I believe that maintaining relevance in a changing world requires adaptability. There are certain aspects of Catholicism, such as the emphasis on weekly church attendance and strict adherence to doctrine, that can feel exclusionary.  \n\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith marriage faced opposition from the Church because my father was Episcopalian. This experience highlighted a perceived contradiction between the Church's teachings of love and acceptance and its reluctance to embrace individuals from diverse religious backgrounds.\n\nFurthermore, some Catholic practices seem outdated, particularly regarding the celibacy requirement for priests. While I support the idea of allowing priests to marry, I recognize that such a change might not necessarily address issues of misconduct. \n\nUltimately, I believe that the root causes of such problems lie beyond marital status and require multifaceted solutions. It's important to remember that individuals who engage in harmful acts, such as child abuse, often do so regardless of their personal circumstances.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage is undeniably complex, residing at the intersection of deeply held religious beliefs and the fundamental principles of individual liberty and equality. \n\nDetermining the appropriate legal framework for marriage presents a significant challenge. On one hand, the separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, suggesting that the government should not dictate religious practices or doctrines. On the other hand, marriage has historically been recognized as a societal institution with legal and social implications, leading to questions about the role of government in defining and regulating it.\n\nSome argue that marriage should be solely a religious sacrament, while others believe it should be a civil contract governed by the state.  The potential for legal recognition of same-sex marriages raises concerns about the impact on religious freedom and traditional definitions of marriage.\n\nIt's important to consider the diverse perspectives on this issue and engage in respectful dialogue to find a solution that balances the rights of all individuals.  While I believe that civil unions offer a viable alternative to marriage for same-sex couples, I acknowledge the strong emotional and personal significance that marriage holds for many. \n\nUltimately, the question of whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage should be decided through a thoughtful and inclusive process that respects both individual liberties and the principles of equality.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has shaped my perspective on homosexuality. It's a complex issue for me, as I value my friendships with individuals who identify as gay. While I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle, I believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to determine its own laws regarding marriage. The United States is a diverse nation with varying political leanings.  Democratic-leaning states, for instance, are more likely to support same-sex marriage, reflecting the values of their constituents.  \n\nIndividuals choosing to reside in a particular state should respect the legal framework and social norms established by that state.  Conversely, I believe a national mandate on such a sensitive topic would be inappropriate, as it would disregard the diverse viewpoints and cultural contexts across the country.\n\nI firmly believe in equal opportunities for all citizens, regardless of their sexual orientation.  Therefore, I support a state-by-state approach to legalization, allowing each community to make decisions that align with their values and beliefs. This approach fosters a more inclusive and accommodating society while respecting individual autonomy and local control.  \n\nThe current federal ban on gay marriage, in my opinion, oversteps the bounds of federal authority. It's a matter best left to the individual states to decide.  Furthermore, the political landscape is constantly evolving. A future administration with different priorities could potentially overturn this ban, leading to a back-and-forth situation.  \n\nA state-by-state approach allows for a more nuanced and enduring solution, empowering communities to shape their own destinies and create a more harmonious and just society.",
            "The concept of privacy in the digital age is complex. While MySpace, for instance, presents itself as a public platform, the expectation of complete visibility can be misleading. Individuals might not always anticipate the potential consequences of their online actions, especially when it comes to sensitive information.\n\nHowever, when considering the safety and security of students, the boundaries of privacy can become blurred. School officials, entrusted with the well-being of their students, have a responsibility to take proactive measures to prevent potential harm.\n\nIf accessing social media platforms like MySpace serves as a tool to identify and address threats, it could be argued that the potential benefit outweighs the infringement on privacy.  The idea of schools monitoring student activity online is controversial, but the goal of creating a safe learning environment for all is paramount.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet has a lasting impact. Once information is shared online, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to fully remove it. This permanence necessitates careful consideration of the content we post and the potential consequences it could have on our future.\n\nUltimately, striking a balance between individual privacy and collective safety is a delicate and ongoing challenge in our increasingly interconnected world.",
            "The events of September 11th had a profound impact on my perspective. Initially, I felt a surge of anger and a strong desire for retribution. I believed that military action against those responsible was necessary and justified. However, with time, I've come to question the wisdom of our involvement. \n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding 9/11 may have overshadowed a careful consideration of the long-term consequences. It seems we entered the conflict hastily, lacking a comprehensive plan and unprepared for the complexities of the situation. \n\nLooking back, I believe the intervention has ultimately been counterproductive. The ongoing conflict has fueled instability and division within the region, hindering any possibility of lasting peace. It's become increasingly clear that external intervention is unlikely to resolve the deep-rooted issues at play. \n\nThe culture of war in that part of the world is vastly different from our own. Their methods are often brutal and their motivations complex, making it difficult to achieve our objectives through traditional means.  \n\nWhile I understand the initial impulse to retaliate, I now believe that a more diplomatic approach would have been more effective. We should focus on fostering understanding and cooperation rather than resorting to military force.  \n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and divisive affair. It's time for us to reevaluate our strategy and consider a more sustainable path towards peace. We need to prioritize diplomacy and work towards building bridges rather than walls."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing challenges in maintaining its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues plays a role in this.  \n\nThe Church's traditionally conservative views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception may not resonate with a growing segment of society that holds more progressive beliefs. While the Church is entitled to its positions, these views can appear outdated to some, potentially leading to a disconnect with younger generations and those who find themselves at odds with these doctrines.\n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective on these matters, it might be better positioned to connect with a wider audience and prevent further decline in its following.  \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable or marginalized within a religious institution that opposes these values.\n\nThe Church's stance on such issues can create a sense of exclusion for those who hold differing views, potentially driving them away from the faith.\n\nIt's worth considering if allowing married priests or ordaining women could address some of these concerns and foster a more inclusive environment.  \n\nWhile these measures might not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more relatable and welcoming atmosphere for a broader range of individuals.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unfair to hold people accountable for something inherent to their identity. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhile I've given this topic some thought, it's important to recognize that personal experiences shape our perspectives. I identify as straight, and while I can't fully grasp the complexities of being gay, I can empathize with the desire for equal rights and recognition. \n\nI also believe the federal government should not be involved in regulating personal matters like marriage. It's a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be to protect individual liberties rather than dictate personal choices.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears.  \n\nOne common concern is that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow undermine traditional family structures.  However, the nature of a loving, committed relationship transcends sexual orientation.  Just as a coin has two sides, both sides of the same fundamental value,  heterosexual and homosexual relationships share core elements – commitment, love, and partnership.\n\nBeyond the emotional aspect, there are significant legal and social implications.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry has a profound impact on their access to essential rights and benefits.  For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and property ownership, legally recognized partners are afforded crucial protections that unmarried partners lack.  \n\nThe issue of religious objections is also frequently raised. While individuals are certainly entitled to their beliefs, government policies should not be based on specific religious doctrines.  Segregation based on sexual orientation is unjust and perpetuates inequality.  Marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not a religious sacrament.\n\nFurthermore, studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples.  Arguments suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are somehow disadvantaged are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe federal government has a responsibility to ensure equal rights and protections for all its citizens.  Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, demonstrating that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are valued and respected members of society.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer provided me with valuable insight into the complexities surrounding drug legality. I've observed firsthand that  a substance's legal status doesn't necessarily reflect its potential therapeutic benefits. \n\nWhile I believe making illicit drugs readily accessible to the public is unwise, I do advocate for their controlled use in medical settings.  Many medications, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse, yet they are essential tools for managing pain and other conditions.  Denying potential therapeutic benefits solely based on societal stigma, as is often the case with marijuana, seems counterproductive.  \n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is difficult, as both substances have the potential for abuse. However, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, responsible marijuana use, when properly regulated, may offer therapeutic advantages.  \n\nI envision a gradual approach to marijuana legalization, starting with controlled medical use. This phased implementation would allow for careful monitoring and regulation, mitigating potential risks while allowing patients to access potential benefits. Removing the societal stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to fostering responsible use and encouraging open discussions about its potential applications.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However,  it's essential to recognize that it's not inherently as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting the narrative and promoting responsible use, we can unlock the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana while minimizing potential risks.",
            "The Church has definitely evolved to fit into the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest outfits – cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses.  \n\nIt was quite a routine, especially since I went to a private school where many of my friends also attended church. We'd often see each other there on weekends.  But things have changed. Now, they have a special mass geared towards teenagers, shortened to thirty minutes. People dress much more casually, especially during the summer. I've seen people arrive straight from the beach!  Families rush in late, and even the morning masses, which I used to dress up for, now see people in jeans and khakis.  \n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other aspects of the Church, I primarily observe these changes.  I don't have a deep understanding of the Church's internal politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't believe these issues could have been prevented simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and the attraction towards young children is a complex issue.\n\nI think becoming a priest is a personal choice, and some religions allow married clergy, like the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both faith and marriage, perhaps they could explore other denominations.\n\nMy perspective is that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. People aren't simply \"born\" that way, and it's not solely a result of upbringing.  While circumstances might play a role, genetics seem to be a significant factor, and marriage wouldn't necessarily eliminate that predisposition.\n\nIf the Church was aware of these issues and attempted to cover them up, that would be deeply wrong. However, I don't believe they were always aware of every instance.",
            "The initial concept held some appeal, but the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow.  It seemed as though the Iraq War was, in part, a response to those events. The Bush administration initially linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction - claims that have since been proven false. This deeply troubled me, and frankly, the Iraq War fills me with anger.\n\nThe Bush administration's handling of the situation deeply concerns me. I believe they misled the American people and have yet to acknowledge their actions. Even Colin Powell, who gave that prominent presentation at the UN, has stated that he wasn't fully convinced by the evidence even while delivering it. To me, this constitutes a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense.  I feel the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to diminish its importance, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards war.\n\nThere have been allegations, made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, that the younger Bush had personal motivations for targeting Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration.  It's also been suggested that securing access to energy resources was a contributing factor, a rather manipulative approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe duration of the conflict is unacceptable.  While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further loss of life, the current path forward seems problematic as well.  The proposed solution involves a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, intervening to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could ultimately create further complications.\n\nThe interim government appears to be crumbling, and the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable.  The Prime Minister seems to have limited influence over the political process.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we were actively combating not long ago, now hold significant power within the Iraqi Parliament.  The political landscape is fraught with tension due to these competing factions vying for control.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I acknowledge the initial impetus for the conflict, which stemmed from the tragic events of 9/11, I find myself questioning the continued justification for our involvement.  \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict.  Furthermore, the stated goals of promoting democracy and securing oil resources appear to be at odds with the reality on the ground. The protracted nature of the war has resulted in significant civilian casualties and instability, casting a shadow over our commitment to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe process of nation-building is inherently challenging, and attempting to impose Western democratic ideals upon a culture with deeply rooted traditions may ultimately prove counterproductive. The potential for resentment and resistance to our intervention is a serious concern.  \n\nMoreover, the ongoing conflict has fueled extremist ideologies and exacerbated sectarian tensions, creating a breeding ground for further violence.  While I understand the desire to protect American interests and support our troops, I believe that a sustained military presence in Iraq is not a sustainable solution. \n\nA more measured approach, focused on diplomacy, economic development, and supporting local initiatives for peace and reconciliation, may offer a more promising path forward.",
            "The question of legality regarding this particular issue is one that deeply concerns me. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is paramount. It explicitly delineates the boundaries between religious institutions and governmental authority, and I feel any attempt to encroach upon those boundaries would be a direct violation of this foundational principle.\n\nThose advocating for its criminalization seem to be prioritizing the beliefs of a specific religious group over others. While it's true that certain denominations, such as many Catholics and Christians, oppose it,  it's essential to recognize the diversity of viewpoints within these faiths.  Furthermore, it is not the government's role to dictate what religious organizations can or cannot deem permissible.\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom is a cornerstone of American society. It allows for a multiplicity of beliefs and practices to flourish. Introducing an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very principle, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on individual liberties. \n\nI firmly believe that the government should remain neutral on this matter.  The decision regarding its legality should rest with the respective religious communities, not with elected officials whose personal beliefs may not reflect the diverse perspectives within their constituencies. \n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment is unclear. It's difficult to predict whether it would have a positive or negative effect on society or the economy.  However, it's crucial to prioritize the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and avoid actions that could undermine religious freedom.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  From the outset, there were questions about the government's justification for the invasion.  While the attacks of September 11th understandably sparked a desire for retribution, the connection between those events and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best.  The administration's rhetoric seemed to blur the lines, capitalizing on the public's fear and anger to garner support for military action.\n\nPersonally, I'm deeply opposed to war, particularly preemptive strikes.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War.  A significant number of American soldiers have perished, a tragic consequence of a conflict that seemed to lack clear objectives and a well-defined exit strategy.  The US government's failure to anticipate the post-invasion chaos and the rise of insurgency highlights a lack of foresight and planning.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic government in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved to be a monumental challenge.  This parallels the difficulties faced during the Vietnam War, where the US attempted to impose its political system on a deeply divided nation. Both conflicts demonstrate the complexities of nation-building and the unintended consequences of intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq has dragged on for years, with significant costs in terms of both American lives and resources.  The training of Iraqi security forces remains a work in progress, and the future of the country remains uncertain. The initial claims about weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded, further fueling skepticism about the government's motives.\n\nThe question of whether the US should continue its involvement in Iraq remains a deeply contentious one.  While some argue for a complete withdrawal, others believe it is crucial to see the conflict through to its conclusion.  Ultimately, the decision involves weighing the human cost against the potential benefits of a stable and democratic Iraq.  It is a decision that demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and growing evidence suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis rather than being solely a sociological construct.  \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control seems fundamentally unjust.  I believe government should not interfere in these personal matters. Marriage is a private affair, a decision made between two people, not a matter for public or governmental intervention.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and raise families, just like any other couple. They contribute to our community and deserve the same recognition and legal protections as everyone else.  \n\nThe idea that political figures should dictate who can and cannot marry based on their interpretation of religious texts feels both antiquated and intrusive.  \n\nScientific research increasingly points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, suggesting it's not a choice but an inherent aspect of a person's identity.  This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current situation highlights a double standard. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without public scrutiny, while same-sex couples face intense media attention and societal judgment simply for seeking the same right. Marriage should be a private and personal matter, not a public spectacle.",
            "The nature of online platforms necessitates a careful consideration of the content we share. Once something is posted on the internet, it enters a public domain accessible to a vast audience. This accessibility carries significant implications, as online content can shape perceptions and influence opinions. \n\nAs someone who has worked in a residential advisor role, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online postings.  Expressing thoughts about harmful actions, even in jest, can be misconstrued and lead to serious repercussions. Schools, for example,  have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and may act upon information gleaned from online platforms if it raises concerns.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential for misuse of online information, it's equally crucial to recognize the importance of responsible disclosure.\n\nIndividuals should be mindful of the permanence of online content and consider the potential impact it may have on their reputation and relationships. Schools, while obligated to address potential threats, should navigate this delicate balance with sensitivity and respect for student privacy.",
            "The prolonged nature of the conflict deeply concerns me. While the initial aims, restoring democracy in a nation lacking fair governance, seemed noble, I believe we have strayed from that original purpose. The conflict now feels driven by an urge to assert global dominance, a pursuit of power rather than principle.\n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's initiation.  The historical tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein raise doubts about the purity of the original intentions.  If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a country lacking a just political system, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, it undermines the moral basis of the war.\n\nThe initial stages, the decisive military action, conveyed a powerful message. Yet, the conflict's continued escalation, stretching for years, seems excessive.  \n\nIf our goal was to liberate a nation under a tyrannical regime, then it was a worthy endeavor. However, I fear our rationale has become muddled and distorted over time. We appear to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than a just resolution.\n\nThe conflict has undoubtedly lingered long enough. It's time for the nation to take responsibility for its own future. We've been draining our economy, spending billions while neglecting domestic issues like poverty and inadequate infrastructure. These are pressing concerns that deserve our financial attention.\n\nBillions are being funneled into a prolonged war, diverting resources from crucial domestic needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.  These are areas that require immediate attention and investment.\n\nSpending taxpayer money on a conflict that has lost its original purpose is morally and financially irresponsible. It's time to end this war and redirect our resources towards addressing the critical challenges facing our own nation.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one. While it's true that information shared publicly on platforms like Myspace is accessible to anyone, the question arises about the boundaries of acceptable access.  \n\nFor instance, while a user might choose to make their profile visible to friends, it's unsettling to consider the potential for individuals to exploit this openness for malicious purposes. The scenario you described, where someone's online activity prevented a potentially dangerous situation, raises ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhile it's impractical to monitor every student's profile constantly, the possibility of targeted monitoring in specific circumstances, such as when there are credible threats, presents a difficult balance between security and individual privacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it disconcerting that personal information can be so readily accessible online.  I've encountered situations where strangers have contacted me through platforms like Facebook, possessing details about me that they shouldn't have.  \n\nThis highlights the vulnerability of online spaces and the need for caution. While these platforms offer valuable opportunities for communication and connection, it's crucial to be mindful of the information we share and the potential consequences.\n\nThe situation you mentioned regarding high schools banning Myspace is also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions have the authority to regulate students' online activities outside of school grounds.  This issue touches upon the evolving nature of privacy in the digital age and the challenges of navigating these complex boundaries.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift to the current realities and potential solutions.  \n\nA significant global consensus, reflected in polls conducted both within the United States, Iraq, and internationally, indicates a strong belief that the war was a misguided endeavor. This sentiment is shared by a majority of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who advocate for a swift withdrawal.  \n\nThe war's consequences have been undeniably devastating, both before and after our involvement. The intricate cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East pose significant challenges to effective engagement.  Imposing democratic ideals on a region with its own distinct cultural and historical context has proven to be a problematic approach.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential repercussions. The current situation necessitates a strategic and measured withdrawal. \n\nDespite the administration's potential arguments for continued presence, I believe a phased withdrawal over the course of a year or slightly longer would be a more responsible course of action.  \n\nUltimately, the Iraqi people themselves have a crucial stake in their future. If we were to consult them directly and they expressed a desire for our departure, it would be both ethically responsible and acknowledge their right to self-determination. While this may present challenges, it would ultimately be a more transparent and potentially more constructive approach.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it manifests in ways that extend beyond traditional gender roles. While women continue to face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to societal biases and the \"glass ceiling,\" men also encounter discrimination in certain fields. \n\nFor example, stay-at-home fathers often face societal pressure and judgment for not adhering to traditional masculine roles, despite their desire to prioritize family life. Similarly, men in the fashion industry sometimes struggle to be taken seriously due to prevailing stereotypes about masculinity and creative expression.\n\nThese examples illustrate that gender discrimination is not a monolithic issue but rather a complex web of societal perceptions and expectations that can disadvantage individuals based on their gender and chosen path. \n\nProgress has been made in challenging these biases, with women increasingly entering leadership positions and stay-at-home fathers gaining greater acceptance. However, change is gradual, and continued efforts are needed to dismantle deeply ingrained societal norms and promote equality for all.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex. While some advocate for full legalization, others, particularly in financially struggling communities, oppose it due to the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration. Decriminalization, on the other hand, shifts the focus from criminal penalties to civil citations, similar to traffic violations. \n\nThis approach reduces the severity of consequences while still acknowledging the potential for misuse.  Supporters of decriminalization argue that it frees up resources for municipalities to invest in vital public services like education, social programs, and homelessness assistance. They also contend that it addresses the societal stigma surrounding marijuana use, allowing for a more open and honest discussion about its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, opponents express concerns about the normalization of marijuana use and potential for increased accessibility, leading to public health and safety issues. They worry about the influence on youth, the potential for impaired driving, and the normalization of drug use in general.\n\nThe economic impact of marijuana legalization or decriminalization is a significant factor in the debate. Proponents highlight the potential for tax revenue and job creation, while opponents emphasize the costs associated with potential increases in healthcare expenses, addiction treatment, and social services.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana involves a careful consideration of various societal, economic, and ethical factors.",
            "While I recognize the value of tradition and the historical significance of the Catholic Church's practices, I believe there are aspects of their doctrine that need to be re-evaluated in light of modern values. \n\nOne area of concern is the rigidity surrounding religious observance. While I understand the importance of faith, I feel that a more inclusive approach to religious practice would be beneficial. For instance, the expectation that every Catholic attend mass weekly and adhere strictly to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion towards those who don't perfectly conform. \n\nThis lack of acceptance extends to individuals of other faiths.  My own parents experienced this firsthand when they were denied a Catholic marriage due to my father's Episcopalian background. This incident highlights a hypocrisy in the Church's teachings, as loving others is a core principle yet, in practice, acceptance of those outside the Catholic faith is limited.\n\nThe discrepancy between doctrine and practice is also evident in the ongoing debate surrounding priestly celibacy. While the Church maintains this requirement, many argue that allowing priests to marry could potentially address concerns about abuse of power.  \n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the issue of abuse is complex and multifaceted. While some might argue that permitting marriage could potentially mitigate certain risks, it is unlikely to be a complete solution.  The root causes of such abuse lie in deeper societal issues and individual pathology, and addressing them requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma for me.  I'm still grappling with the multifaceted implications, finding it difficult to definitively say whether one side is more right than the other.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage itself.  Drawing clear boundaries without causing offense to any group is a formidable task. \n\nMy personal inclination leans towards viewing marriage as a civil union, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious sacraments like baptism, it shouldn't dictate the specific form a marriage takes.  Civil unions, in my view, adequately recognize the commitment between two individuals.\n\nThe government should refrain from  scrutinizing the nature of a union, focusing instead on the fundamental fact that two people have chosen to join together.  If all states can reach a consensus on this matter, I believe they should advocate for federal legislation recognizing civil unions nationwide.\n\nHowever, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment aiming to ban same-sex marriage.  Altering the constitution for this purpose seems disproportionate to the issue. While it holds significant importance for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic measure.  The constitution should be amended only for matters of truly paramount national concern.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has given me a complex perspective on homosexuality. While I value the relationships of my many gay friends, I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to decide its own stance on marriage equality.  Given the diverse political landscapes across the nation, it's natural that states with differing viewpoints will approach this topic in distinct ways.  A state with a predominantly Democratic population might naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and residents of that state should respect the decisions made by their elected representatives.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to live according to their beliefs and values within the framework of their chosen community.  Therefore, I support the right of each state to determine its own marriage laws. I also believe that such a system avoids imposing a single viewpoint on the entire country, allowing for a more nuanced and localized approach to this complex issue.",
            "The concept of privacy online is complex, especially when it comes to student safety. While it's true that platforms like Myspace are intended for public sharing, the potential consequences of posts can be significant. School officials, in their role to ensure a safe learning environment, often have to navigate this delicate balance.\n\nIf information found online indicates a potential threat to student well-being, it's understandable why officials would want to investigate. This isn't about snooping; it's about taking proactive measures to prevent tragedies.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet leaves a permanent digital footprint. What seems like a harmless post today could have repercussions down the line. It's wise to exercise caution and consider the potential impact of our online actions.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with both individuals and institutions to create a safe and secure online space.  Schools must protect their students, and students must understand the implications of their online presence.",
            "The aftermath of September 11th had a profound impact on my views regarding the war. Initially, driven by a deeply personal connection to the tragedy, I strongly supported military intervention. I believed that a forceful response was necessary to punish those responsible and prevent further attacks. However, as time passed, I began to question the wisdom of our actions.\n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding the event, I realized, might have clouded our judgment. We seemed to act impulsively, lacking a comprehensive strategy or understanding of the long-term consequences. The lack of preparation was evident, and the conflict ultimately backfired, failing to achieve its intended objectives.\n\nMy perspective shifted significantly. Observing the ongoing conflict, I was struck by the internal divisions within the region. It became clear that external intervention might be counterproductive if the primary focus should be on fostering unity and stability within the country itself.\n\nThe complexities of war, particularly in that specific context, became more apparent. The cultural and societal differences led to misunderstandings and unintended consequences.  The motivations and goals of all parties involved were deeply intertwined, and the situation was far more nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nReflecting on the war's impact, I see it as a complex and multifaceted failure. While the initial intention might have been noble, the execution was flawed. The lack of a clear plan, the emotional underpinnings, and the cultural misunderstandings all contributed to a situation that continues to be fraught with challenges."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing challenges in maintaining its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues plays a role in this.  \n\nThe Church's traditionally conservative views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception may not resonate with a growing segment of society that holds more progressive beliefs. While the Church is entitled to its positions, these views can appear outdated to some, potentially leading to a disconnect with younger generations and those who find themselves at odds with these doctrines.\n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective on these matters, it might be better positioned to connect with a wider audience and prevent further decline in its following.  \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable or marginalized within a religious institution that opposes these values.\n\nThe Church's stance on such issues can create a sense of exclusion for those who hold differing views, potentially driving them away from the faith.\n\nIt's worth considering if allowing married priests or ordaining women could address some of these concerns and foster a more inclusive environment.  \n\nWhile these measures might not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more relatable and welcoming atmosphere for a broader range of individuals.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unfair to hold people accountable for something inherent to their identity. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhile I've given this topic some thought, it's important to recognize that personal experiences shape our perspectives. I identify as straight, and while I can't fully grasp the complexities of being gay, I can empathize with the desire for equal rights and recognition. \n\nI also believe the federal government should not be involved in regulating personal matters like marriage. It's a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be to protect individual liberties rather than dictate personal choices.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears.  \n\nOne common concern is that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow undermine traditional family structures.  However, the nature of a loving, committed relationship transcends sexual orientation.  Just as a coin has two sides, both sides of the same fundamental value,  heterosexual and homosexual relationships share core elements – commitment, love, and partnership.\n\nBeyond the emotional aspect, there are significant legal and social implications.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry has a profound impact on their access to essential rights and benefits.  For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and property ownership, legally recognized partners are afforded crucial protections that unmarried partners lack.  \n\nThe issue of religious objections is also frequently raised. While individuals are certainly entitled to their beliefs, government policies should not be based on specific religious doctrines.  Segregation based on sexual orientation is unjust and perpetuates inequality.  Marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not a religious sacrament.\n\nFurthermore, studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples.  Arguments suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are somehow disadvantaged are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe federal government has a responsibility to ensure equal rights and protections for all its citizens.  Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, demonstrating that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are valued and respected members of society.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer provided me with valuable insight into the complexities surrounding drug legality. I've observed firsthand that  a substance's legal status doesn't necessarily reflect its potential therapeutic benefits. \n\nWhile I believe making illicit drugs readily accessible to the public is unwise, I do advocate for their controlled use in medical settings.  Many medications, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse, yet they are essential tools for managing pain and other conditions.  Denying potential therapeutic benefits solely based on societal stigma, as is often the case with marijuana, seems counterproductive.  \n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is difficult, as both substances have the potential for abuse. However, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, responsible marijuana use, when properly regulated, may offer therapeutic advantages.  \n\nI envision a gradual approach to marijuana legalization, starting with controlled medical use. This phased implementation would allow for careful monitoring and regulation, mitigating potential risks while allowing patients to access potential benefits. Removing the societal stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to fostering responsible use and encouraging open discussions about its potential applications.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However,  it's essential to recognize that it's not inherently as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting the narrative and promoting responsible use, we can unlock the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana while minimizing potential risks.",
            "The Church has definitely evolved to fit into the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest outfits – cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses.  \n\nIt was quite a routine, especially since I went to a private school where many of my friends also attended church. We'd often see each other there on weekends.  But things have changed. Now, they have a special mass geared towards teenagers, shortened to thirty minutes. People dress much more casually, especially during the summer. I've seen people arrive straight from the beach!  Families rush in late, and even the morning masses, which I used to dress up for, now see people in jeans and khakis.  \n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other aspects of the Church, I primarily observe these changes.  I don't have a deep understanding of the Church's internal politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't believe these issues could have been prevented simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and the attraction towards young children is a complex issue.\n\nI think becoming a priest is a personal choice, and some religions allow married clergy, like the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both faith and marriage, perhaps they could explore other denominations.\n\nMy perspective is that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. People aren't simply \"born\" that way, and it's not solely a result of upbringing.  While circumstances might play a role, genetics seem to be a significant factor, and marriage wouldn't necessarily eliminate that predisposition.\n\nIf the Church was aware of these issues and attempted to cover them up, that would be deeply wrong. However, I don't believe they were always aware of every instance.",
            "The initial concept held some appeal, but the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow.  It seemed as though the Iraq War was, in part, a response to those events. The Bush administration initially linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction - claims that have since been proven false. This deeply troubled me, and frankly, the Iraq War fills me with anger.\n\nThe Bush administration's handling of the situation deeply concerns me. I believe they misled the American people and have yet to acknowledge their actions. Even Colin Powell, who gave that prominent presentation at the UN, has stated that he wasn't fully convinced by the evidence even while delivering it. To me, this constitutes a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense.  I feel the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to diminish its importance, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards war.\n\nThere have been allegations, made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, that the younger Bush had personal motivations for targeting Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration.  It's also been suggested that securing access to energy resources was a contributing factor, a rather manipulative approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe duration of the conflict is unacceptable.  While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further loss of life, the current path forward seems problematic as well.  The proposed solution involves a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, intervening to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could ultimately create further complications.\n\nThe interim government appears to be crumbling, and the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable.  The Prime Minister seems to have limited influence over the political process.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we were actively combating not long ago, now hold significant power within the Iraqi Parliament.  The political landscape is fraught with tension due to these competing factions vying for control.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I acknowledge the initial impetus for the conflict, which stemmed from the tragic events of 9/11, I find myself questioning the continued justification for our involvement.  \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict.  Furthermore, the stated goals of promoting democracy and securing oil resources appear to be at odds with the reality on the ground. The protracted nature of the war has resulted in significant civilian casualties and instability, casting a shadow over our commitment to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe process of nation-building is inherently challenging, and attempting to impose Western democratic ideals upon a culture with deeply rooted traditions may ultimately prove counterproductive. The potential for resentment and resistance to our intervention is a serious concern.  \n\nMoreover, the ongoing conflict has fueled extremist ideologies and exacerbated sectarian tensions, creating a breeding ground for further violence.  While I understand the desire to protect American interests and support our troops, I believe that a sustained military presence in Iraq is not a sustainable solution. \n\nA more measured approach, focused on diplomacy, economic development, and supporting local initiatives for peace and reconciliation, may offer a more promising path forward.",
            "The question of legality regarding this particular issue is one that deeply concerns me. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is paramount. It explicitly delineates the boundaries between religious institutions and governmental authority, and I feel any attempt to encroach upon those boundaries would be a direct violation of this foundational principle.\n\nThose advocating for its criminalization seem to be prioritizing the beliefs of a specific religious group over others. While it's true that certain denominations, such as many Catholics and Christians, oppose it,  it's essential to recognize the diversity of viewpoints within these faiths.  Furthermore, it is not the government's role to dictate what religious organizations can or cannot deem permissible.\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom is a cornerstone of American society. It allows for a multiplicity of beliefs and practices to flourish. Introducing an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very principle, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on individual liberties. \n\nI firmly believe that the government should remain neutral on this matter.  The decision regarding its legality should rest with the respective religious communities, not with elected officials whose personal beliefs may not reflect the diverse perspectives within their constituencies. \n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment is unclear. It's difficult to predict whether it would have a positive or negative effect on society or the economy.  However, it's crucial to prioritize the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and avoid actions that could undermine religious freedom.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  From the outset, there were questions about the government's justification for the invasion.  While the attacks of September 11th understandably sparked a desire for retribution, the connection between those events and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best.  The administration's rhetoric seemed to blur the lines, capitalizing on the public's fear and anger to garner support for military action.\n\nPersonally, I'm deeply opposed to war, particularly preemptive strikes.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War.  A significant number of American soldiers have perished, a tragic consequence of a conflict that seemed to lack clear objectives and a well-defined exit strategy.  The US government's failure to anticipate the post-invasion chaos and the rise of insurgency highlights a lack of foresight and planning.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic government in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved to be a monumental challenge.  This parallels the difficulties faced during the Vietnam War, where the US attempted to impose its political system on a deeply divided nation. Both conflicts demonstrate the complexities of nation-building and the unintended consequences of intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq has dragged on for years, with significant costs in terms of both American lives and resources.  The training of Iraqi security forces remains a work in progress, and the future of the country remains uncertain. The initial claims about weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded, further fueling skepticism about the government's motives.\n\nThe question of whether the US should continue its involvement in Iraq remains a deeply contentious one.  While some argue for a complete withdrawal, others believe it is crucial to see the conflict through to its conclusion.  Ultimately, the decision involves weighing the human cost against the potential benefits of a stable and democratic Iraq.  It is a decision that demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and growing evidence suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis rather than being solely a sociological construct.  \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control seems fundamentally unjust.  I believe government should not interfere in these personal matters. Marriage is a private affair, a decision made between two people, not a matter for public or governmental intervention.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and raise families, just like any other couple. They contribute to our community and deserve the same recognition and legal protections as everyone else.  \n\nThe idea that political figures should dictate who can and cannot marry based on their interpretation of religious texts feels both antiquated and intrusive.  \n\nScientific research increasingly points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, suggesting it's not a choice but an inherent aspect of a person's identity.  This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current situation highlights a double standard. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without public scrutiny, while same-sex couples face intense media attention and societal judgment simply for seeking the same right. Marriage should be a private and personal matter, not a public spectacle.",
            "The nature of online platforms necessitates a careful consideration of the content we share. Once something is posted on the internet, it enters a public domain accessible to a vast audience. This accessibility carries significant implications, as online content can shape perceptions and influence opinions. \n\nAs someone who has worked in a residential advisor role, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online postings.  Expressing thoughts about harmful actions, even in jest, can be misconstrued and lead to serious repercussions. Schools, for example,  have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and may act upon information gleaned from online platforms if it raises concerns.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential for misuse of online information, it's equally crucial to recognize the importance of responsible disclosure.\n\nIndividuals should be mindful of the permanence of online content and consider the potential impact it may have on their reputation and relationships. Schools, while obligated to address potential threats, should navigate this delicate balance with sensitivity and respect for student privacy.",
            "The prolonged nature of the conflict deeply concerns me. While the initial aims, restoring democracy in a nation lacking fair governance, seemed noble, I believe we have strayed from that original purpose. The conflict now feels driven by an urge to assert global dominance, a pursuit of power rather than principle.\n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's initiation.  The historical tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein raise doubts about the purity of the original intentions.  If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a country lacking a just political system, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, it undermines the moral basis of the war.\n\nThe initial stages, the decisive military action, conveyed a powerful message. Yet, the conflict's continued escalation, stretching for years, seems excessive.  \n\nIf our goal was to liberate a nation under a tyrannical regime, then it was a worthy endeavor. However, I fear our rationale has become muddled and distorted over time. We appear to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than a just resolution.\n\nThe conflict has undoubtedly lingered long enough. It's time for the nation to take responsibility for its own future. We've been draining our economy, spending billions while neglecting domestic issues like poverty and inadequate infrastructure. These are pressing concerns that deserve our financial attention.\n\nBillions are being funneled into a prolonged war, diverting resources from crucial domestic needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.  These are areas that require immediate attention and investment.\n\nSpending taxpayer money on a conflict that has lost its original purpose is morally and financially irresponsible. It's time to end this war and redirect our resources towards addressing the critical challenges facing our own nation.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one. While it's true that information shared publicly on platforms like Myspace is accessible to anyone, the question arises about the boundaries of acceptable access.  \n\nFor instance, while a user might choose to make their profile visible to friends, it's unsettling to consider the potential for individuals to exploit this openness for malicious purposes. The scenario you described, where someone's online activity prevented a potentially dangerous situation, raises ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhile it's impractical to monitor every student's profile constantly, the possibility of targeted monitoring in specific circumstances, such as when there are credible threats, presents a difficult balance between security and individual privacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it disconcerting that personal information can be so readily accessible online.  I've encountered situations where strangers have contacted me through platforms like Facebook, possessing details about me that they shouldn't have.  \n\nThis highlights the vulnerability of online spaces and the need for caution. While these platforms offer valuable opportunities for communication and connection, it's crucial to be mindful of the information we share and the potential consequences.\n\nThe situation you mentioned regarding high schools banning Myspace is also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions have the authority to regulate students' online activities outside of school grounds.  This issue touches upon the evolving nature of privacy in the digital age and the challenges of navigating these complex boundaries.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift to the current realities and potential solutions.  \n\nA significant global consensus, reflected in polls conducted both within the United States, Iraq, and internationally, indicates a strong belief that the war was a misguided endeavor. This sentiment is shared by a majority of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who advocate for a swift withdrawal.  \n\nThe war's consequences have been undeniably devastating, both before and after our involvement. The intricate cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East pose significant challenges to effective engagement.  Imposing democratic ideals on a region with its own distinct cultural and historical context has proven to be a problematic approach.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential repercussions. The current situation necessitates a strategic and measured withdrawal. \n\nDespite the administration's potential arguments for continued presence, I believe a phased withdrawal over the course of a year or slightly longer would be a more responsible course of action.  \n\nUltimately, the Iraqi people themselves have a crucial stake in their future. If we were to consult them directly and they expressed a desire for our departure, it would be both ethically responsible and acknowledge their right to self-determination. While this may present challenges, it would ultimately be a more transparent and potentially more constructive approach.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it manifests in ways that extend beyond traditional gender roles. While women continue to face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to societal biases and the \"glass ceiling,\" men also encounter discrimination in certain fields. \n\nFor example, stay-at-home fathers often face societal pressure and judgment for not adhering to traditional masculine roles, despite their desire to prioritize family life. Similarly, men in the fashion industry sometimes struggle to be taken seriously due to prevailing stereotypes about masculinity and creative expression.\n\nThese examples illustrate that gender discrimination is not a monolithic issue but rather a complex web of societal perceptions and expectations that can disadvantage individuals based on their gender and chosen path. \n\nProgress has been made in challenging these biases, with women increasingly entering leadership positions and stay-at-home fathers gaining greater acceptance. However, change is gradual, and continued efforts are needed to dismantle deeply ingrained societal norms and promote equality for all.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex. While some advocate for full legalization, others, particularly in financially struggling communities, oppose it due to the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration. Decriminalization, on the other hand, shifts the focus from criminal penalties to civil citations, similar to traffic violations. \n\nThis approach reduces the severity of consequences while still acknowledging the potential for misuse.  Supporters of decriminalization argue that it frees up resources for municipalities to invest in vital public services like education, social programs, and homelessness assistance. They also contend that it addresses the societal stigma surrounding marijuana use, allowing for a more open and honest discussion about its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, opponents express concerns about the normalization of marijuana use and potential for increased accessibility, leading to public health and safety issues. They worry about the influence on youth, the potential for impaired driving, and the normalization of drug use in general.\n\nThe economic impact of marijuana legalization or decriminalization is a significant factor in the debate. Proponents highlight the potential for tax revenue and job creation, while opponents emphasize the costs associated with potential increases in healthcare expenses, addiction treatment, and social services.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana involves a careful consideration of various societal, economic, and ethical factors.",
            "While I recognize the value of tradition and the historical significance of the Catholic Church's practices, I believe there are aspects of their doctrine that need to be re-evaluated in light of modern values. \n\nOne area of concern is the rigidity surrounding religious observance. While I understand the importance of faith, I feel that a more inclusive approach to religious practice would be beneficial. For instance, the expectation that every Catholic attend mass weekly and adhere strictly to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion towards those who don't perfectly conform. \n\nThis lack of acceptance extends to individuals of other faiths.  My own parents experienced this firsthand when they were denied a Catholic marriage due to my father's Episcopalian background. This incident highlights a hypocrisy in the Church's teachings, as loving others is a core principle yet, in practice, acceptance of those outside the Catholic faith is limited.\n\nThe discrepancy between doctrine and practice is also evident in the ongoing debate surrounding priestly celibacy. While the Church maintains this requirement, many argue that allowing priests to marry could potentially address concerns about abuse of power.  \n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the issue of abuse is complex and multifaceted. While some might argue that permitting marriage could potentially mitigate certain risks, it is unlikely to be a complete solution.  The root causes of such abuse lie in deeper societal issues and individual pathology, and addressing them requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma for me.  I'm still grappling with the multifaceted implications, finding it difficult to definitively say whether one side is more right than the other.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage itself.  Drawing clear boundaries without causing offense to any group is a formidable task. \n\nMy personal inclination leans towards viewing marriage as a civil union, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious sacraments like baptism, it shouldn't dictate the specific form a marriage takes.  Civil unions, in my view, adequately recognize the commitment between two individuals.\n\nThe government should refrain from  scrutinizing the nature of a union, focusing instead on the fundamental fact that two people have chosen to join together.  If all states can reach a consensus on this matter, I believe they should advocate for federal legislation recognizing civil unions nationwide.\n\nHowever, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment aiming to ban same-sex marriage.  Altering the constitution for this purpose seems disproportionate to the issue. While it holds significant importance for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic measure.  The constitution should be amended only for matters of truly paramount national concern.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has given me a complex perspective on homosexuality. While I value the relationships of my many gay friends, I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to decide its own stance on marriage equality.  Given the diverse political landscapes across the nation, it's natural that states with differing viewpoints will approach this topic in distinct ways.  A state with a predominantly Democratic population might naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and residents of that state should respect the decisions made by their elected representatives.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to live according to their beliefs and values within the framework of their chosen community.  Therefore, I support the right of each state to determine its own marriage laws. I also believe that such a system avoids imposing a single viewpoint on the entire country, allowing for a more nuanced and localized approach to this complex issue.",
            "The concept of privacy online is complex, especially when it comes to student safety. While it's true that platforms like Myspace are intended for public sharing, the potential consequences of posts can be significant. School officials, in their role to ensure a safe learning environment, often have to navigate this delicate balance.\n\nIf information found online indicates a potential threat to student well-being, it's understandable why officials would want to investigate. This isn't about snooping; it's about taking proactive measures to prevent tragedies.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet leaves a permanent digital footprint. What seems like a harmless post today could have repercussions down the line. It's wise to exercise caution and consider the potential impact of our online actions.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with both individuals and institutions to create a safe and secure online space.  Schools must protect their students, and students must understand the implications of their online presence.",
            "The aftermath of September 11th had a profound impact on my views regarding the war. Initially, driven by a deeply personal connection to the tragedy, I strongly supported military intervention. I believed that a forceful response was necessary to punish those responsible and prevent further attacks. However, as time passed, I began to question the wisdom of our actions.\n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding the event, I realized, might have clouded our judgment. We seemed to act impulsively, lacking a comprehensive strategy or understanding of the long-term consequences. The lack of preparation was evident, and the conflict ultimately backfired, failing to achieve its intended objectives.\n\nMy perspective shifted significantly. Observing the ongoing conflict, I was struck by the internal divisions within the region. It became clear that external intervention might be counterproductive if the primary focus should be on fostering unity and stability within the country itself.\n\nThe complexities of war, particularly in that specific context, became more apparent. The cultural and societal differences led to misunderstandings and unintended consequences.  The motivations and goals of all parties involved were deeply intertwined, and the situation was far more nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nReflecting on the war's impact, I see it as a complex and multifaceted failure. While the initial intention might have been noble, the execution was flawed. The lack of a clear plan, the emotional underpinnings, and the cultural misunderstandings all contributed to a situation that continues to be fraught with challenges."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing challenges in maintaining its membership, and I believe its stance on certain social issues plays a role in this.  \n\nThe Church's traditionally conservative views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception may not resonate with a growing segment of society that holds more progressive beliefs. While the Church is entitled to its positions, these views can appear outdated to some, potentially leading to a disconnect with younger generations and those who find themselves at odds with these doctrines.\n\nIf the Church were to adopt a more contemporary perspective on these matters, it might be better positioned to connect with a wider audience and prevent further decline in its following.  \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable or marginalized within a religious institution that opposes these values.\n\nThe Church's stance on such issues can create a sense of exclusion for those who hold differing views, potentially driving them away from the faith.\n\nIt's worth considering if allowing married priests or ordaining women could address some of these concerns and foster a more inclusive environment.  \n\nWhile these measures might not have prevented past scandals, they could potentially create a more relatable and welcoming atmosphere for a broader range of individuals.",
            "I believe that individuals should have the freedom to marry whomever they choose, regardless of their sexual orientation. I don't think sexual orientation is a choice, and it's unfair to hold people accountable for something inherent to their identity. Denying same-sex couples the right to marry seems discriminatory, as it suggests that their relationships are somehow less valid than heterosexual relationships.\n\nWhile I've given this topic some thought, it's important to recognize that personal experiences shape our perspectives. I identify as straight, and while I can't fully grasp the complexities of being gay, I can empathize with the desire for equal rights and recognition. \n\nI also believe the federal government should not be involved in regulating personal matters like marriage. It's a deeply personal decision, and the government's role should be to protect individual liberties rather than dictate personal choices.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage is a matter of fundamental fairness and equality.  Arguments against it often stem from misconceptions and unfounded fears.  \n\nOne common concern is that allowing same-sex couples to marry will somehow undermine traditional family structures.  However, the nature of a loving, committed relationship transcends sexual orientation.  Just as a coin has two sides, both sides of the same fundamental value,  heterosexual and homosexual relationships share core elements – commitment, love, and partnership.\n\nBeyond the emotional aspect, there are significant legal and social implications.  Denying same-sex couples the right to marry has a profound impact on their access to essential rights and benefits.  For instance, in matters of healthcare, inheritance, and property ownership, legally recognized partners are afforded crucial protections that unmarried partners lack.  \n\nThe issue of religious objections is also frequently raised. While individuals are certainly entitled to their beliefs, government policies should not be based on specific religious doctrines.  Segregation based on sexual orientation is unjust and perpetuates inequality.  Marriage, in its legal sense, is a civil contract, not a religious sacrament.\n\nFurthermore, studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples experience similar levels of relationship satisfaction and stability as heterosexual couples.  Arguments suggesting that children raised by same-sex parents are somehow disadvantaged are not supported by evidence.\n\nThe federal government has a responsibility to ensure equal rights and protections for all its citizens.  Legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide would be a significant step towards achieving this goal, demonstrating that all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, are valued and respected members of society.",
            "Working as a pharmacy technician during the summer provided me with valuable insight into the complexities surrounding drug legality. I've observed firsthand that  a substance's legal status doesn't necessarily reflect its potential therapeutic benefits. \n\nWhile I believe making illicit drugs readily accessible to the public is unwise, I do advocate for their controlled use in medical settings.  Many medications, like oxycodone and Vicodin, are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse, yet they are essential tools for managing pain and other conditions.  Denying potential therapeutic benefits solely based on societal stigma, as is often the case with marijuana, seems counterproductive.  \n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is difficult, as both substances have the potential for abuse. However, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to serious health problems, responsible marijuana use, when properly regulated, may offer therapeutic advantages.  \n\nI envision a gradual approach to marijuana legalization, starting with controlled medical use. This phased implementation would allow for careful monitoring and regulation, mitigating potential risks while allowing patients to access potential benefits. Removing the societal stigma associated with marijuana is crucial to fostering responsible use and encouraging open discussions about its potential applications.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana stems largely from its illegal status. However,  it's essential to recognize that it's not inherently as harmful as substances like heroin or cocaine.  By shifting the narrative and promoting responsible use, we can unlock the potential therapeutic benefits of marijuana while minimizing potential risks.",
            "The Church has definitely evolved to fit into the 21st century. It's not as rigid as it once was.  Growing up, I attended church every Sunday, always dressed in my finest outfits – cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses.  \n\nIt was quite a routine, especially since I went to a private school where many of my friends also attended church. We'd often see each other there on weekends.  But things have changed. Now, they have a special mass geared towards teenagers, shortened to thirty minutes. People dress much more casually, especially during the summer. I've seen people arrive straight from the beach!  Families rush in late, and even the morning masses, which I used to dress up for, now see people in jeans and khakis.  \n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is the shift towards a more casual atmosphere.\n\nAs for other aspects of the Church, I primarily observe these changes.  I don't have a deep understanding of the Church's internal politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I don't believe these issues could have been prevented simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. There are married men who become pedophiles, and the attraction towards young children is a complex issue.\n\nI think becoming a priest is a personal choice, and some religions allow married clergy, like the minister in the TV show \"Seventh Heaven.\" If someone truly desires both faith and marriage, perhaps they could explore other denominations.\n\nMy perspective is that pedophilia is often rooted in genetics. People aren't simply \"born\" that way, and it's not solely a result of upbringing.  While circumstances might play a role, genetics seem to be a significant factor, and marriage wouldn't necessarily eliminate that predisposition.\n\nIf the Church was aware of these issues and attempted to cover them up, that would be deeply wrong. However, I don't believe they were always aware of every instance.",
            "The initial concept held some appeal, but the September 11th attacks cast a long shadow.  It seemed as though the Iraq War was, in part, a response to those events. The Bush administration initially linked the conflict to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, asserting that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction - claims that have since been proven false. This deeply troubled me, and frankly, the Iraq War fills me with anger.\n\nThe Bush administration's handling of the situation deeply concerns me. I believe they misled the American people and have yet to acknowledge their actions. Even Colin Powell, who gave that prominent presentation at the UN, has stated that he wasn't fully convinced by the evidence even while delivering it. To me, this constitutes a serious breach of trust and a potential impeachable offense.  I feel the Bush administration has shown a disregard for the Constitution, attempting to diminish its importance, particularly since September 11th.  It appears they entered office with a predisposition towards war.\n\nThere have been allegations, made by a former Secretary of the Treasury, that the younger Bush had personal motivations for targeting Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration.  It's also been suggested that securing access to energy resources was a contributing factor, a rather manipulative approach to foreign policy.\n\nThe duration of the conflict is unacceptable.  While a sudden withdrawal could lead to instability and civil war, resulting in further loss of life, the current path forward seems problematic as well.  The proposed solution involves a coalition of nations from the surrounding area, such as Syria and Saudi Arabia, intervening to restore order. However, this raises concerns about Iraq's sovereignty and could ultimately create further complications.\n\nThe interim government appears to be crumbling, and the Parliament's effectiveness is questionable.  The Prime Minister seems to have limited influence over the political process.  Even figures like Muqtada al-Sadr, whom we were actively combating not long ago, now hold significant power within the Iraqi Parliament.  The political landscape is fraught with tension due to these competing factions vying for control.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted issue. While I acknowledge the initial impetus for the conflict, which stemmed from the tragic events of 9/11, I find myself questioning the continued justification for our involvement.  \n\nThe lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress raises concerns about the legitimacy of the conflict.  Furthermore, the stated goals of promoting democracy and securing oil resources appear to be at odds with the reality on the ground. The protracted nature of the war has resulted in significant civilian casualties and instability, casting a shadow over our commitment to humanitarian principles.\n\nThe process of nation-building is inherently challenging, and attempting to impose Western democratic ideals upon a culture with deeply rooted traditions may ultimately prove counterproductive. The potential for resentment and resistance to our intervention is a serious concern.  \n\nMoreover, the ongoing conflict has fueled extremist ideologies and exacerbated sectarian tensions, creating a breeding ground for further violence.  While I understand the desire to protect American interests and support our troops, I believe that a sustained military presence in Iraq is not a sustainable solution. \n\nA more measured approach, focused on diplomacy, economic development, and supporting local initiatives for peace and reconciliation, may offer a more promising path forward.",
            "The question of legality regarding this particular issue is one that deeply concerns me. I believe the Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is paramount. It explicitly delineates the boundaries between religious institutions and governmental authority, and I feel any attempt to encroach upon those boundaries would be a direct violation of this foundational principle.\n\nThose advocating for its criminalization seem to be prioritizing the beliefs of a specific religious group over others. While it's true that certain denominations, such as many Catholics and Christians, oppose it,  it's essential to recognize the diversity of viewpoints within these faiths.  Furthermore, it is not the government's role to dictate what religious organizations can or cannot deem permissible.\n\nThe Constitution's guarantee of religious freedom is a cornerstone of American society. It allows for a multiplicity of beliefs and practices to flourish. Introducing an amendment to address this issue would contradict this very principle, potentially setting a dangerous precedent for future restrictions on individual liberties. \n\nI firmly believe that the government should remain neutral on this matter.  The decision regarding its legality should rest with the respective religious communities, not with elected officials whose personal beliefs may not reflect the diverse perspectives within their constituencies. \n\nThe potential impact of such an amendment is unclear. It's difficult to predict whether it would have a positive or negative effect on society or the economy.  However, it's crucial to prioritize the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution and avoid actions that could undermine religious freedom.",
            "The Iraq War has been a complex and controversial issue.  From the outset, there were questions about the government's justification for the invasion.  While the attacks of September 11th understandably sparked a desire for retribution, the connection between those events and the Iraqi government was tenuous at best.  The administration's rhetoric seemed to blur the lines, capitalizing on the public's fear and anger to garner support for military action.\n\nPersonally, I'm deeply opposed to war, particularly preemptive strikes.  The Iraq War, in many ways, echoes the mistakes of the Vietnam War.  A significant number of American soldiers have perished, a tragic consequence of a conflict that seemed to lack clear objectives and a well-defined exit strategy.  The US government's failure to anticipate the post-invasion chaos and the rise of insurgency highlights a lack of foresight and planning.\n\nAttempting to establish a democratic government in Iraq, while well-intentioned, proved to be a monumental challenge.  This parallels the difficulties faced during the Vietnam War, where the US attempted to impose its political system on a deeply divided nation. Both conflicts demonstrate the complexities of nation-building and the unintended consequences of intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq has dragged on for years, with significant costs in terms of both American lives and resources.  The training of Iraqi security forces remains a work in progress, and the future of the country remains uncertain. The initial claims about weapons of mass destruction proved to be unfounded, further fueling skepticism about the government's motives.\n\nThe question of whether the US should continue its involvement in Iraq remains a deeply contentious one.  While some argue for a complete withdrawal, others believe it is crucial to see the conflict through to its conclusion.  Ultimately, the decision involves weighing the human cost against the potential benefits of a stable and democratic Iraq.  It is a decision that demands careful consideration and a thorough understanding of the complexities involved.",
            "I strongly support marriage equality. It's a deeply personal choice, and growing evidence suggests that sexual orientation has a biological basis rather than being solely a sociological construct.  \n\nDenying individuals rights based on something beyond their control seems fundamentally unjust.  I believe government should not interfere in these personal matters. Marriage is a private affair, a decision made between two people, not a matter for public or governmental intervention.\n\nIn my own neighborhood, I know several openly gay couples who live together and raise families, just like any other couple. They contribute to our community and deserve the same recognition and legal protections as everyone else.  \n\nThe idea that political figures should dictate who can and cannot marry based on their interpretation of religious texts feels both antiquated and intrusive.  \n\nScientific research increasingly points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, suggesting it's not a choice but an inherent aspect of a person's identity.  This further strengthens the argument for equal rights.\n\nThe current situation highlights a double standard. Heterosexual couples can marry privately without public scrutiny, while same-sex couples face intense media attention and societal judgment simply for seeking the same right. Marriage should be a private and personal matter, not a public spectacle.",
            "The nature of online platforms necessitates a careful consideration of the content we share. Once something is posted on the internet, it enters a public domain accessible to a vast audience. This accessibility carries significant implications, as online content can shape perceptions and influence opinions. \n\nAs someone who has worked in a residential advisor role, I've encountered firsthand the consequences of online postings.  Expressing thoughts about harmful actions, even in jest, can be misconstrued and lead to serious repercussions. Schools, for example,  have a responsibility to ensure the safety of their students and may act upon information gleaned from online platforms if it raises concerns.\n\nWhile it's important to acknowledge the potential for misuse of online information, it's equally crucial to recognize the importance of responsible disclosure.\n\nIndividuals should be mindful of the permanence of online content and consider the potential impact it may have on their reputation and relationships. Schools, while obligated to address potential threats, should navigate this delicate balance with sensitivity and respect for student privacy.",
            "The prolonged nature of the conflict deeply concerns me. While the initial aims, restoring democracy in a nation lacking fair governance, seemed noble, I believe we have strayed from that original purpose. The conflict now feels driven by an urge to assert global dominance, a pursuit of power rather than principle.\n\nFurthermore, I question the motivations behind the war's initiation.  The historical tensions between former President Bush and Saddam Hussein raise doubts about the purity of the original intentions.  If the goal truly was to bring democracy to a country lacking a just political system, that would be a justifiable cause. However, if personal vendettas played a role, it undermines the moral basis of the war.\n\nThe initial stages, the decisive military action, conveyed a powerful message. Yet, the conflict's continued escalation, stretching for years, seems excessive.  \n\nIf our goal was to liberate a nation under a tyrannical regime, then it was a worthy endeavor. However, I fear our rationale has become muddled and distorted over time. We appear to be fighting for the sake of fighting, seeking a definitive victory rather than a just resolution.\n\nThe conflict has undoubtedly lingered long enough. It's time for the nation to take responsibility for its own future. We've been draining our economy, spending billions while neglecting domestic issues like poverty and inadequate infrastructure. These are pressing concerns that deserve our financial attention.\n\nBillions are being funneled into a prolonged war, diverting resources from crucial domestic needs like education, healthcare, and infrastructure development.  These are areas that require immediate attention and investment.\n\nSpending taxpayer money on a conflict that has lost its original purpose is morally and financially irresponsible. It's time to end this war and redirect our resources towards addressing the critical challenges facing our own nation.",
            "The question of privacy online is a complex one. While it's true that information shared publicly on platforms like Myspace is accessible to anyone, the question arises about the boundaries of acceptable access.  \n\nFor instance, while a user might choose to make their profile visible to friends, it's unsettling to consider the potential for individuals to exploit this openness for malicious purposes. The scenario you described, where someone's online activity prevented a potentially dangerous situation, raises ethical dilemmas. \n\nWhile it's impractical to monitor every student's profile constantly, the possibility of targeted monitoring in specific circumstances, such as when there are credible threats, presents a difficult balance between security and individual privacy.\n\nPersonally, I find it disconcerting that personal information can be so readily accessible online.  I've encountered situations where strangers have contacted me through platforms like Facebook, possessing details about me that they shouldn't have.  \n\nThis highlights the vulnerability of online spaces and the need for caution. While these platforms offer valuable opportunities for communication and connection, it's crucial to be mindful of the information we share and the potential consequences.\n\nThe situation you mentioned regarding high schools banning Myspace is also thought-provoking. It raises questions about the extent to which institutions have the authority to regulate students' online activities outside of school grounds.  This issue touches upon the evolving nature of privacy in the digital age and the challenges of navigating these complex boundaries.",
            "The Iraq War presents a complex and multifaceted dilemma. While I understand the sentiment of those who opposed the conflict from its inception, I believe the focus should shift to the current realities and potential solutions.  \n\nA significant global consensus, reflected in polls conducted both within the United States, Iraq, and internationally, indicates a strong belief that the war was a misguided endeavor. This sentiment is shared by a majority of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who advocate for a swift withdrawal.  \n\nThe war's consequences have been undeniably devastating, both before and after our involvement. The intricate cultural differences between the United States and the Middle East pose significant challenges to effective engagement.  Imposing democratic ideals on a region with its own distinct cultural and historical context has proven to be a problematic approach.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undeniably oppressive, the decision to invade Iraq should have been carefully weighed against the potential repercussions. The current situation necessitates a strategic and measured withdrawal. \n\nDespite the administration's potential arguments for continued presence, I believe a phased withdrawal over the course of a year or slightly longer would be a more responsible course of action.  \n\nUltimately, the Iraqi people themselves have a crucial stake in their future. If we were to consult them directly and they expressed a desire for our departure, it would be both ethically responsible and acknowledge their right to self-determination. While this may present challenges, it would ultimately be a more transparent and potentially more constructive approach.",
            "Gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States, though it manifests in ways that extend beyond traditional gender roles. While women continue to face challenges in reaching leadership positions due to societal biases and the \"glass ceiling,\" men also encounter discrimination in certain fields. \n\nFor example, stay-at-home fathers often face societal pressure and judgment for not adhering to traditional masculine roles, despite their desire to prioritize family life. Similarly, men in the fashion industry sometimes struggle to be taken seriously due to prevailing stereotypes about masculinity and creative expression.\n\nThese examples illustrate that gender discrimination is not a monolithic issue but rather a complex web of societal perceptions and expectations that can disadvantage individuals based on their gender and chosen path. \n\nProgress has been made in challenging these biases, with women increasingly entering leadership positions and stay-at-home fathers gaining greater acceptance. However, change is gradual, and continued efforts are needed to dismantle deeply ingrained societal norms and promote equality for all.",
            "The legalization debate surrounding marijuana is complex. While some advocate for full legalization, others, particularly in financially struggling communities, oppose it due to the costs associated with arrests, court proceedings, and incarceration. Decriminalization, on the other hand, shifts the focus from criminal penalties to civil citations, similar to traffic violations. \n\nThis approach reduces the severity of consequences while still acknowledging the potential for misuse.  Supporters of decriminalization argue that it frees up resources for municipalities to invest in vital public services like education, social programs, and homelessness assistance. They also contend that it addresses the societal stigma surrounding marijuana use, allowing for a more open and honest discussion about its potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\nHowever, opponents express concerns about the normalization of marijuana use and potential for increased accessibility, leading to public health and safety issues. They worry about the influence on youth, the potential for impaired driving, and the normalization of drug use in general.\n\nThe economic impact of marijuana legalization or decriminalization is a significant factor in the debate. Proponents highlight the potential for tax revenue and job creation, while opponents emphasize the costs associated with potential increases in healthcare expenses, addiction treatment, and social services.\n\nUltimately, the decision of whether to legalize or decriminalize marijuana involves a careful consideration of various societal, economic, and ethical factors.",
            "While I recognize the value of tradition and the historical significance of the Catholic Church's practices, I believe there are aspects of their doctrine that need to be re-evaluated in light of modern values. \n\nOne area of concern is the rigidity surrounding religious observance. While I understand the importance of faith, I feel that a more inclusive approach to religious practice would be beneficial. For instance, the expectation that every Catholic attend mass weekly and adhere strictly to doctrine can sometimes create a sense of judgment and exclusion towards those who don't perfectly conform. \n\nThis lack of acceptance extends to individuals of other faiths.  My own parents experienced this firsthand when they were denied a Catholic marriage due to my father's Episcopalian background. This incident highlights a hypocrisy in the Church's teachings, as loving others is a core principle yet, in practice, acceptance of those outside the Catholic faith is limited.\n\nThe discrepancy between doctrine and practice is also evident in the ongoing debate surrounding priestly celibacy. While the Church maintains this requirement, many argue that allowing priests to marry could potentially address concerns about abuse of power.  \n\nHowever, it's crucial to acknowledge that the issue of abuse is complex and multifaceted. While some might argue that permitting marriage could potentially mitigate certain risks, it is unlikely to be a complete solution.  The root causes of such abuse lie in deeper societal issues and individual pathology, and addressing them requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged approach.",
            "The issue of same-sex marriage presents a complex dilemma for me.  I'm still grappling with the multifaceted implications, finding it difficult to definitively say whether one side is more right than the other.  \n\nThe core challenge lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage itself.  Drawing clear boundaries without causing offense to any group is a formidable task. \n\nMy personal inclination leans towards viewing marriage as a civil union, regardless of the couple's sexual orientation.  Just as the government doesn't interfere with religious sacraments like baptism, it shouldn't dictate the specific form a marriage takes.  Civil unions, in my view, adequately recognize the commitment between two individuals.\n\nThe government should refrain from  scrutinizing the nature of a union, focusing instead on the fundamental fact that two people have chosen to join together.  If all states can reach a consensus on this matter, I believe they should advocate for federal legislation recognizing civil unions nationwide.\n\nHowever, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment aiming to ban same-sex marriage.  Altering the constitution for this purpose seems disproportionate to the issue. While it holds significant importance for some, it doesn't warrant such a drastic measure.  The constitution should be amended only for matters of truly paramount national concern.",
            "My upbringing in a Christian household has given me a complex perspective on homosexuality. While I value the relationships of my many gay friends, I personally don't subscribe to that lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the principle of individual liberty and support the legalization of same-sex marriage. \n\nI advocate for a decentralized approach to this issue, where each state has the autonomy to decide its own stance on marriage equality.  Given the diverse political landscapes across the nation, it's natural that states with differing viewpoints will approach this topic in distinct ways.  A state with a predominantly Democratic population might naturally lean towards legalizing gay marriage, and residents of that state should respect the decisions made by their elected representatives.  \n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the freedom to live according to their beliefs and values within the framework of their chosen community.  Therefore, I support the right of each state to determine its own marriage laws. I also believe that such a system avoids imposing a single viewpoint on the entire country, allowing for a more nuanced and localized approach to this complex issue.",
            "The concept of privacy online is complex, especially when it comes to student safety. While it's true that platforms like Myspace are intended for public sharing, the potential consequences of posts can be significant. School officials, in their role to ensure a safe learning environment, often have to navigate this delicate balance.\n\nIf information found online indicates a potential threat to student well-being, it's understandable why officials would want to investigate. This isn't about snooping; it's about taking proactive measures to prevent tragedies.\n\nIt's important to remember that the internet leaves a permanent digital footprint. What seems like a harmless post today could have repercussions down the line. It's wise to exercise caution and consider the potential impact of our online actions.\n\nUltimately, the responsibility lies with both individuals and institutions to create a safe and secure online space.  Schools must protect their students, and students must understand the implications of their online presence.",
            "The aftermath of September 11th had a profound impact on my views regarding the war. Initially, driven by a deeply personal connection to the tragedy, I strongly supported military intervention. I believed that a forceful response was necessary to punish those responsible and prevent further attacks. However, as time passed, I began to question the wisdom of our actions.\n\nThe emotional intensity surrounding the event, I realized, might have clouded our judgment. We seemed to act impulsively, lacking a comprehensive strategy or understanding of the long-term consequences. The lack of preparation was evident, and the conflict ultimately backfired, failing to achieve its intended objectives.\n\nMy perspective shifted significantly. Observing the ongoing conflict, I was struck by the internal divisions within the region. It became clear that external intervention might be counterproductive if the primary focus should be on fostering unity and stability within the country itself.\n\nThe complexities of war, particularly in that specific context, became more apparent. The cultural and societal differences led to misunderstandings and unintended consequences.  The motivations and goals of all parties involved were deeply intertwined, and the situation was far more nuanced than initially perceived.\n\nReflecting on the war's impact, I see it as a complex and multifaceted failure. While the initial intention might have been noble, the execution was flawed. The lack of a clear plan, the emotional underpinnings, and the cultural misunderstandings all contributed to a situation that continues to be fraught with challenges."
