            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its following, and one of the possible reasons for this trend may be its stance on certain issues. The Church's views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have been a point of contention for some people. These issues might be seen as outdated and not in line with the evolving values of society.\n\nThe Church's strict views on these matters may be alienating individuals who hold different opinions. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable joining a community that considers these practices morally wrong. Similarly, individuals who believe in the importance of marriage equality or reproductive freedom may feel that the Church's stance on these issues is too restrictive.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to ordain women as priests and its requirement that priests remain celibate may be seen as limiting and outdated. While the Church views its priests as being devoted to God, it is hard to understand why they cannot have a family life like other professionals. It is reasonable to assume that having a spouse and children might not necessarily lead to a change in their work, just as it does not for many people in other careers.\n\nThe Church's adamant stance on certain issues might be driving away individuals who are looking for a more inclusive and accepting community. As a result, it is essential for the Church to re-evaluate its views and adapt to the changing values of society. By doing so, it may be possible to prevent further decline in its following and attract individuals who share its values but also expect a more nuanced approach to complex issues.",
            "The topic of same-sex marriage has garnered significant attention in recent years, with varying opinions on whether it should be recognized by law. From my perspective, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems that one's sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity.\n\nWhile I may not have extensively explored this topic, my stance is clear: I do not agree that the government should dictate who can and cannot get married based on their sexual orientation. I believe that this decision should be left to the individuals involved and those who care about them.\n\nThere is a misconception that people are born straight or gay, but the reality is that it's a complex issue that cannot be reduced to simple labels. However, I do believe that individuals should not be judged or penalized for who they are. The government's role in regulating marriage is not only unnecessary but also intrusive.\n\nIn my opinion, the government's involvement in same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security or moral values, but rather a personal matter that should be left to the individuals involved. It's essential to respect people's autonomy and allow them to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the federal government should not be involved in deciding who can get married and who cannot. This decision should be made by the individuals and those who care about them, not by the government. By doing so, we can promote a more accepting and inclusive society where everyone can live freely and authentically.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue for quite some time. However, as I've researched and considered the topic, I firmly believe that it's time for the federal government to reevaluate its stance on this matter. The primary reason for this is that there are numerous studies that demonstrate the similarities between same-sex relationships and traditional marriages. These studies indicate that both have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction, such as commitment, trust, and communication.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments against same-sex marriage is the notion that it poses a threat to the traditional family unit. However, this argument is based on a misconception that same-sex couples are fundamentally different from heterosexual couples. In reality, the dynamics of same-sex relationships are not significantly different from those of opposite-sex relationships. Both involve individuals forming emotional bonds, making long-term commitments, and contributing to their partner's well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that same-sex couples are seeking to marry in a church is a misconception. They are, in fact, seeking a legal recognition of their relationship in the form of a marriage certificate, a document issued by the government. By separating church and state, we can resolve the issue of religious disagreement and focus on the legal implications of marriage.\n\nThe concept of \"separate but equal\" is often used to describe the current system of civil unions, but this is a flawed analogy. In reality, same-sex couples are not being treated equally, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. This is evident in the areas of property taxes, healthcare, and adoption.\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding same-sex marriage is the impact on children. However, research suggests that children raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to experience difficulties than those raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, children of same-sex parents often face unique challenges, such as bullying and social stigma, which can be mitigated by providing support and education to the community.\n\nThe federal government should play a more active role in addressing these issues and promoting equality for all citizens. By making same-sex marriage legal in every state, we can ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The idea that morality is negotiable is a complex issue, and it's essential to consider the diverse perspectives and values of our society. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge the impact of misinformation and prejudice on public opinion. Many people base their opinions on misconceptions and stereotypes rather than evidence-based research. By promoting education and awareness, we can work towards a more informed and empathetic society.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be based on the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of all individuals, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society.",
            "When evaluating the availability of medicinal substances, it's crucial to separate the issue from societal stigmas. Working in a hospital pharmacy during the summer has given me a unique perspective on this matter. While certain substances may be prohibited due to their potential for abuse, their therapeutic benefits should not be dismissed outright.\n\nFor instance, many controlled substances that are illegal in their unregulated form are still used in pharmacies to treat a range of conditions. Medications like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples of controlled substances with proven medical value. Their benefits cannot be ignored solely because of their illicit status.\n\nSimilarly, marijuana possesses medicinal properties that warrant consideration. The fact that it is often associated with negative connotations should not overshadow its potential benefits. If we can differentiate between the substance itself and its potential for abuse, we can begin to reevaluate its role in healthcare.\n\nTo address concerns about responsible use, a gradual approach to legalization could be more effective than a sudden change. By removing the stigma surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more informed and responsible attitude towards its use.\n\nThe misconception surrounding marijuana stems from its reputation as an illicit substance. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively moderate. By reframing our understanding of marijuana, we may be able to promote more responsible use and its integration into medical practices.\n\nUltimately, a nuanced approach to substance regulation can help us make more informed decisions about the role of marijuana in healthcare.",
            "While reflecting on the evolution of my childhood church, I've observed a noticeable shift towards a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms; instead, the church has adapted to the 21st century's changing values. Sundays now observe a more casual dress code, with attendees often sporting jeans and casual wear, especially during the summer months. This shift is particularly evident in the condensed 30-minute masses, which cater to the busy lives of young families.\n\nAs I reminisce about my own experiences at a private school, I recall the weekly ritual of attending church with my friends. We'd dress up in our Sunday best, complete with matching outfits and accessories. However, even back then, the church was evolving, and this gradual change has continued over the years.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one. While some argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I disagree. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that transcends societal norms and religious affiliations. Statistics show that married individuals can still struggle with these impulses, and it's ultimately a matter of personal choice rather than a symptom of their marital status.\n\nIn fact, some denominations that allow their clergy to marry, such as certain Protestant churches, still struggle with these issues. It's essential to recognize that pedophilia is often a product of genetic predisposition and not a result of upbringing or environment. While genetic factors may play a significant role, it's also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with these tendencies often try to conceal them, even through marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church's adaptation to modern times is noteworthy, I don't believe that changes in their policies would have prevented the recent scandals. It's essential to address the root causes of these issues and hold those responsible accountable, rather than placing blame on the institution itself.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially had reservations about the premise, which I believe was largely overshadowed by the lingering sentiments following the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration used the threat of Iraq as a pretext for invasion, fueled by claims linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, which have since been discredited. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me, as it suggests a blatant disregard for the truth and a willingness to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe Bush administration's propensity for deception has been a recurring theme throughout their tenure, with even high-ranking officials like Colin Powell later expressing doubts about the evidence they presented at the time. This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The notion that they have consistently disregarded constitutional principles, particularly in the post-9/11 era, is troubling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were likely multifaceted, with some speculating that the younger Bush sought to expand the country's energy resources, a goal that was allegedly influenced by his father's administration. This underhanded approach to governance is concerning, particularly given the devastating consequences of the war.\n\nWhile I believe the conflict has dragged on for far too long, a hasty withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, potentially resulting in civil war and increased casualties. The proposed solution, involving a coalition of regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be the most effective approach, as it could further erode Iraq's sovereignty and create new challenges for the country's fragile government. The Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the influence of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nUltimately, the complex situation in Iraq has left me searching for a clear and effective solution, but one that balances the need for stability with the importance of respecting the country's sovereignty and promoting accountability within the political process.",
            "When considering the complexities of the Iraq War, my thoughts are multifaceted and influenced by various factors. It's essential to acknowledge that the conflict was not officially declared by Congress, which raises questions about its legitimacy. At the same time, it's crucial to remember that the initial motivations behind the war were in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were perpetrated by terrorists believed to have ties to Iraq.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that the war has become a protracted and complex issue, with multiple factors at play. The primary goal of establishing democracy in Iraq has been a driving force behind our continued presence, but it's also clear that this process is a long-term endeavor that cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, the war has resulted in significant human suffering and loss, including the displacement of families and the disruption of communities.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the cultural divide between our societies. While it's essential to acknowledge the right to self-determination, our attempts to impose our values and system on Iraq may ultimately exacerbate the problem. This could lead to a deepening hatred towards the United States and the proliferation of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has become a quagmire that will continue to plague us for years to come. It's essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to reevaluate our goals and strategies. While it's difficult to provide a clear solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complexities of the conflict and the cultural and historical context of Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the war in Iraq presents a complex web of issues that require thoughtful consideration and a multifaceted approach. It's essential to engage in a national dialogue that takes into account the various perspectives and interests at play, with the goal of finding a path forward that promotes peace, stability, and the well-being of the Iraqi people.",
            "The concept of government intervention in matters of religious freedom has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The First Amendment, with its explicit mention of the separation of church and state, serves as a cornerstone for the nation's commitment to religious tolerance. However, there are those who advocate for government involvement in regulating the practices of various faiths.\n\nIn my opinion, such an approach is misguided and contravenes the principles enshrined in the Constitution. By attempting to impose its will on matters of faith, the government would be overstepping its authority and infringing upon the rights of religious institutions. The Constitution's Founding Fathers deliberately established a framework that ensures the separation of church and state, allowing for the free exercise of religion without interference from the government.\n\nMoreover, the notion that the government should dictate what is permissible in a particular faith is a slippery slope. It would inevitably lead to favoritism, where the government would be choosing one denomination over another, potentially stifling the diversity of religious expression that is so essential to American society. The example of Catholic and Christian opposition to this particular issue in certain regions highlights the potential for favoritism and the danger of government overreach.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for the coexistence of various faiths in harmony. Any attempt to undermine this fundamental aspect of the Constitution would be a step backward, potentially restricting the rights of individuals and institutions rather than protecting them. In light of this, I believe it is essential to maintain the status quo and allow religious institutions to govern themselves, free from government interference.\n\nThe motivation behind government intervention in this matter appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good. The potential consequences of such an amendment would be far-reaching, and it is uncertain how it would impact the economy or society as a whole. It is crucial to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal opinions to dictate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should refrain from intervening in matters of faith, allowing religious institutions to operate freely and autonomously. The Constitution's founders wisely established a framework that prioritizes individual freedom and diversity, and it is our duty to uphold these principles and preserve the integrity of our democracy.",
            "The Iraq War has left a lasting impact on the world, and I believe the US government's motives for invading Iraq were not entirely transparent. Many people felt that the administration used the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This raised questions about the government's honesty with the American people. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to preemptive war, and I believe that the invasion of Iraq followed a pattern similar to the Vietnam War. Both conflicts involved an attempt to impose democracy on a foreign nation, which often results in a complex and challenging process. The removal of a country's government can lead to chaos and instability, and I think the US government underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding a new government in Iraq.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been significant, with many American lives lost. I believe that the administration failed to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, including the power vacuum that would be left by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. This lack of planning has led to ongoing instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe idea of spreading democracy is admirable, but it's a difficult and time-consuming process. Implementing a new form of government requires patience, understanding, and a deep knowledge of the local culture. In our own country, democracy was not established overnight, and it took many years of struggle and conflict to achieve.\n\nThe war in Iraq has also raised questions about the role of the US in global politics. I think the government's actions were motivated by a desire to control resources, particularly oil. The lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to accusations that the administration was not truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue, and the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences. I hope that the conflict will eventually come to an end and that a lasting peace will be established in the region. However, I fear that this may not be the case.",
            "My stance on gay marriage has been consistent - I firmly support the right to same-sex unions. I believe this is a matter of personal preference, and recent scientific discoveries have shown that sexuality can be influenced by biological factors rather than solely by societal influences. It's hard to justify denying individuals their rights due to something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's essential to separate politics and government from personal choices, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Marriage is a deeply personal commitment that should not be subject to external regulations. In fact, seeing same-sex couples in my neighborhood, who live and interact like any other family, has only strengthened my conviction.\n\nThe notion that politicians, like the previous administration, try to impose their interpretation of marriage on the public is not only misguided but also an overreach of power. I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a topic for public debate or scrutiny.\n\nResearch has shown that genetic and biological factors can contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. For instance, studies suggest that some people may be predisposed to be homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or environment. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting and respecting people's choices, rather than trying to justify discrimination.\n\nIn my opinion, the distinction between gay and heterosexual couples seeking marriage should not be a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so privately, without drawing attention to themselves. Conversely, if a same-sex couple wants to formalize their relationship, it's not right that it becomes a media sensation. This highlights the need to treat all relationships with equal respect and avoid making them the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "The internet has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of communication: its inherent public nature. As we've seen firsthand in our community, postings made online can have far-reaching consequences. As a Residential Advisor, I've had to navigate this issue personally, and it's a valuable lesson I've learned.\n\nWhen individuals share information online, they must consider the potential impact on their reputation. Sharing sensitive or inflammatory content can lead to misinterpretation and garner unwanted attention. This is particularly concerning when discussing topics like violence or threats, which can be misinterpreted or taken out of context. In such cases, school authorities often feel compelled to act, as they have a responsibility to ensure student safety.\n\nThe proliferation of social media has made it increasingly difficult to discern what's genuine and what's not. It's not uncommon for people to post humorous or thought-provoking content that's later misinterpreted or taken seriously. In one instance, a situation arose on our campus when a student's online posting was misinterpreted, leading to a thorough investigation. The individual in question had posted content that, in hindsight, may have been intended as a joke, but it sparked concern and warranted a closer look.\n\nThe internet's lack of inherent privacy is a critical aspect of online interactions. If an individual chooses to share information online, they should be prepared for it to be accessed by others. This includes school officials, who may be alerted to concerning content by students or parents. While it's essential to respect students' online autonomy, school authorities have a responsibility to act when they become aware of potential threats or dangers.\n\nIn terms of monitoring online activity, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between respecting students' online lives and protecting their safety. While I don't think school officials should engage in extensive surveillance, I do believe that they have a right to address concerns brought to their attention. This can be done by working with the individual or their parents to address the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for individuals to be mindful of their online presence and the potential consequences of their actions. As a Residential Advisor, I strive to educate my residents about the importance of responsible online behavior and the potential impact of their online actions on their reputation and well-being.",
            "The war has been prolonged for an unnecessarily extensive period, raising concerns about its original objectives. Initially, the intention to establish democracy in another country seemed justifiable, particularly considering the absence of a fair political system. However, it appears that the purpose has become increasingly distorted over time.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder if the war was instigated by personal grievances of the past, such as the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the primary goal was to introduce democracy, it would have been a commendable endeavor, but the presence of personal agendas would have tainted the mission.\n\nIt seems that the initial momentum was sufficient to convey a strong message, particularly in the early stages of the conflict. Nevertheless, the war has persisted for an inordinate amount of time, with the continuation of hostilities becoming increasingly questionable.\n\nIf the primary objective was to topple a tyrannical regime and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble pursuit. However, it appears that the motivations have become muddled over time, and the war has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe war has been waged for an excessive duration, and it is high time for a conclusion. The government of the invaded country must eventually be self-sufficient, and it is likely that this point has already been reached. The financial burden of the war is substantial, with billions of dollars being diverted from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare.\n\nThe allocation of funds to a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose is a concern, particularly when domestic problems are left unaddressed. The money spent on the war could be better utilized to address pressing issues within the country, such as education, healthcare, and public services.",
            "The question of whether schools should monitor students' online activities is a complex issue. While some may argue that privacy is compromised when individuals share personal information online, it's essential to consider the context in which this information is shared.\n\nWhen users post content on social media platforms like Myspace, they are, in effect, granting permission to a select group of individuals to view their profiles. This can include friends, classmates, and even acquaintances. While this may seem like an invasion of privacy on the surface, it's essential to recognize that individuals have some control over who can view their content.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether monitoring students' online activities is a viable solution to prevent potential threats. While it's unrealistic to expect a single individual to constantly monitor every student's profile, it's also difficult to justify discriminating against certain groups of students based on their online behavior.\n\nUltimately, the line between monitoring and surveillance is blurred. While some may argue that monitoring is necessary to prevent potential harm, others believe that it's an invasion of students' rights. The scenario where someone uses online information to prevent a life from being lost raises important questions about the role of social media in ensuring student safety.\n\nPersonally, having a social media presence can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, it allows individuals to connect with friends and maintain relationships. On the other hand, it can also expose users to potential risks, such as online harassment or stalking. As someone who uses Facebook, I'm aware of the importance of being cautious when sharing personal information online.\n\nA recent incident I saw on TV highlighted the ease with which individuals can gather information about others online. This raised concerns about the potential consequences of sharing personal details, such as screen names and class schedules, on social media. However, I also recognize the value of social media in maintaining relationships and staying connected with friends.\n\nThe issue of social media monitoring in schools is another area of concern. In some cases, schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, sparking questions about the extent of their authority to regulate students' online activities. While this may be seen as a way to ensure student safety, it's also essential to consider the implications for students' freedom of expression and online freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of social media monitoring is a nuanced one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. As we navigate the complexities of online interactions, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of our actions and the importance of balancing individual rights with the need for student safety.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and I must admit that discussing it makes me feel uncomfortable. Reflecting on my own stance, I realize that I initially opposed the invasion, aligning with the prevailing public opinion at the time. However, the ongoing debate has led me to question the war's validity. A significant majority of global citizens, including Iraqis and U.S. troops stationed in the region, share my initial concerns. According to various polls, roughly 75-80% of the international community believes the invasion was a misguided decision.\n\nThe complexities of the situation are evident when considering the cultural and historical context of the Middle East. The significant cultural disparities between the U.S. and the region create a challenging environment for implementing democracy. It's essential to acknowledge that the people of Iraq would have chosen a different approach to governance, rather than one imposed by an external force.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a problematic leader, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons before embarking on a costly and potentially disastrous intervention. The consequences of the invasion have been severe, and the ongoing occupation has created a seemingly intractable situation.\n\nI'm not convinced by the administration's arguments for continued involvement. While they may have valid concerns about the potential consequences of a hasty withdrawal, I'm yet to be persuaded by their reasoning. A gradual exit strategy over the course of a year or more might be a more viable option. However, I struggle to see a compelling argument for prolonging the occupation.\n\nA striking statistic I encountered highlights the sentiment of the Iraqi people: a significant majority believes that the U.S. should leave within the year, with some even advocating for an immediate withdrawal. As we claim to be intervening to help the Iraqi people, it's worth considering their perspective and potential solutions that prioritize their needs and desires.\n\nUltimately, even if we were to withdraw, we could still maintain a relationship with the Iraqi people and attempt to rectify any harm caused. This approach would at least ensure that we're not exacerbating the situation and could potentially be seen as a more humanitarian gesture. However, it's essential to acknowledge that our actions in the Middle East have not been without controversy, and it's uncertain whether we can ever fully be viewed as benevolent actors in the region.",
            "While it's undeniable that progress has been made in reducing inequality, I firmly believe that the United States still grapples with significant gender biases. It's essential to acknowledge that these prejudices can manifest differently depending on the specific industry and societal context.\n\nIn the professional sphere, the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where women face difficulties in advancing to leadership positions, persists. Despite having the necessary qualifications, women often encounter resistance to their promotion due to deeply ingrained societal expectations. This bias is not limited to women; men in traditionally masculine fields like business and industry may also face challenges. For instance, a male staying at home with children may be met with skepticism, as societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\n\nSimilarly, in the fashion industry, there's a tendency to dismiss men who are passionate about fashion, assuming that their interests are not truly authentic. This attitude can be attributed to a narrow understanding of masculinity and the expectation that men should conform to traditional norms.\n\nEfforts to combat these biases are hindered by the deeply ingrained nature of these attitudes. However, there are signs of progress, such as women rising to leadership positions and increasing acceptance of stay-at-home dads. To accelerate change, it's crucial to promote the qualities and achievements of individuals who defy traditional stereotypes, rather than forcing them upon others. A delicate balance must be struck between pushing for progress and avoiding resistance.\n\nInterestingly, biases can also manifest across different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations. For instance, an individual from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those with more refined communication skills, despite being highly intelligent and capable. This highlights the complexity of the issue, which extends beyond gender to include factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to recognize that overcoming these biases will require a sustained effort and a nuanced understanding of the various factors at play.",
            "My understanding is that the substance in question has undergone a significant transformation in the legal sphere. While it was previously considered a criminal offense, it has been decriminalized, essentially relegating it to a fine-able infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change eliminates the need for arrests, court appearances, and the associated costs that come with them. However, the ramifications of being caught with the substance still persist, particularly in terms of job prospects and social implications.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of decriminalization is the financial aspect. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for the substance is costly, and the resources allocated to this endeavor could be redirected towards more pressing community needs. Municipalities grappling with financial constraints may be hesitant to adopt such a policy, even if it would yield significant financial benefits.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, has taken a more progressive stance, and the city has reportedly seen a substantial increase in available funds for public education, social programs, and other community initiatives. While it's essential to consider the potential consequences of widespread use, the financial benefits of decriminalization cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the substance's potential impact on society is multifaceted. While some may view it as a relatively benign substance, others may be uncomfortable with its presence in public spaces. The fear of impaired driving and the ongoing stigma surrounding the substance's use are valid concerns.\n\nThe effects of the substance vary greatly from person to person, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about its impact. Some individuals may be able to moderate their use, while others may struggle with its consequences. Both the substance in question and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with nuance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize the substance is a complex one, influenced by a range of factors, including personal attitudes, societal norms, and financial considerations.",
            "While I agree with many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that adaptability to change is essential. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, but it's equally important to ensure that these customs don't hinder its ability to grow and evolve. \n\nOne area where the Catholic Church's strict adherence to doctrine and tradition can be problematic is in its stance on interfaith relationships. For instance, my parents, one a practicing Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This experience made me realize that the Church's exclusivity can sometimes lead to a lack of tolerance for those who don't conform to its teachings.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between Catholic doctrine and practice is another area of concern. The Church's emphasis on love and acceptance is contradicted by its refusal to accept those who don't meet its standards. This paradox can be jarring, especially when considering the long history of the Church.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that marriage could help prevent instances of misconduct, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that often involves a pattern of behavior rather than a specific circumstance. Therefore, I'm not sure that allowing priests to marry would be a deterrent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's traditional approach can be both a strength and a weakness. While its commitment to its teachings is admirable, it's essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of its strict adherence to doctrine and tradition. By acknowledging these complexities, the Church can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach.",
            "The issue at hand presents a complex challenge, as it navigates the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. This dichotomy is particularly tricky to resolve without alienating certain groups. Ultimately, my stance on the matter remains unclear, as I find it difficult to definitively assert the legitimacy of either perspective.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the distinction between marriage and civil unions is a crucial point of contention. The fact that civil unions confer similar benefits to those of marriage, such as tax advantages, suggests that the government should not dictate the legitimacy of a union based on its religious connotations. In essence, a civil union merely represents a legally recognized partnership between two individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nIf we were to view marriage solely as a civil institution, we could avoid conflating church and state. This would also enable the government to focus on the practical aspects of marriage, such as the union of two individuals, rather than its spiritual or religious undertones. Consequently, the legalization of gay marriage would not be a contentious issue, as it would be recognized as a civil union, akin to any other.\n\nIf a consensus is reached among the states, it would be reasonable to push for federal legislation to codify this understanding. However, I strongly believe that banning gay marriage by way of a constitutional amendment is an extreme measure. The Constitution should not be amended to address a matter of such limited significance, particularly when it would disproportionately affect a minority group.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of gay marriage should not be elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment. It is not a matter of sufficient magnitude to warrant such a drastic measure, and it is essential to maintain a separation between church and state to ensure that the government does not impose its values on its citizens.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have often grappled with the complexities of the LGBTQ+ community. While my upbringing has informed my views, it has also led me to appreciate the diversity of perspectives within this issue. My friends who identify as gay have shown me the importance of understanding and empathy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their personal lives, free from undue influence from the federal government. I think that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach acknowledges the differences in cultural values and societal norms that exist between various regions.\n\nI recognize that some states, particularly those with a predominantly democratic lean, may be more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights. However, I also believe that individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local values and decisions that come with that choice.\n\nWhile the current federal ban on gay marriage has been a topic of controversy, I think it's essential to consider the implications of a federal decision on the lives of individuals. In my opinion, the president's role should be to ensure that each state has the freedom to make its own decisions, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe changing landscape of U.S. politics, including the upcoming presidential election, underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. Rather than relying on a federal mandate, I believe that states should have the authority to decide what works best for their communities. This approach would allow for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that each state should have the autonomy to make its own decisions regarding same-sex marriage, rather than deferring to the federal government. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "When considering the implications of school officials monitoring student online activity, it's essential to acknowledge that social media platforms like Myspace are, by definition, public spaces. As such, any information posted on these platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. In the context of preventing potential harm, such as school shootings, it's reasonable to assume that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety.\n\nIn this light, if school officials discover content on Myspace that indicates students are engaging in illicit behavior, it's not an invasion of privacy if they take action to address the issue. In fact, it's a necessary step in maintaining a secure learning environment. This approach is analogous to the measures taken in schools to prepare for potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness.\n\nFor instance, my own high school experience involved regular lockdown drills and safety protocols, which were implemented in response to national security concerns, including the possibility of terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to school shootings, the underlying principle is the same: to create a safe and secure environment for students.\n\nIn the specific case of school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and create a safer school environment. While some might view this as an invasion of privacy, it's essential to weigh this against the potential consequences of inaction. By taking proactive steps to address potential threats, school officials can help prevent incidents like the Columbine shooting.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring student online activity is complex and multifaceted. However, when considering the potential consequences of inaction, it's clear that proactive measures to ensure student safety are justified.",
            "The events following the catastrophic events of 9/11 had a profound impact on America's foreign policy. Initially, I was in favor of taking a proactive approach to address the threat posed by terrorism. However, as time passed, I began to question the strategic decisions made by our government. It is my opinion that the war in Iraq was fought without a clear plan or a thorough understanding of the consequences. The emotional response to 9/11 led to a hasty decision-making process that prioritized immediate action over long-term strategy.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the local culture. Our military intervention was met with resistance, and the conflict escalated. The war in Iraq has been a protracted and costly endeavor that has yielded limited progress. I now question the effectiveness of our presence in the region.\n\nOne of the primary concerns I have is that our efforts have not led to lasting stability in Iraq. The ongoing conflict between various factions has hindered our ability to make a meaningful impact. I firmly believe that as long as these groups are engaged in internal power struggles, they will be unable to focus on external threats, including those posed by the United States. In my opinion, our continued involvement in the conflict is not a viable solution.\n\nMoreover, I think it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of war differs significantly between Western and Middle Eastern cultures. The aftermath of war in Iraq has been marked by chaos, and I fear that our military presence has only exacerbated the situation. It appears to me that the primary objective of our involvement was to remove Saddam Hussein from power, rather than to establish a stable and self-sufficient government.\n\nA more considered approach might have yielded better results. A more nuanced understanding of the local dynamics and a clear plan for our objectives could have led to a more effective and sustainable resolution. In my opinion, the war in Iraq was a product of a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy.\n\nLooking back, I believe that our involvement in Iraq has been a costly and misguided endeavor. We should have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing diplomacy and international cooperation over military intervention. In the end, I think our continued presence in the region is not a solution, but rather a cause of further instability."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its following, and one of the possible reasons for this trend may be its stance on certain issues. The Church's views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have been a point of contention for some people. These issues might be seen as outdated and not in line with the evolving values of society.\n\nThe Church's strict views on these matters may be alienating individuals who hold different opinions. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable joining a community that considers these practices morally wrong. Similarly, individuals who believe in the importance of marriage equality or reproductive freedom may feel that the Church's stance on these issues is too restrictive.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to ordain women as priests and its requirement that priests remain celibate may be seen as limiting and outdated. While the Church views its priests as being devoted to God, it is hard to understand why they cannot have a family life like other professionals. It is reasonable to assume that having a spouse and children might not necessarily lead to a change in their work, just as it does not for many people in other careers.\n\nThe Church's adamant stance on certain issues might be driving away individuals who are looking for a more inclusive and accepting community. As a result, it is essential for the Church to re-evaluate its views and adapt to the changing values of society. By doing so, it may be possible to prevent further decline in its following and attract individuals who share its values but also expect a more nuanced approach to complex issues.",
            "The topic of same-sex marriage has garnered significant attention in recent years, with varying opinions on whether it should be recognized by law. From my perspective, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems that one's sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity.\n\nWhile I may not have extensively explored this topic, my stance is clear: I do not agree that the government should dictate who can and cannot get married based on their sexual orientation. I believe that this decision should be left to the individuals involved and those who care about them.\n\nThere is a misconception that people are born straight or gay, but the reality is that it's a complex issue that cannot be reduced to simple labels. However, I do believe that individuals should not be judged or penalized for who they are. The government's role in regulating marriage is not only unnecessary but also intrusive.\n\nIn my opinion, the government's involvement in same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security or moral values, but rather a personal matter that should be left to the individuals involved. It's essential to respect people's autonomy and allow them to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the federal government should not be involved in deciding who can get married and who cannot. This decision should be made by the individuals and those who care about them, not by the government. By doing so, we can promote a more accepting and inclusive society where everyone can live freely and authentically.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue for quite some time. However, as I've researched and considered the topic, I firmly believe that it's time for the federal government to reevaluate its stance on this matter. The primary reason for this is that there are numerous studies that demonstrate the similarities between same-sex relationships and traditional marriages. These studies indicate that both have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction, such as commitment, trust, and communication.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments against same-sex marriage is the notion that it poses a threat to the traditional family unit. However, this argument is based on a misconception that same-sex couples are fundamentally different from heterosexual couples. In reality, the dynamics of same-sex relationships are not significantly different from those of opposite-sex relationships. Both involve individuals forming emotional bonds, making long-term commitments, and contributing to their partner's well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that same-sex couples are seeking to marry in a church is a misconception. They are, in fact, seeking a legal recognition of their relationship in the form of a marriage certificate, a document issued by the government. By separating church and state, we can resolve the issue of religious disagreement and focus on the legal implications of marriage.\n\nThe concept of \"separate but equal\" is often used to describe the current system of civil unions, but this is a flawed analogy. In reality, same-sex couples are not being treated equally, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. This is evident in the areas of property taxes, healthcare, and adoption.\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding same-sex marriage is the impact on children. However, research suggests that children raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to experience difficulties than those raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, children of same-sex parents often face unique challenges, such as bullying and social stigma, which can be mitigated by providing support and education to the community.\n\nThe federal government should play a more active role in addressing these issues and promoting equality for all citizens. By making same-sex marriage legal in every state, we can ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The idea that morality is negotiable is a complex issue, and it's essential to consider the diverse perspectives and values of our society. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge the impact of misinformation and prejudice on public opinion. Many people base their opinions on misconceptions and stereotypes rather than evidence-based research. By promoting education and awareness, we can work towards a more informed and empathetic society.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be based on the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of all individuals, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society.",
            "When evaluating the availability of medicinal substances, it's crucial to separate the issue from societal stigmas. Working in a hospital pharmacy during the summer has given me a unique perspective on this matter. While certain substances may be prohibited due to their potential for abuse, their therapeutic benefits should not be dismissed outright.\n\nFor instance, many controlled substances that are illegal in their unregulated form are still used in pharmacies to treat a range of conditions. Medications like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples of controlled substances with proven medical value. Their benefits cannot be ignored solely because of their illicit status.\n\nSimilarly, marijuana possesses medicinal properties that warrant consideration. The fact that it is often associated with negative connotations should not overshadow its potential benefits. If we can differentiate between the substance itself and its potential for abuse, we can begin to reevaluate its role in healthcare.\n\nTo address concerns about responsible use, a gradual approach to legalization could be more effective than a sudden change. By removing the stigma surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more informed and responsible attitude towards its use.\n\nThe misconception surrounding marijuana stems from its reputation as an illicit substance. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively moderate. By reframing our understanding of marijuana, we may be able to promote more responsible use and its integration into medical practices.\n\nUltimately, a nuanced approach to substance regulation can help us make more informed decisions about the role of marijuana in healthcare.",
            "While reflecting on the evolution of my childhood church, I've observed a noticeable shift towards a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms; instead, the church has adapted to the 21st century's changing values. Sundays now observe a more casual dress code, with attendees often sporting jeans and casual wear, especially during the summer months. This shift is particularly evident in the condensed 30-minute masses, which cater to the busy lives of young families.\n\nAs I reminisce about my own experiences at a private school, I recall the weekly ritual of attending church with my friends. We'd dress up in our Sunday best, complete with matching outfits and accessories. However, even back then, the church was evolving, and this gradual change has continued over the years.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one. While some argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I disagree. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that transcends societal norms and religious affiliations. Statistics show that married individuals can still struggle with these impulses, and it's ultimately a matter of personal choice rather than a symptom of their marital status.\n\nIn fact, some denominations that allow their clergy to marry, such as certain Protestant churches, still struggle with these issues. It's essential to recognize that pedophilia is often a product of genetic predisposition and not a result of upbringing or environment. While genetic factors may play a significant role, it's also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with these tendencies often try to conceal them, even through marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church's adaptation to modern times is noteworthy, I don't believe that changes in their policies would have prevented the recent scandals. It's essential to address the root causes of these issues and hold those responsible accountable, rather than placing blame on the institution itself.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially had reservations about the premise, which I believe was largely overshadowed by the lingering sentiments following the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration used the threat of Iraq as a pretext for invasion, fueled by claims linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, which have since been discredited. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me, as it suggests a blatant disregard for the truth and a willingness to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe Bush administration's propensity for deception has been a recurring theme throughout their tenure, with even high-ranking officials like Colin Powell later expressing doubts about the evidence they presented at the time. This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The notion that they have consistently disregarded constitutional principles, particularly in the post-9/11 era, is troubling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were likely multifaceted, with some speculating that the younger Bush sought to expand the country's energy resources, a goal that was allegedly influenced by his father's administration. This underhanded approach to governance is concerning, particularly given the devastating consequences of the war.\n\nWhile I believe the conflict has dragged on for far too long, a hasty withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, potentially resulting in civil war and increased casualties. The proposed solution, involving a coalition of regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be the most effective approach, as it could further erode Iraq's sovereignty and create new challenges for the country's fragile government. The Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the influence of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nUltimately, the complex situation in Iraq has left me searching for a clear and effective solution, but one that balances the need for stability with the importance of respecting the country's sovereignty and promoting accountability within the political process.",
            "When considering the complexities of the Iraq War, my thoughts are multifaceted and influenced by various factors. It's essential to acknowledge that the conflict was not officially declared by Congress, which raises questions about its legitimacy. At the same time, it's crucial to remember that the initial motivations behind the war were in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were perpetrated by terrorists believed to have ties to Iraq.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that the war has become a protracted and complex issue, with multiple factors at play. The primary goal of establishing democracy in Iraq has been a driving force behind our continued presence, but it's also clear that this process is a long-term endeavor that cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, the war has resulted in significant human suffering and loss, including the displacement of families and the disruption of communities.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the cultural divide between our societies. While it's essential to acknowledge the right to self-determination, our attempts to impose our values and system on Iraq may ultimately exacerbate the problem. This could lead to a deepening hatred towards the United States and the proliferation of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has become a quagmire that will continue to plague us for years to come. It's essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to reevaluate our goals and strategies. While it's difficult to provide a clear solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complexities of the conflict and the cultural and historical context of Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the war in Iraq presents a complex web of issues that require thoughtful consideration and a multifaceted approach. It's essential to engage in a national dialogue that takes into account the various perspectives and interests at play, with the goal of finding a path forward that promotes peace, stability, and the well-being of the Iraqi people.",
            "The concept of government intervention in matters of religious freedom has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The First Amendment, with its explicit mention of the separation of church and state, serves as a cornerstone for the nation's commitment to religious tolerance. However, there are those who advocate for government involvement in regulating the practices of various faiths.\n\nIn my opinion, such an approach is misguided and contravenes the principles enshrined in the Constitution. By attempting to impose its will on matters of faith, the government would be overstepping its authority and infringing upon the rights of religious institutions. The Constitution's Founding Fathers deliberately established a framework that ensures the separation of church and state, allowing for the free exercise of religion without interference from the government.\n\nMoreover, the notion that the government should dictate what is permissible in a particular faith is a slippery slope. It would inevitably lead to favoritism, where the government would be choosing one denomination over another, potentially stifling the diversity of religious expression that is so essential to American society. The example of Catholic and Christian opposition to this particular issue in certain regions highlights the potential for favoritism and the danger of government overreach.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for the coexistence of various faiths in harmony. Any attempt to undermine this fundamental aspect of the Constitution would be a step backward, potentially restricting the rights of individuals and institutions rather than protecting them. In light of this, I believe it is essential to maintain the status quo and allow religious institutions to govern themselves, free from government interference.\n\nThe motivation behind government intervention in this matter appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good. The potential consequences of such an amendment would be far-reaching, and it is uncertain how it would impact the economy or society as a whole. It is crucial to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal opinions to dictate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should refrain from intervening in matters of faith, allowing religious institutions to operate freely and autonomously. The Constitution's founders wisely established a framework that prioritizes individual freedom and diversity, and it is our duty to uphold these principles and preserve the integrity of our democracy.",
            "The Iraq War has left a lasting impact on the world, and I believe the US government's motives for invading Iraq were not entirely transparent. Many people felt that the administration used the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This raised questions about the government's honesty with the American people. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to preemptive war, and I believe that the invasion of Iraq followed a pattern similar to the Vietnam War. Both conflicts involved an attempt to impose democracy on a foreign nation, which often results in a complex and challenging process. The removal of a country's government can lead to chaos and instability, and I think the US government underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding a new government in Iraq.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been significant, with many American lives lost. I believe that the administration failed to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, including the power vacuum that would be left by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. This lack of planning has led to ongoing instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe idea of spreading democracy is admirable, but it's a difficult and time-consuming process. Implementing a new form of government requires patience, understanding, and a deep knowledge of the local culture. In our own country, democracy was not established overnight, and it took many years of struggle and conflict to achieve.\n\nThe war in Iraq has also raised questions about the role of the US in global politics. I think the government's actions were motivated by a desire to control resources, particularly oil. The lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to accusations that the administration was not truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue, and the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences. I hope that the conflict will eventually come to an end and that a lasting peace will be established in the region. However, I fear that this may not be the case.",
            "My stance on gay marriage has been consistent - I firmly support the right to same-sex unions. I believe this is a matter of personal preference, and recent scientific discoveries have shown that sexuality can be influenced by biological factors rather than solely by societal influences. It's hard to justify denying individuals their rights due to something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's essential to separate politics and government from personal choices, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Marriage is a deeply personal commitment that should not be subject to external regulations. In fact, seeing same-sex couples in my neighborhood, who live and interact like any other family, has only strengthened my conviction.\n\nThe notion that politicians, like the previous administration, try to impose their interpretation of marriage on the public is not only misguided but also an overreach of power. I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a topic for public debate or scrutiny.\n\nResearch has shown that genetic and biological factors can contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. For instance, studies suggest that some people may be predisposed to be homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or environment. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting and respecting people's choices, rather than trying to justify discrimination.\n\nIn my opinion, the distinction between gay and heterosexual couples seeking marriage should not be a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so privately, without drawing attention to themselves. Conversely, if a same-sex couple wants to formalize their relationship, it's not right that it becomes a media sensation. This highlights the need to treat all relationships with equal respect and avoid making them the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "The internet has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of communication: its inherent public nature. As we've seen firsthand in our community, postings made online can have far-reaching consequences. As a Residential Advisor, I've had to navigate this issue personally, and it's a valuable lesson I've learned.\n\nWhen individuals share information online, they must consider the potential impact on their reputation. Sharing sensitive or inflammatory content can lead to misinterpretation and garner unwanted attention. This is particularly concerning when discussing topics like violence or threats, which can be misinterpreted or taken out of context. In such cases, school authorities often feel compelled to act, as they have a responsibility to ensure student safety.\n\nThe proliferation of social media has made it increasingly difficult to discern what's genuine and what's not. It's not uncommon for people to post humorous or thought-provoking content that's later misinterpreted or taken seriously. In one instance, a situation arose on our campus when a student's online posting was misinterpreted, leading to a thorough investigation. The individual in question had posted content that, in hindsight, may have been intended as a joke, but it sparked concern and warranted a closer look.\n\nThe internet's lack of inherent privacy is a critical aspect of online interactions. If an individual chooses to share information online, they should be prepared for it to be accessed by others. This includes school officials, who may be alerted to concerning content by students or parents. While it's essential to respect students' online autonomy, school authorities have a responsibility to act when they become aware of potential threats or dangers.\n\nIn terms of monitoring online activity, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between respecting students' online lives and protecting their safety. While I don't think school officials should engage in extensive surveillance, I do believe that they have a right to address concerns brought to their attention. This can be done by working with the individual or their parents to address the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for individuals to be mindful of their online presence and the potential consequences of their actions. As a Residential Advisor, I strive to educate my residents about the importance of responsible online behavior and the potential impact of their online actions on their reputation and well-being.",
            "The war has been prolonged for an unnecessarily extensive period, raising concerns about its original objectives. Initially, the intention to establish democracy in another country seemed justifiable, particularly considering the absence of a fair political system. However, it appears that the purpose has become increasingly distorted over time.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder if the war was instigated by personal grievances of the past, such as the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the primary goal was to introduce democracy, it would have been a commendable endeavor, but the presence of personal agendas would have tainted the mission.\n\nIt seems that the initial momentum was sufficient to convey a strong message, particularly in the early stages of the conflict. Nevertheless, the war has persisted for an inordinate amount of time, with the continuation of hostilities becoming increasingly questionable.\n\nIf the primary objective was to topple a tyrannical regime and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble pursuit. However, it appears that the motivations have become muddled over time, and the war has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe war has been waged for an excessive duration, and it is high time for a conclusion. The government of the invaded country must eventually be self-sufficient, and it is likely that this point has already been reached. The financial burden of the war is substantial, with billions of dollars being diverted from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare.\n\nThe allocation of funds to a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose is a concern, particularly when domestic problems are left unaddressed. The money spent on the war could be better utilized to address pressing issues within the country, such as education, healthcare, and public services.",
            "The question of whether schools should monitor students' online activities is a complex issue. While some may argue that privacy is compromised when individuals share personal information online, it's essential to consider the context in which this information is shared.\n\nWhen users post content on social media platforms like Myspace, they are, in effect, granting permission to a select group of individuals to view their profiles. This can include friends, classmates, and even acquaintances. While this may seem like an invasion of privacy on the surface, it's essential to recognize that individuals have some control over who can view their content.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether monitoring students' online activities is a viable solution to prevent potential threats. While it's unrealistic to expect a single individual to constantly monitor every student's profile, it's also difficult to justify discriminating against certain groups of students based on their online behavior.\n\nUltimately, the line between monitoring and surveillance is blurred. While some may argue that monitoring is necessary to prevent potential harm, others believe that it's an invasion of students' rights. The scenario where someone uses online information to prevent a life from being lost raises important questions about the role of social media in ensuring student safety.\n\nPersonally, having a social media presence can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, it allows individuals to connect with friends and maintain relationships. On the other hand, it can also expose users to potential risks, such as online harassment or stalking. As someone who uses Facebook, I'm aware of the importance of being cautious when sharing personal information online.\n\nA recent incident I saw on TV highlighted the ease with which individuals can gather information about others online. This raised concerns about the potential consequences of sharing personal details, such as screen names and class schedules, on social media. However, I also recognize the value of social media in maintaining relationships and staying connected with friends.\n\nThe issue of social media monitoring in schools is another area of concern. In some cases, schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, sparking questions about the extent of their authority to regulate students' online activities. While this may be seen as a way to ensure student safety, it's also essential to consider the implications for students' freedom of expression and online freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of social media monitoring is a nuanced one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. As we navigate the complexities of online interactions, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of our actions and the importance of balancing individual rights with the need for student safety.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and I must admit that discussing it makes me feel uncomfortable. Reflecting on my own stance, I realize that I initially opposed the invasion, aligning with the prevailing public opinion at the time. However, the ongoing debate has led me to question the war's validity. A significant majority of global citizens, including Iraqis and U.S. troops stationed in the region, share my initial concerns. According to various polls, roughly 75-80% of the international community believes the invasion was a misguided decision.\n\nThe complexities of the situation are evident when considering the cultural and historical context of the Middle East. The significant cultural disparities between the U.S. and the region create a challenging environment for implementing democracy. It's essential to acknowledge that the people of Iraq would have chosen a different approach to governance, rather than one imposed by an external force.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a problematic leader, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons before embarking on a costly and potentially disastrous intervention. The consequences of the invasion have been severe, and the ongoing occupation has created a seemingly intractable situation.\n\nI'm not convinced by the administration's arguments for continued involvement. While they may have valid concerns about the potential consequences of a hasty withdrawal, I'm yet to be persuaded by their reasoning. A gradual exit strategy over the course of a year or more might be a more viable option. However, I struggle to see a compelling argument for prolonging the occupation.\n\nA striking statistic I encountered highlights the sentiment of the Iraqi people: a significant majority believes that the U.S. should leave within the year, with some even advocating for an immediate withdrawal. As we claim to be intervening to help the Iraqi people, it's worth considering their perspective and potential solutions that prioritize their needs and desires.\n\nUltimately, even if we were to withdraw, we could still maintain a relationship with the Iraqi people and attempt to rectify any harm caused. This approach would at least ensure that we're not exacerbating the situation and could potentially be seen as a more humanitarian gesture. However, it's essential to acknowledge that our actions in the Middle East have not been without controversy, and it's uncertain whether we can ever fully be viewed as benevolent actors in the region.",
            "While it's undeniable that progress has been made in reducing inequality, I firmly believe that the United States still grapples with significant gender biases. It's essential to acknowledge that these prejudices can manifest differently depending on the specific industry and societal context.\n\nIn the professional sphere, the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where women face difficulties in advancing to leadership positions, persists. Despite having the necessary qualifications, women often encounter resistance to their promotion due to deeply ingrained societal expectations. This bias is not limited to women; men in traditionally masculine fields like business and industry may also face challenges. For instance, a male staying at home with children may be met with skepticism, as societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\n\nSimilarly, in the fashion industry, there's a tendency to dismiss men who are passionate about fashion, assuming that their interests are not truly authentic. This attitude can be attributed to a narrow understanding of masculinity and the expectation that men should conform to traditional norms.\n\nEfforts to combat these biases are hindered by the deeply ingrained nature of these attitudes. However, there are signs of progress, such as women rising to leadership positions and increasing acceptance of stay-at-home dads. To accelerate change, it's crucial to promote the qualities and achievements of individuals who defy traditional stereotypes, rather than forcing them upon others. A delicate balance must be struck between pushing for progress and avoiding resistance.\n\nInterestingly, biases can also manifest across different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations. For instance, an individual from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those with more refined communication skills, despite being highly intelligent and capable. This highlights the complexity of the issue, which extends beyond gender to include factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to recognize that overcoming these biases will require a sustained effort and a nuanced understanding of the various factors at play.",
            "My understanding is that the substance in question has undergone a significant transformation in the legal sphere. While it was previously considered a criminal offense, it has been decriminalized, essentially relegating it to a fine-able infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change eliminates the need for arrests, court appearances, and the associated costs that come with them. However, the ramifications of being caught with the substance still persist, particularly in terms of job prospects and social implications.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of decriminalization is the financial aspect. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for the substance is costly, and the resources allocated to this endeavor could be redirected towards more pressing community needs. Municipalities grappling with financial constraints may be hesitant to adopt such a policy, even if it would yield significant financial benefits.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, has taken a more progressive stance, and the city has reportedly seen a substantial increase in available funds for public education, social programs, and other community initiatives. While it's essential to consider the potential consequences of widespread use, the financial benefits of decriminalization cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the substance's potential impact on society is multifaceted. While some may view it as a relatively benign substance, others may be uncomfortable with its presence in public spaces. The fear of impaired driving and the ongoing stigma surrounding the substance's use are valid concerns.\n\nThe effects of the substance vary greatly from person to person, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about its impact. Some individuals may be able to moderate their use, while others may struggle with its consequences. Both the substance in question and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with nuance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize the substance is a complex one, influenced by a range of factors, including personal attitudes, societal norms, and financial considerations.",
            "While I agree with many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that adaptability to change is essential. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, but it's equally important to ensure that these customs don't hinder its ability to grow and evolve. \n\nOne area where the Catholic Church's strict adherence to doctrine and tradition can be problematic is in its stance on interfaith relationships. For instance, my parents, one a practicing Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This experience made me realize that the Church's exclusivity can sometimes lead to a lack of tolerance for those who don't conform to its teachings.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between Catholic doctrine and practice is another area of concern. The Church's emphasis on love and acceptance is contradicted by its refusal to accept those who don't meet its standards. This paradox can be jarring, especially when considering the long history of the Church.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that marriage could help prevent instances of misconduct, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that often involves a pattern of behavior rather than a specific circumstance. Therefore, I'm not sure that allowing priests to marry would be a deterrent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's traditional approach can be both a strength and a weakness. While its commitment to its teachings is admirable, it's essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of its strict adherence to doctrine and tradition. By acknowledging these complexities, the Church can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach.",
            "The issue at hand presents a complex challenge, as it navigates the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. This dichotomy is particularly tricky to resolve without alienating certain groups. Ultimately, my stance on the matter remains unclear, as I find it difficult to definitively assert the legitimacy of either perspective.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the distinction between marriage and civil unions is a crucial point of contention. The fact that civil unions confer similar benefits to those of marriage, such as tax advantages, suggests that the government should not dictate the legitimacy of a union based on its religious connotations. In essence, a civil union merely represents a legally recognized partnership between two individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nIf we were to view marriage solely as a civil institution, we could avoid conflating church and state. This would also enable the government to focus on the practical aspects of marriage, such as the union of two individuals, rather than its spiritual or religious undertones. Consequently, the legalization of gay marriage would not be a contentious issue, as it would be recognized as a civil union, akin to any other.\n\nIf a consensus is reached among the states, it would be reasonable to push for federal legislation to codify this understanding. However, I strongly believe that banning gay marriage by way of a constitutional amendment is an extreme measure. The Constitution should not be amended to address a matter of such limited significance, particularly when it would disproportionately affect a minority group.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of gay marriage should not be elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment. It is not a matter of sufficient magnitude to warrant such a drastic measure, and it is essential to maintain a separation between church and state to ensure that the government does not impose its values on its citizens.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have often grappled with the complexities of the LGBTQ+ community. While my upbringing has informed my views, it has also led me to appreciate the diversity of perspectives within this issue. My friends who identify as gay have shown me the importance of understanding and empathy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their personal lives, free from undue influence from the federal government. I think that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach acknowledges the differences in cultural values and societal norms that exist between various regions.\n\nI recognize that some states, particularly those with a predominantly democratic lean, may be more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights. However, I also believe that individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local values and decisions that come with that choice.\n\nWhile the current federal ban on gay marriage has been a topic of controversy, I think it's essential to consider the implications of a federal decision on the lives of individuals. In my opinion, the president's role should be to ensure that each state has the freedom to make its own decisions, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe changing landscape of U.S. politics, including the upcoming presidential election, underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. Rather than relying on a federal mandate, I believe that states should have the authority to decide what works best for their communities. This approach would allow for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that each state should have the autonomy to make its own decisions regarding same-sex marriage, rather than deferring to the federal government. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "When considering the implications of school officials monitoring student online activity, it's essential to acknowledge that social media platforms like Myspace are, by definition, public spaces. As such, any information posted on these platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. In the context of preventing potential harm, such as school shootings, it's reasonable to assume that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety.\n\nIn this light, if school officials discover content on Myspace that indicates students are engaging in illicit behavior, it's not an invasion of privacy if they take action to address the issue. In fact, it's a necessary step in maintaining a secure learning environment. This approach is analogous to the measures taken in schools to prepare for potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness.\n\nFor instance, my own high school experience involved regular lockdown drills and safety protocols, which were implemented in response to national security concerns, including the possibility of terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to school shootings, the underlying principle is the same: to create a safe and secure environment for students.\n\nIn the specific case of school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and create a safer school environment. While some might view this as an invasion of privacy, it's essential to weigh this against the potential consequences of inaction. By taking proactive steps to address potential threats, school officials can help prevent incidents like the Columbine shooting.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring student online activity is complex and multifaceted. However, when considering the potential consequences of inaction, it's clear that proactive measures to ensure student safety are justified.",
            "The events following the catastrophic events of 9/11 had a profound impact on America's foreign policy. Initially, I was in favor of taking a proactive approach to address the threat posed by terrorism. However, as time passed, I began to question the strategic decisions made by our government. It is my opinion that the war in Iraq was fought without a clear plan or a thorough understanding of the consequences. The emotional response to 9/11 led to a hasty decision-making process that prioritized immediate action over long-term strategy.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the local culture. Our military intervention was met with resistance, and the conflict escalated. The war in Iraq has been a protracted and costly endeavor that has yielded limited progress. I now question the effectiveness of our presence in the region.\n\nOne of the primary concerns I have is that our efforts have not led to lasting stability in Iraq. The ongoing conflict between various factions has hindered our ability to make a meaningful impact. I firmly believe that as long as these groups are engaged in internal power struggles, they will be unable to focus on external threats, including those posed by the United States. In my opinion, our continued involvement in the conflict is not a viable solution.\n\nMoreover, I think it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of war differs significantly between Western and Middle Eastern cultures. The aftermath of war in Iraq has been marked by chaos, and I fear that our military presence has only exacerbated the situation. It appears to me that the primary objective of our involvement was to remove Saddam Hussein from power, rather than to establish a stable and self-sufficient government.\n\nA more considered approach might have yielded better results. A more nuanced understanding of the local dynamics and a clear plan for our objectives could have led to a more effective and sustainable resolution. In my opinion, the war in Iraq was a product of a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy.\n\nLooking back, I believe that our involvement in Iraq has been a costly and misguided endeavor. We should have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing diplomacy and international cooperation over military intervention. In the end, I think our continued presence in the region is not a solution, but rather a cause of further instability."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its following, and one of the possible reasons for this trend may be its stance on certain issues. The Church's views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have been a point of contention for some people. These issues might be seen as outdated and not in line with the evolving values of society.\n\nThe Church's strict views on these matters may be alienating individuals who hold different opinions. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable joining a community that considers these practices morally wrong. Similarly, individuals who believe in the importance of marriage equality or reproductive freedom may feel that the Church's stance on these issues is too restrictive.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to ordain women as priests and its requirement that priests remain celibate may be seen as limiting and outdated. While the Church views its priests as being devoted to God, it is hard to understand why they cannot have a family life like other professionals. It is reasonable to assume that having a spouse and children might not necessarily lead to a change in their work, just as it does not for many people in other careers.\n\nThe Church's adamant stance on certain issues might be driving away individuals who are looking for a more inclusive and accepting community. As a result, it is essential for the Church to re-evaluate its views and adapt to the changing values of society. By doing so, it may be possible to prevent further decline in its following and attract individuals who share its values but also expect a more nuanced approach to complex issues.",
            "The topic of same-sex marriage has garnered significant attention in recent years, with varying opinions on whether it should be recognized by law. From my perspective, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems that one's sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity.\n\nWhile I may not have extensively explored this topic, my stance is clear: I do not agree that the government should dictate who can and cannot get married based on their sexual orientation. I believe that this decision should be left to the individuals involved and those who care about them.\n\nThere is a misconception that people are born straight or gay, but the reality is that it's a complex issue that cannot be reduced to simple labels. However, I do believe that individuals should not be judged or penalized for who they are. The government's role in regulating marriage is not only unnecessary but also intrusive.\n\nIn my opinion, the government's involvement in same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security or moral values, but rather a personal matter that should be left to the individuals involved. It's essential to respect people's autonomy and allow them to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the federal government should not be involved in deciding who can get married and who cannot. This decision should be made by the individuals and those who care about them, not by the government. By doing so, we can promote a more accepting and inclusive society where everyone can live freely and authentically.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue for quite some time. However, as I've researched and considered the topic, I firmly believe that it's time for the federal government to reevaluate its stance on this matter. The primary reason for this is that there are numerous studies that demonstrate the similarities between same-sex relationships and traditional marriages. These studies indicate that both have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction, such as commitment, trust, and communication.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments against same-sex marriage is the notion that it poses a threat to the traditional family unit. However, this argument is based on a misconception that same-sex couples are fundamentally different from heterosexual couples. In reality, the dynamics of same-sex relationships are not significantly different from those of opposite-sex relationships. Both involve individuals forming emotional bonds, making long-term commitments, and contributing to their partner's well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that same-sex couples are seeking to marry in a church is a misconception. They are, in fact, seeking a legal recognition of their relationship in the form of a marriage certificate, a document issued by the government. By separating church and state, we can resolve the issue of religious disagreement and focus on the legal implications of marriage.\n\nThe concept of \"separate but equal\" is often used to describe the current system of civil unions, but this is a flawed analogy. In reality, same-sex couples are not being treated equally, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. This is evident in the areas of property taxes, healthcare, and adoption.\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding same-sex marriage is the impact on children. However, research suggests that children raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to experience difficulties than those raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, children of same-sex parents often face unique challenges, such as bullying and social stigma, which can be mitigated by providing support and education to the community.\n\nThe federal government should play a more active role in addressing these issues and promoting equality for all citizens. By making same-sex marriage legal in every state, we can ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The idea that morality is negotiable is a complex issue, and it's essential to consider the diverse perspectives and values of our society. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge the impact of misinformation and prejudice on public opinion. Many people base their opinions on misconceptions and stereotypes rather than evidence-based research. By promoting education and awareness, we can work towards a more informed and empathetic society.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be based on the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of all individuals, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society.",
            "When evaluating the availability of medicinal substances, it's crucial to separate the issue from societal stigmas. Working in a hospital pharmacy during the summer has given me a unique perspective on this matter. While certain substances may be prohibited due to their potential for abuse, their therapeutic benefits should not be dismissed outright.\n\nFor instance, many controlled substances that are illegal in their unregulated form are still used in pharmacies to treat a range of conditions. Medications like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples of controlled substances with proven medical value. Their benefits cannot be ignored solely because of their illicit status.\n\nSimilarly, marijuana possesses medicinal properties that warrant consideration. The fact that it is often associated with negative connotations should not overshadow its potential benefits. If we can differentiate between the substance itself and its potential for abuse, we can begin to reevaluate its role in healthcare.\n\nTo address concerns about responsible use, a gradual approach to legalization could be more effective than a sudden change. By removing the stigma surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more informed and responsible attitude towards its use.\n\nThe misconception surrounding marijuana stems from its reputation as an illicit substance. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively moderate. By reframing our understanding of marijuana, we may be able to promote more responsible use and its integration into medical practices.\n\nUltimately, a nuanced approach to substance regulation can help us make more informed decisions about the role of marijuana in healthcare.",
            "While reflecting on the evolution of my childhood church, I've observed a noticeable shift towards a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms; instead, the church has adapted to the 21st century's changing values. Sundays now observe a more casual dress code, with attendees often sporting jeans and casual wear, especially during the summer months. This shift is particularly evident in the condensed 30-minute masses, which cater to the busy lives of young families.\n\nAs I reminisce about my own experiences at a private school, I recall the weekly ritual of attending church with my friends. We'd dress up in our Sunday best, complete with matching outfits and accessories. However, even back then, the church was evolving, and this gradual change has continued over the years.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one. While some argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I disagree. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that transcends societal norms and religious affiliations. Statistics show that married individuals can still struggle with these impulses, and it's ultimately a matter of personal choice rather than a symptom of their marital status.\n\nIn fact, some denominations that allow their clergy to marry, such as certain Protestant churches, still struggle with these issues. It's essential to recognize that pedophilia is often a product of genetic predisposition and not a result of upbringing or environment. While genetic factors may play a significant role, it's also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with these tendencies often try to conceal them, even through marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church's adaptation to modern times is noteworthy, I don't believe that changes in their policies would have prevented the recent scandals. It's essential to address the root causes of these issues and hold those responsible accountable, rather than placing blame on the institution itself.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially had reservations about the premise, which I believe was largely overshadowed by the lingering sentiments following the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration used the threat of Iraq as a pretext for invasion, fueled by claims linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, which have since been discredited. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me, as it suggests a blatant disregard for the truth and a willingness to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe Bush administration's propensity for deception has been a recurring theme throughout their tenure, with even high-ranking officials like Colin Powell later expressing doubts about the evidence they presented at the time. This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The notion that they have consistently disregarded constitutional principles, particularly in the post-9/11 era, is troubling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were likely multifaceted, with some speculating that the younger Bush sought to expand the country's energy resources, a goal that was allegedly influenced by his father's administration. This underhanded approach to governance is concerning, particularly given the devastating consequences of the war.\n\nWhile I believe the conflict has dragged on for far too long, a hasty withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, potentially resulting in civil war and increased casualties. The proposed solution, involving a coalition of regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be the most effective approach, as it could further erode Iraq's sovereignty and create new challenges for the country's fragile government. The Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the influence of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nUltimately, the complex situation in Iraq has left me searching for a clear and effective solution, but one that balances the need for stability with the importance of respecting the country's sovereignty and promoting accountability within the political process.",
            "When considering the complexities of the Iraq War, my thoughts are multifaceted and influenced by various factors. It's essential to acknowledge that the conflict was not officially declared by Congress, which raises questions about its legitimacy. At the same time, it's crucial to remember that the initial motivations behind the war were in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were perpetrated by terrorists believed to have ties to Iraq.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that the war has become a protracted and complex issue, with multiple factors at play. The primary goal of establishing democracy in Iraq has been a driving force behind our continued presence, but it's also clear that this process is a long-term endeavor that cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, the war has resulted in significant human suffering and loss, including the displacement of families and the disruption of communities.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the cultural divide between our societies. While it's essential to acknowledge the right to self-determination, our attempts to impose our values and system on Iraq may ultimately exacerbate the problem. This could lead to a deepening hatred towards the United States and the proliferation of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has become a quagmire that will continue to plague us for years to come. It's essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to reevaluate our goals and strategies. While it's difficult to provide a clear solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complexities of the conflict and the cultural and historical context of Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the war in Iraq presents a complex web of issues that require thoughtful consideration and a multifaceted approach. It's essential to engage in a national dialogue that takes into account the various perspectives and interests at play, with the goal of finding a path forward that promotes peace, stability, and the well-being of the Iraqi people.",
            "The concept of government intervention in matters of religious freedom has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The First Amendment, with its explicit mention of the separation of church and state, serves as a cornerstone for the nation's commitment to religious tolerance. However, there are those who advocate for government involvement in regulating the practices of various faiths.\n\nIn my opinion, such an approach is misguided and contravenes the principles enshrined in the Constitution. By attempting to impose its will on matters of faith, the government would be overstepping its authority and infringing upon the rights of religious institutions. The Constitution's Founding Fathers deliberately established a framework that ensures the separation of church and state, allowing for the free exercise of religion without interference from the government.\n\nMoreover, the notion that the government should dictate what is permissible in a particular faith is a slippery slope. It would inevitably lead to favoritism, where the government would be choosing one denomination over another, potentially stifling the diversity of religious expression that is so essential to American society. The example of Catholic and Christian opposition to this particular issue in certain regions highlights the potential for favoritism and the danger of government overreach.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for the coexistence of various faiths in harmony. Any attempt to undermine this fundamental aspect of the Constitution would be a step backward, potentially restricting the rights of individuals and institutions rather than protecting them. In light of this, I believe it is essential to maintain the status quo and allow religious institutions to govern themselves, free from government interference.\n\nThe motivation behind government intervention in this matter appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good. The potential consequences of such an amendment would be far-reaching, and it is uncertain how it would impact the economy or society as a whole. It is crucial to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal opinions to dictate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should refrain from intervening in matters of faith, allowing religious institutions to operate freely and autonomously. The Constitution's founders wisely established a framework that prioritizes individual freedom and diversity, and it is our duty to uphold these principles and preserve the integrity of our democracy.",
            "The Iraq War has left a lasting impact on the world, and I believe the US government's motives for invading Iraq were not entirely transparent. Many people felt that the administration used the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This raised questions about the government's honesty with the American people. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to preemptive war, and I believe that the invasion of Iraq followed a pattern similar to the Vietnam War. Both conflicts involved an attempt to impose democracy on a foreign nation, which often results in a complex and challenging process. The removal of a country's government can lead to chaos and instability, and I think the US government underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding a new government in Iraq.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been significant, with many American lives lost. I believe that the administration failed to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, including the power vacuum that would be left by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. This lack of planning has led to ongoing instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe idea of spreading democracy is admirable, but it's a difficult and time-consuming process. Implementing a new form of government requires patience, understanding, and a deep knowledge of the local culture. In our own country, democracy was not established overnight, and it took many years of struggle and conflict to achieve.\n\nThe war in Iraq has also raised questions about the role of the US in global politics. I think the government's actions were motivated by a desire to control resources, particularly oil. The lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to accusations that the administration was not truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue, and the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences. I hope that the conflict will eventually come to an end and that a lasting peace will be established in the region. However, I fear that this may not be the case.",
            "My stance on gay marriage has been consistent - I firmly support the right to same-sex unions. I believe this is a matter of personal preference, and recent scientific discoveries have shown that sexuality can be influenced by biological factors rather than solely by societal influences. It's hard to justify denying individuals their rights due to something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's essential to separate politics and government from personal choices, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Marriage is a deeply personal commitment that should not be subject to external regulations. In fact, seeing same-sex couples in my neighborhood, who live and interact like any other family, has only strengthened my conviction.\n\nThe notion that politicians, like the previous administration, try to impose their interpretation of marriage on the public is not only misguided but also an overreach of power. I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a topic for public debate or scrutiny.\n\nResearch has shown that genetic and biological factors can contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. For instance, studies suggest that some people may be predisposed to be homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or environment. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting and respecting people's choices, rather than trying to justify discrimination.\n\nIn my opinion, the distinction between gay and heterosexual couples seeking marriage should not be a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so privately, without drawing attention to themselves. Conversely, if a same-sex couple wants to formalize their relationship, it's not right that it becomes a media sensation. This highlights the need to treat all relationships with equal respect and avoid making them the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "The internet has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of communication: its inherent public nature. As we've seen firsthand in our community, postings made online can have far-reaching consequences. As a Residential Advisor, I've had to navigate this issue personally, and it's a valuable lesson I've learned.\n\nWhen individuals share information online, they must consider the potential impact on their reputation. Sharing sensitive or inflammatory content can lead to misinterpretation and garner unwanted attention. This is particularly concerning when discussing topics like violence or threats, which can be misinterpreted or taken out of context. In such cases, school authorities often feel compelled to act, as they have a responsibility to ensure student safety.\n\nThe proliferation of social media has made it increasingly difficult to discern what's genuine and what's not. It's not uncommon for people to post humorous or thought-provoking content that's later misinterpreted or taken seriously. In one instance, a situation arose on our campus when a student's online posting was misinterpreted, leading to a thorough investigation. The individual in question had posted content that, in hindsight, may have been intended as a joke, but it sparked concern and warranted a closer look.\n\nThe internet's lack of inherent privacy is a critical aspect of online interactions. If an individual chooses to share information online, they should be prepared for it to be accessed by others. This includes school officials, who may be alerted to concerning content by students or parents. While it's essential to respect students' online autonomy, school authorities have a responsibility to act when they become aware of potential threats or dangers.\n\nIn terms of monitoring online activity, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between respecting students' online lives and protecting their safety. While I don't think school officials should engage in extensive surveillance, I do believe that they have a right to address concerns brought to their attention. This can be done by working with the individual or their parents to address the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for individuals to be mindful of their online presence and the potential consequences of their actions. As a Residential Advisor, I strive to educate my residents about the importance of responsible online behavior and the potential impact of their online actions on their reputation and well-being.",
            "The war has been prolonged for an unnecessarily extensive period, raising concerns about its original objectives. Initially, the intention to establish democracy in another country seemed justifiable, particularly considering the absence of a fair political system. However, it appears that the purpose has become increasingly distorted over time.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder if the war was instigated by personal grievances of the past, such as the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the primary goal was to introduce democracy, it would have been a commendable endeavor, but the presence of personal agendas would have tainted the mission.\n\nIt seems that the initial momentum was sufficient to convey a strong message, particularly in the early stages of the conflict. Nevertheless, the war has persisted for an inordinate amount of time, with the continuation of hostilities becoming increasingly questionable.\n\nIf the primary objective was to topple a tyrannical regime and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble pursuit. However, it appears that the motivations have become muddled over time, and the war has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe war has been waged for an excessive duration, and it is high time for a conclusion. The government of the invaded country must eventually be self-sufficient, and it is likely that this point has already been reached. The financial burden of the war is substantial, with billions of dollars being diverted from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare.\n\nThe allocation of funds to a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose is a concern, particularly when domestic problems are left unaddressed. The money spent on the war could be better utilized to address pressing issues within the country, such as education, healthcare, and public services.",
            "The question of whether schools should monitor students' online activities is a complex issue. While some may argue that privacy is compromised when individuals share personal information online, it's essential to consider the context in which this information is shared.\n\nWhen users post content on social media platforms like Myspace, they are, in effect, granting permission to a select group of individuals to view their profiles. This can include friends, classmates, and even acquaintances. While this may seem like an invasion of privacy on the surface, it's essential to recognize that individuals have some control over who can view their content.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether monitoring students' online activities is a viable solution to prevent potential threats. While it's unrealistic to expect a single individual to constantly monitor every student's profile, it's also difficult to justify discriminating against certain groups of students based on their online behavior.\n\nUltimately, the line between monitoring and surveillance is blurred. While some may argue that monitoring is necessary to prevent potential harm, others believe that it's an invasion of students' rights. The scenario where someone uses online information to prevent a life from being lost raises important questions about the role of social media in ensuring student safety.\n\nPersonally, having a social media presence can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, it allows individuals to connect with friends and maintain relationships. On the other hand, it can also expose users to potential risks, such as online harassment or stalking. As someone who uses Facebook, I'm aware of the importance of being cautious when sharing personal information online.\n\nA recent incident I saw on TV highlighted the ease with which individuals can gather information about others online. This raised concerns about the potential consequences of sharing personal details, such as screen names and class schedules, on social media. However, I also recognize the value of social media in maintaining relationships and staying connected with friends.\n\nThe issue of social media monitoring in schools is another area of concern. In some cases, schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, sparking questions about the extent of their authority to regulate students' online activities. While this may be seen as a way to ensure student safety, it's also essential to consider the implications for students' freedom of expression and online freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of social media monitoring is a nuanced one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. As we navigate the complexities of online interactions, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of our actions and the importance of balancing individual rights with the need for student safety.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and I must admit that discussing it makes me feel uncomfortable. Reflecting on my own stance, I realize that I initially opposed the invasion, aligning with the prevailing public opinion at the time. However, the ongoing debate has led me to question the war's validity. A significant majority of global citizens, including Iraqis and U.S. troops stationed in the region, share my initial concerns. According to various polls, roughly 75-80% of the international community believes the invasion was a misguided decision.\n\nThe complexities of the situation are evident when considering the cultural and historical context of the Middle East. The significant cultural disparities between the U.S. and the region create a challenging environment for implementing democracy. It's essential to acknowledge that the people of Iraq would have chosen a different approach to governance, rather than one imposed by an external force.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a problematic leader, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons before embarking on a costly and potentially disastrous intervention. The consequences of the invasion have been severe, and the ongoing occupation has created a seemingly intractable situation.\n\nI'm not convinced by the administration's arguments for continued involvement. While they may have valid concerns about the potential consequences of a hasty withdrawal, I'm yet to be persuaded by their reasoning. A gradual exit strategy over the course of a year or more might be a more viable option. However, I struggle to see a compelling argument for prolonging the occupation.\n\nA striking statistic I encountered highlights the sentiment of the Iraqi people: a significant majority believes that the U.S. should leave within the year, with some even advocating for an immediate withdrawal. As we claim to be intervening to help the Iraqi people, it's worth considering their perspective and potential solutions that prioritize their needs and desires.\n\nUltimately, even if we were to withdraw, we could still maintain a relationship with the Iraqi people and attempt to rectify any harm caused. This approach would at least ensure that we're not exacerbating the situation and could potentially be seen as a more humanitarian gesture. However, it's essential to acknowledge that our actions in the Middle East have not been without controversy, and it's uncertain whether we can ever fully be viewed as benevolent actors in the region.",
            "While it's undeniable that progress has been made in reducing inequality, I firmly believe that the United States still grapples with significant gender biases. It's essential to acknowledge that these prejudices can manifest differently depending on the specific industry and societal context.\n\nIn the professional sphere, the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where women face difficulties in advancing to leadership positions, persists. Despite having the necessary qualifications, women often encounter resistance to their promotion due to deeply ingrained societal expectations. This bias is not limited to women; men in traditionally masculine fields like business and industry may also face challenges. For instance, a male staying at home with children may be met with skepticism, as societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\n\nSimilarly, in the fashion industry, there's a tendency to dismiss men who are passionate about fashion, assuming that their interests are not truly authentic. This attitude can be attributed to a narrow understanding of masculinity and the expectation that men should conform to traditional norms.\n\nEfforts to combat these biases are hindered by the deeply ingrained nature of these attitudes. However, there are signs of progress, such as women rising to leadership positions and increasing acceptance of stay-at-home dads. To accelerate change, it's crucial to promote the qualities and achievements of individuals who defy traditional stereotypes, rather than forcing them upon others. A delicate balance must be struck between pushing for progress and avoiding resistance.\n\nInterestingly, biases can also manifest across different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations. For instance, an individual from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those with more refined communication skills, despite being highly intelligent and capable. This highlights the complexity of the issue, which extends beyond gender to include factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to recognize that overcoming these biases will require a sustained effort and a nuanced understanding of the various factors at play.",
            "My understanding is that the substance in question has undergone a significant transformation in the legal sphere. While it was previously considered a criminal offense, it has been decriminalized, essentially relegating it to a fine-able infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change eliminates the need for arrests, court appearances, and the associated costs that come with them. However, the ramifications of being caught with the substance still persist, particularly in terms of job prospects and social implications.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of decriminalization is the financial aspect. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for the substance is costly, and the resources allocated to this endeavor could be redirected towards more pressing community needs. Municipalities grappling with financial constraints may be hesitant to adopt such a policy, even if it would yield significant financial benefits.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, has taken a more progressive stance, and the city has reportedly seen a substantial increase in available funds for public education, social programs, and other community initiatives. While it's essential to consider the potential consequences of widespread use, the financial benefits of decriminalization cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the substance's potential impact on society is multifaceted. While some may view it as a relatively benign substance, others may be uncomfortable with its presence in public spaces. The fear of impaired driving and the ongoing stigma surrounding the substance's use are valid concerns.\n\nThe effects of the substance vary greatly from person to person, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about its impact. Some individuals may be able to moderate their use, while others may struggle with its consequences. Both the substance in question and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with nuance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize the substance is a complex one, influenced by a range of factors, including personal attitudes, societal norms, and financial considerations.",
            "While I agree with many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that adaptability to change is essential. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, but it's equally important to ensure that these customs don't hinder its ability to grow and evolve. \n\nOne area where the Catholic Church's strict adherence to doctrine and tradition can be problematic is in its stance on interfaith relationships. For instance, my parents, one a practicing Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This experience made me realize that the Church's exclusivity can sometimes lead to a lack of tolerance for those who don't conform to its teachings.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between Catholic doctrine and practice is another area of concern. The Church's emphasis on love and acceptance is contradicted by its refusal to accept those who don't meet its standards. This paradox can be jarring, especially when considering the long history of the Church.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that marriage could help prevent instances of misconduct, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that often involves a pattern of behavior rather than a specific circumstance. Therefore, I'm not sure that allowing priests to marry would be a deterrent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's traditional approach can be both a strength and a weakness. While its commitment to its teachings is admirable, it's essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of its strict adherence to doctrine and tradition. By acknowledging these complexities, the Church can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach.",
            "The issue at hand presents a complex challenge, as it navigates the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. This dichotomy is particularly tricky to resolve without alienating certain groups. Ultimately, my stance on the matter remains unclear, as I find it difficult to definitively assert the legitimacy of either perspective.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the distinction between marriage and civil unions is a crucial point of contention. The fact that civil unions confer similar benefits to those of marriage, such as tax advantages, suggests that the government should not dictate the legitimacy of a union based on its religious connotations. In essence, a civil union merely represents a legally recognized partnership between two individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nIf we were to view marriage solely as a civil institution, we could avoid conflating church and state. This would also enable the government to focus on the practical aspects of marriage, such as the union of two individuals, rather than its spiritual or religious undertones. Consequently, the legalization of gay marriage would not be a contentious issue, as it would be recognized as a civil union, akin to any other.\n\nIf a consensus is reached among the states, it would be reasonable to push for federal legislation to codify this understanding. However, I strongly believe that banning gay marriage by way of a constitutional amendment is an extreme measure. The Constitution should not be amended to address a matter of such limited significance, particularly when it would disproportionately affect a minority group.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of gay marriage should not be elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment. It is not a matter of sufficient magnitude to warrant such a drastic measure, and it is essential to maintain a separation between church and state to ensure that the government does not impose its values on its citizens.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have often grappled with the complexities of the LGBTQ+ community. While my upbringing has informed my views, it has also led me to appreciate the diversity of perspectives within this issue. My friends who identify as gay have shown me the importance of understanding and empathy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their personal lives, free from undue influence from the federal government. I think that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach acknowledges the differences in cultural values and societal norms that exist between various regions.\n\nI recognize that some states, particularly those with a predominantly democratic lean, may be more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights. However, I also believe that individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local values and decisions that come with that choice.\n\nWhile the current federal ban on gay marriage has been a topic of controversy, I think it's essential to consider the implications of a federal decision on the lives of individuals. In my opinion, the president's role should be to ensure that each state has the freedom to make its own decisions, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe changing landscape of U.S. politics, including the upcoming presidential election, underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. Rather than relying on a federal mandate, I believe that states should have the authority to decide what works best for their communities. This approach would allow for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that each state should have the autonomy to make its own decisions regarding same-sex marriage, rather than deferring to the federal government. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "When considering the implications of school officials monitoring student online activity, it's essential to acknowledge that social media platforms like Myspace are, by definition, public spaces. As such, any information posted on these platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. In the context of preventing potential harm, such as school shootings, it's reasonable to assume that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety.\n\nIn this light, if school officials discover content on Myspace that indicates students are engaging in illicit behavior, it's not an invasion of privacy if they take action to address the issue. In fact, it's a necessary step in maintaining a secure learning environment. This approach is analogous to the measures taken in schools to prepare for potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness.\n\nFor instance, my own high school experience involved regular lockdown drills and safety protocols, which were implemented in response to national security concerns, including the possibility of terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to school shootings, the underlying principle is the same: to create a safe and secure environment for students.\n\nIn the specific case of school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and create a safer school environment. While some might view this as an invasion of privacy, it's essential to weigh this against the potential consequences of inaction. By taking proactive steps to address potential threats, school officials can help prevent incidents like the Columbine shooting.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring student online activity is complex and multifaceted. However, when considering the potential consequences of inaction, it's clear that proactive measures to ensure student safety are justified.",
            "The events following the catastrophic events of 9/11 had a profound impact on America's foreign policy. Initially, I was in favor of taking a proactive approach to address the threat posed by terrorism. However, as time passed, I began to question the strategic decisions made by our government. It is my opinion that the war in Iraq was fought without a clear plan or a thorough understanding of the consequences. The emotional response to 9/11 led to a hasty decision-making process that prioritized immediate action over long-term strategy.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the local culture. Our military intervention was met with resistance, and the conflict escalated. The war in Iraq has been a protracted and costly endeavor that has yielded limited progress. I now question the effectiveness of our presence in the region.\n\nOne of the primary concerns I have is that our efforts have not led to lasting stability in Iraq. The ongoing conflict between various factions has hindered our ability to make a meaningful impact. I firmly believe that as long as these groups are engaged in internal power struggles, they will be unable to focus on external threats, including those posed by the United States. In my opinion, our continued involvement in the conflict is not a viable solution.\n\nMoreover, I think it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of war differs significantly between Western and Middle Eastern cultures. The aftermath of war in Iraq has been marked by chaos, and I fear that our military presence has only exacerbated the situation. It appears to me that the primary objective of our involvement was to remove Saddam Hussein from power, rather than to establish a stable and self-sufficient government.\n\nA more considered approach might have yielded better results. A more nuanced understanding of the local dynamics and a clear plan for our objectives could have led to a more effective and sustainable resolution. In my opinion, the war in Iraq was a product of a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy.\n\nLooking back, I believe that our involvement in Iraq has been a costly and misguided endeavor. We should have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing diplomacy and international cooperation over military intervention. In the end, I think our continued presence in the region is not a solution, but rather a cause of further instability."
