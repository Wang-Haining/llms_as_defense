            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church's views on certain issues may be contributing to its declining membership. While it's natural for institutions to hold strong convictions, their stance on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control may be perceived as outdated by some. This perceived rigidity can lead individuals to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable within the Church.\n\nFor instance, when a person holds a different viewpoint on abortion or gay marriage, they may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and potentially even alienate individuals from the faith. Essentially, the Church's stance on these issues may be driving people away.\n\nOne potential area for reform is in the Church's stance on female priests and married clergy. Some may argue that these changes could help the Church become more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience. However, it's challenging to predict the outcome, as human behavior is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Church's teachings on devotion and commitment are rooted in the idea that priests are married to God. This notion suggests that priests are expected to prioritize their spiritual duties above all else. Nevertheless, the idea that clergy cannot have a family life or personal relationships is not unique to the Church. Many individuals in various professions lead double lives, balancing their professional and personal responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's stance on certain issues and its stance on female priests and married clergy may be contributing to its declining membership. While some may view these stances as outdated, others may see them as essential to the Church's identity. Ultimately, the relationship between the Church and its members is complex and influenced by various factors.",
            "In my opinion, the idea that people's sexual orientation is solely a matter of personal choice is not a stance I subscribe to. I believe that individuals are born with their inherent nature, and it's not something that can be altered through conscious decision-making. This perspective leads me to think that it's unfair to hold people responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize that people's identities are not something they can change at will. For instance, while some individuals are born with a heterosexual inclination, others are born with a same-sex attraction. It's crucial to acknowledge that these are natural variations and not something that can be willfully chosen.\n\nWhen it comes to marriage, I believe that the federal government should not have a say in who individuals can marry. The issue is not a matter of national security or morality; it's a personal matter between two consenting adults. It's not the government's place to dictate who can form a union and who cannot.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people's sexual orientation is not a decision they made, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's essential to respect individuals for who they are and allow them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution.\n\nUltimately, I think it's crucial to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The government should not have the authority to interfere with personal relationships or dictate who can love whom.",
            "The notion of gay marriage legalization has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I firmly believe that this perspective is misguided. Essentially, the two are fundamentally different yet intertwined concepts that cannot be compared directly. The issue is often oversimplified, neglecting the multifaceted aspects that make relationships unique.\n\nOne oft-cited concern is the perceived impact on heterosexual families. However, this argument is based on an oversimplified understanding of the complexities involved. Studies have consistently shown that homosexual couples exhibit similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the fact that homosexual couples are not seeking to obtain a church-sanctioned marriage, but rather a legally recognized union provided by the government. If we separate church and state, the question of moral opposition becomes irrelevant. The provision of a marriage certificate should not be contingent upon the approval of a particular religious group.\n\nIn fact, the lack of equal rights for homosexual couples can be likened to a form of segregation. The notion that they are denied a fundamental right while others enjoy it is a clear infringement on their civil liberties.\n\nConcerns surrounding adoption, community integration, and the impact on children of gay couples are often cited as reasons to oppose gay marriage. However, these concerns are often based on unsubstantiated fears and biases. In reality, children raised by gay parents are not inherently disadvantaged, and their well-being is not predetermined by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nThe phenomenon of bullying and societal pressure faced by children of gay parents is a pressing issue that demands attention and action. Rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes, we should focus on creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.\n\nRegarding the role of government in this issue, I firmly believe that the federal government should play a more proactive role in ensuring the equality of all citizens. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only misguided but also hypocritical, given the government's stance on other issues such as the separation of church and state.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that gay couples are somehow flawed or damaged is a baseless stereotype that has been thoroughly debunked by reputable institutions. By ignoring the scientific consensus and instead relying on anecdotal evidence and personal biases, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and fear. It is time for us to reevaluate our stance on this issue and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One aspect of my summer experience at the hospital pharmacy has led me to consider the multifaceted nature of controlled substances. While certain medications may be prohibited, they continue to demonstrate significant therapeutic potential. In the context of public accessibility, I believe that such substances should not be made readily available. However, their use in medical settings is a different matter. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily negate its benefits.\n\nAs a pharmacy professional, I've seen firsthand the controlled use of substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse. Despite their illicit status, these medications are instrumental in alleviating pain and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, the medicinal properties of marijuana should be acknowledged and respected, rather than being dismissed due to societal stigma.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is not entirely apt, as marijuana's risks are distinct from those associated with excessive drinking. While both substances can be misused, their impacts differ significantly. A more nuanced approach to marijuana regulation would involve a gradual integration into mainstream society, accompanied by education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana is deeply ingrained, largely due to its classification as an illicit substance. However, this image is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of marijuana's risks and benefits. In fact, it's not as hazardous as other Schedule I substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the societal stigma surrounding marijuana, we can begin to view it as a legitimate treatment option, rather than a taboo.\n\nUltimately, a more informed and balanced perspective on marijuana is necessary, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and risks. By doing so, we can work towards a more responsible and evidence-based approach to its use and regulation.",
            "The Catholic Church has undergone significant transformations in recent years to adapt to the changing times. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms. As someone who has been involved with the church their whole life, I've witnessed firsthand the shift towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere. Even within my own experiences, I've noticed a change in the way people dress and engage with the church community.\n\nGrowing up, attending church on Sundays was a regular occurrence, and I would often get dressed up in my finest attire. However, that's no longer the case. The introduction of a shorter Teen Mass has made Sundays more accessible and relaxed, with attendees often wearing casual clothing, even jeans and khakis. This change is particularly noticeable during the warmer months when beachwear is a common sight.\n\nWhile I'm not well-versed in the church's internal politics, one thing is clear: the focus has shifted towards a more casual and welcoming environment. As for the accusations of pedophilia, I believe that these issues are complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I'm not convinced that this would have been the case. Research suggests that pedophilia is a deeply ingrained trait, often rooted in genetics. It's not something that can be easily addressed through changes in the church's policies or practices.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that individuals who are predisposed to pedophilia are unlikely to change their behavior, regardless of their marital status or religious affiliation. While it's essential to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing, I don't believe that the church's policies are to blame for these heinous crimes. Rather, it's the actions of individuals that have caused harm, and it's crucial to address these issues through education, support, and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's evolution towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere is a positive development, but it's essential to separate this from the complex issues surrounding pedophilia. By acknowledging the root causes of these problems and addressing them through a comprehensive approach, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive community for all.",
            "Upon reflection, I have come to realize that the premise we were initially considering had significant implications stemming from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration leveraged a complex series of events and pretexts to justify the invasion of Iraq, which ultimately led to the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, it has since been established that these claims were unfounded.\n\nI strongly believe that the Bush administration's actions and subsequent lack of accountability for these misrepresentations have been particularly egregious. Notably, Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, has since acknowledged his own doubts about the evidence presented at the time of the UN presentation. This demonstrates a disturbing disregard for truth and accountability, which I argue constitutes a serious breach of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions suggest a concerning disregard for the US Constitution and the principles it upholds. Since September 11th, I have witnessed a persistent attempt to marginalize key provisions of the Constitution, which has only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt is my understanding that the younger Bush had a pre-existing agenda to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy, which was motivated in part by his father's past experiences. This agenda may have been driven by a desire to secure access to new energy resources, a goal that is both ambitious and potentially problematic.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the complexities of the situation, I believe that the conflict has endured for far too long. A hasty withdrawal could lead to destabilization and increased bloodshed, potentially plunging the country into civil war. Alternatively, the proposed coalition of regional nations, which includes Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be a viable solution, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create long-term instability.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that the interim government is failing to assert its authority, with the Parliament struggling to establish a cohesive leadership and the Prime Minister lacking control. The influence of radical elements, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, is also contributing to the fractious nature of the political process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I struggle to articulate a clear solution, I firmly believe that the Bush administration's actions have been deeply problematic and that the situation in Iraq remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",
            "Upon reflection, I have mixed feelings regarding the War in Iraq. Initially, I was unsure of where to begin, but it became apparent that a declared war by Congress is a crucial factor in my opinion. Without such a declaration, the conflict seems more like a retaliatory measure in response to the 9/11 attacks. While I don't feel well-versed in the intricacies of the conflict, I understand that our presence in Iraq is aimed at establishing a democratic government and securing resources.\n\nHowever, this approach raises concerns about the feasibility and morality of our involvement. The prolonged duration of the war has led to widespread resentment and instability in the region. Moreover, the difficulty in establishing democracy in a foreign context is a daunting task, and our continued presence may only exacerbate the situation.\n\nOne argument in favor of continuing the war is the concern for the families of service members stationed in Iraq. It is essential to consider the human cost and the impact on the local population. Nevertheless, this perspective is overshadowed by the risk of cultural insensitivity and the potential for our actions to be perceived as an attempt to impose our values on another nation.\n\nA more nuanced approach might be to reevaluate our role in the conflict and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. The ongoing occupation has already led to the growth of extremist groups and increased hostility towards the United States. In light of this, it seems that our continued presence may ultimately be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, the War in Iraq is a complex issue, and my opinion is that it would be beneficial to reassess our involvement and consider a more measured approach. This would allow us to address the root causes of the conflict while minimizing the harm caused to the local population and our own nation.",
            "There are legitimate concerns regarding the government's involvement in declaring something as legal or illegal, particularly when it comes to matters of religious freedom. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it's essential to uphold this principle.\n\nWhen considering the potential for an amendment that restricts certain religious practices, it's crucial to examine the motivations behind this initiative. One must question whether the government is attempting to impose its will on a particular group, rather than allowing for religious tolerance and diversity.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the Constitution since its inception, fostering a culture of religious freedom in the United States. Proposing an amendment that would restrict this freedom would be counterintuitive and contradictory to the founding principles of the nation. Furthermore, such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, which raises significant concerns.\n\nThe government should refrain from intervening in matters of religious practice, as this would be an overreach of authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of religious groups. The president's personal beliefs, as a Catholic, do not provide a sufficient justification for proposing an amendment that discriminates against other faiths. Any decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities directly affected, rather than being imposed by the government.\n\nWhile some may argue that an amendment is necessary to address a perceived issue, a closer examination reveals that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that this amendment would have a positive impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that such an amendment could have unintended consequences, including stifling religious diversity and freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should not be involved in declaring certain religious practices as illegal, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the principles of separation of church and state. The decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities, rather than being imposed by the government.",
            "The Iraq War remains a highly debated topic, with many questioning the motives behind the United States' decision to invade the country in 2003. I firmly believe that the government's initial justifications for the war were not entirely transparent, and that the connection between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that the government played on the emotions of the American people, capitalizing on their outrage following the terrorist attacks of 2001. This led to a lack of critical evaluation of the potential consequences of invading Iraq. As someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was skeptical of the decision from the outset.\n\nThe parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking. Both conflicts involve attempts to impose democracy on foreign nations, often with disastrous results. The removal of the Iraqi government and the subsequent power vacuum led to chaos and instability, which the US was not adequately prepared to handle. This echoes the lessons of Vietnam, where the US struggled to establish a stable government and ultimately withdrew.\n\nThe war has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, with many soldiers continuing to die in a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The US government underestimated the complexity of rebuilding a nation and establishing a functioning democracy. This is a process that requires time, effort, and resources, as exemplified by the struggles our own country faced in its transition to democracy.\n\nMoreover, the US government's decision to invade Iraq raises questions about its motivations. While the stated goal was to promote democracy, many believe that the primary driver was access to Iraq's oil reserves. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, coupled with the fact that the US has not taken similar action against other nations with similar capabilities, such as North Korea, further fuels these suspicions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to go to war in Iraq was likely based on a mix of factors, including a desire to expand US influence and secure access to valuable resources. As the conflict continues to drag on, it is essential to re-evaluate the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was torn between supporting the incumbent, George Bush, and opposing the war. While I initially believed that allowing him to complete his term was the right decision, the ongoing conflict and the continued loss of American lives have made me question this stance. The war has become a protracted and complex issue, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to invest significant resources in the conflict, it is essential to consider the human cost and the potential long-term benefits of a US withdrawal.",
            "I would like to express my support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. My stance on this issue has been consistent throughout my life, and I firmly believe that marriage is a personal preference that should not be dictated by societal norms or external factors.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the possibility that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological factors, rather than solely by societal conditioning. This realization has led me to reconsider the notion that individuals should be denied rights based on their sexual orientation, which is often beyond their control.\n\nI believe that it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marry based on their sexual orientation, and I have always been an advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the role of government and politics should be limited to protecting individual rights, rather than imposing moral or societal values.\n\nIn my community, I have observed that same-sex couples function just like any other family unit, participating in everyday activities and contributing to their communities. It is disconcerting to see politicians attempting to redefine the concept of marriage to suit their own values, rather than respecting the diversity of human relationships.\n\nResearch suggests that sexual orientation may be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than purely by societal upbringing. This understanding has led me to question the notion that same-sex attraction is a choice, and to recognize the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage is a personal matter that should be between the individuals involved, rather than a public or political issue. Just as individuals are free to get married without public fanfare, same-sex couples should have the same right to enter into a committed partnership without fear of public scrutiny or judgment.",
            "There are certain expectations that come with posting content online. Once something is published on the internet, it becomes a public forum that anyone can access. As someone who has experience with this in a residential setting, I can attest to the fact that online activities can significantly impact how people perceive individuals.\n\nWhen discussing sensitive topics such as violence or threats, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of sharing them online. What may seem like a joke or a harmless comment to the poster can be misconstrued by others, potentially leading to serious repercussions.\n\nIn a school setting, if a student posts something alarming, it's not uncommon for school officials to investigate the situation further. This is often done to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff. While it's essential to respect students' online privacy, there are instances where school administrators may need to intervene.\n\nFor example, if a student posts something that raises concerns about their mental health or intentions, it's the school's responsibility to address the situation. This can be done without infringing on the student's privacy, as the information was shared publicly. However, it's also crucial to note that not all online activity warrants intervention.\n\nSchool officials should not engage in excessive monitoring of students' online activities, such as friending them on social media or tracking their phone conversations. If concerns are brought to their attention, it's essential to handle them in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nA similar principle applies to residential advisors like myself. While it's not necessary to be friends with residents on social media, we must be prepared to address any issues that arise from their online activity. This can be a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that once something is posted online, it's accessible to a wide audience. If you don't want certain information to be shared or don't want people to form a particular opinion about you, it's best to exercise caution when posting online.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its original purpose. Initially, the intention was to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, a goal that I believe is noble. However, over time, I fear that the primary motivation has shifted from a desire to promote democracy to a demonstration of military prowess.\n\nLooking back, I think the initial invasion was a powerful statement in itself, sending a clear message about our commitment to democracy. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict has raised concerns about the true reasons behind our involvement. If the primary objective was to establish democracy, it's likely that our efforts would have been more focused and decisive. Instead, it appears that we have become bogged down in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.\n\nIn my opinion, our original motivation was admirable, but it has been compromised by personal and ulterior motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. This has led to a war that has become increasingly complex and difficult to justify.\n\nI believe that we have already achieved a significant portion of our goals in the initial stages of the conflict. It's time to reassess our priorities and acknowledge that our continued involvement is no longer justifiable. The war has drained our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. As a result, I strongly believe that it's time to bring our troops home and allow the country to take ownership of its future.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that war should not be a long-term expenditure in our budget. We have pressing domestic concerns that require attention and funding, such as maintaining public roads, improving education, and providing quality healthcare. The financial burdens of this war have come at a high cost, including the loss of American lives and the erosion of our national funds. It's time for a change in direction and a renewed focus on our own nation's needs.",
            "The question of balancing online privacy with potential consequences is a complex one. If an individual shares personal information on a social networking site, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, users must accept friend requests from others to view their profiles, thereby granting permission to access their content. This understanding is crucial when contributing to online communities.\n\nHowever, the idea of monitoring students' online profiles to prevent potential harm raises concerns. While it may be possible for someone to stumble upon potentially problematic information, it's impractical and potentially discriminatory to have someone dedicated to scrutinizing individual profiles. The decision to monitor should be based on specific circumstances, such as evidence of suspicious behavior, rather than a general policy.\n\nMy personal experience with social media has taught me to be cautious about sharing personal information. Although I don't maintain a Myspace profile, I do have a Facebook account, and I'm aware of the risks associated with online interactions. A documentary I watched highlighted the ease with which an individual can gather information from social media profiles, which can be used to manipulate others. This has led me to limit the information I share online, while still allowing me to maintain connections with friends.\n\nHowever, I've also come to realize that it's difficult to control who has access to our online presence. Even with privacy settings in place, there's still a risk that others can view our information. This is why I'm careful about accepting friend requests and limit the amount of personal data I share.\n\nA recent conversation with my roommate about her high school experience shed light on the issue of school administrators banning students from using Myspace. While I'm not entirely sure about the reasoning behind this decision, it did raise questions about the extent of authority schools have over students' online activities.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between online privacy and potential consequences is a delicate one. While it's essential to be mindful of the information we share online, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of blanket policies aimed at monitoring students' online activities.",
            "The Iraq War has been a highly debated topic, with various perspectives emerging over time. Initially, many people, including myself, expressed opposition to the invasion. However, as the situation has evolved, the general consensus worldwide has shifted towards viewing the war as a regrettable decision. This is evident in the overwhelming majority of global polls, which suggest that approximately 75-80% of the international community, including a significant percentage of Iraqi citizens and US troops stationed in Iraq, consider the war to have been a mistake.\n\nThe complexities of the Middle East and the cultural differences between Western and Middle Eastern societies can make it challenging to implement successful democratic reforms. The notion that a foreign power can impose its values and governance structures on a region with a distinct history and cultural identity is a notion that has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly problematic, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking military action, particularly when the outcome is uncertain. The rapid escalation of the situation has led to a prolonged and arduous conflict, with numerous challenges and obstacles hindering a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering the prevailing sentiment among the Iraqi population and the international community, it is worth considering the possibility of a gradual withdrawal of US forces over the course of a year or more. This approach would allow for a more measured exit strategy while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences. Notably, a significant portion of Iraqis advocate for an immediate withdrawal, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the current presence.\n\nThe notion that the Iraqi people's decisions should be taken into account is a valid one. If they are telling us to leave, it is essential to consider their perspective and assess the situation objectively. Ultimately, if we were to withdraw and the situation were to deteriorate, we could argue that we had given the Iraqi people the opportunity to make their own decisions and that any negative outcomes would be a result of their choices, not ours.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War has been a multifaceted and intricate issue, with various stakeholders holding different views on its legitimacy and effectiveness. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it seems that a gradual withdrawal of US forces, potentially followed by international assistance, could be a more viable and responsible approach.",
            "One of the most pressing issues in the United States today is the persistence of gender discrimination. While progress has been made in recent years, it remains a significant hurdle in various industries. I firmly believe that societal attitudes and expectations play a substantial role in perpetuating this issue. For instance, in the corporate world, women often face barriers to advancement due to the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where despite having the necessary qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions in favor of male candidates.\n\nThis is not to say that men are immune to discrimination; on the contrary, they too can face difficulties in fields such as fashion, where traditional stereotypes can make it challenging for men to be taken seriously. The notion that men who are interested in fashion are somehow less masculine or less capable can be a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations around caregiving roles can also perpetuate gender discrimination. The stigma surrounding men who stay at home to care for their children is still prevalent, with many people viewing it as unconventional or even unnatural. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for stay-at-home dads, who are often judged for prioritizing family responsibilities over professional ambitions.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where traditional gender roles can be limiting. Men who work in fashion may be subject to skepticism simply because of their gender, with some people questioning their understanding of the industry.\n\nHowever, there are signs that attitudes are slowly shifting. As more women take on leadership roles and break down barriers in the corporate world, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, it is becoming clearer that traditional gender roles are no longer the only standard. By promoting the qualities and achievements of individuals who deviate from these norms, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that discrimination can take many forms, and individuals from different backgrounds may face unique challenges. For example, someone from a rural area may face bias due to their accent or lack of formal education, despite being intelligent and capable. Similarly, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may face prejudice based on their language or customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in addressing gender discrimination in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and working towards greater understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.",
            "My understanding is that while marijuana has not been fully legalized, it has undergone decriminalization, which has downgraded it from a criminal offense to a more akin to a traffic citation. This change involves a less severe outcome, such as receiving a fine rather than facing arrest, booking, and prosecution. Consequently, individuals cited for marijuana possession or use may face fewer consequences in the long run, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications, which can be detrimental to one's future.\n\nHowever, there are varying perspectives on the matter. On one hand, decriminalization can be economically advantageous for municipalities, as it reduces the costs associated with law enforcement, court proceedings, and public defense. This can be a significant concern for financially strained cities, making it a difficult decision to make. In contrast, some communities may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to philosophical or cultural opposition to marijuana.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, has taken a different approach, and it appears to have benefited from the change. As a result, they have redirected funds toward public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. This shift is a significant step forward, especially considering the economic constraints that many municipalities face.\n\nIt is essential to consider the potential consequences of full legalization, as it could lead to increased availability and visibility of marijuana. This might result in a rise in smoking-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. Moreover, societal norms and stigma surrounding marijuana use still exist, making it a sensitive topic in many contexts.\n\nInterestingly, while marijuana's effects on motor skills are not as pronounced as those of alcohol, its impact on lifestyle can be more profound for some individuals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that people react differently to substances, and personal characteristics, such as moderation and self-control, play a significant role in determining the outcome. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, making it challenging to generalize their impact on individuals.",
            "I believe that the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the institution has a rich history and a set of guiding principles that have been upheld for centuries. However, this steadfast commitment to tradition can sometimes make it difficult for the Church to adapt to changing times and circumstances.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this dilemma is the Church's stance on interfaith marriage. My own family's experience with this issue serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of a rigid adherence to doctrine. My parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in the Catholic Church because of the Church's refusal to accept my father's Episcopalian faith.\n\nThis experience has led me to wonder whether the Church's doctrine of love and acceptance can be reconciled with its practice of excluding those who do not conform to its norms. While the Catholic Church teaches that love and acceptance are fundamental principles, its actions often suggest a more limited and exclusive approach. This tension between theory and practice can be a source of frustration and disillusionment, particularly for those who seek a more inclusive and compassionate faith.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I share the view that it would not necessarily address the root causes of pedophilia within the Church. As I see it, the decision to engage in such behavior is a choice that is not directly related to marital status. In fact, my understanding is that individuals who are capable of such actions are likely to continue doing so regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition is an essential aspect of the Catholic Church, it must be balanced with a willingness to adapt and evolve. The Church's rigid stance on certain issues can sometimes hinder its ability to live up to its core values of love and acceptance. As the Church continues to navigate the complexities of modern society, it is essential that it find a way to reconcile its tradition with its practice, creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all its members.",
            "In this contentious issue, I find myself grappling with a certain degree of ambivalence. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I hesitate to take a definitive stance, as it's a complex problem that has sparked intense debate and emotional attachment. The delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage is indeed a challenging one to navigate without inadvertently offending certain groups.\n\nOne potential solution could be to reevaluate the way we approach marriage, considering it as a civil union rather than a sacrament. This perspective acknowledges the government's role in recognizing and providing benefits to couples, without imposing its own values or interpretations. By doing so, we can avoid blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the distinction between marriage and civil unions becomes more nuanced. It's possible that the government's recognition of marriage as a civil union could be more inclusive, rather than a label imposed by a specific institution. This thought process also raises questions about the role of the government in defining what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage.\n\nIn the context of same-sex marriage, I believe that a civil union approach could provide a more neutral and inclusive framework. It allows the government to acknowledge the union of two consenting adults without imposing its own moral or religious values. Ultimately, the decision to redefine marriage is a matter of personal conviction, but it's essential to approach it with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it's reasonable to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage seems premature and unnecessary. The Constitution should be amended to address matters of significant national import, rather than issues that, while contentious, don't warrant such drastic action.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and civil unions requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. By reexamining our assumptions and considering the role of the government in defining marriage, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding that respects the diversity of individual perspectives.",
            "As someone with a Christian upbringing, I've always navigated the topic of homosexuality with a nuanced perspective. Having many close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to form a deeper understanding of their experiences and the complexities surrounding the issue. While I don't feel entirely in alignment with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle myself, I firmly believe in the importance of equality and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the individual states, rather than be dictated by federal law. This approach acknowledges the diversity of opinions and values across different regions, allowing each state to make decisions that reflect the unique needs and concerns of its citizens. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals are free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nI'm aware that some states lean Democratic and others Republican, and it's not surprising that Democratic states tend to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. However, I believe that individuals who choose to reside in a particular state have a responsibility to respect the values and laws that govern their community. By leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the states, we're allowing local leaders to make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being and happiness of their constituents.\n\nIn the case of former President Bush's stance on gay marriage, I disagree with his efforts to impose a national ban. As the President of the United States, he had a unique platform to shape the country's policies, but I don't believe that his opinions should supersede the autonomy of individual states. In fact, his impending departure from office highlights the impermanence of federal decisions and the importance of allowing states to chart their own course.\n\nUltimately, I believe that certain issues, like same-sex marriage, should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach recognizes the complexity of the issue and the varying values of different communities. By empowering states to make their own decisions, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination.",
            "The concept of Myspace as a public platform is often misunderstood. Upon reflection, it's clear that anything posted online can be accessed by anyone. This includes school officials, who may be checking for potential security threats, such as students engaging in substance use or other prohibited behaviors.\n\nWhile one may feel uncomfortable with the idea of school officials monitoring online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students. In this context, online monitoring can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent incidents like school shootings.\n\nThe idea that school officials might access Myspace profiles outside of their official capacity is also relevant. Even if a student doesn't explicitly state they're associated with the school, their profile can still be discovered through various means, including their home internet connections. \n\nSchool officials may use social media to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. This proactive approach can help prevent problems and make the school a safer place. In fact, many schools have implemented various safety protocols, such as lockdown drills, to prepare for potential threats.\n\nIn the case of the Myspace monitoring, the school officials' actions can be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure student safety. While it may seem invasive, their primary goal is to prevent harm and create a secure environment for all students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a way of holding onto information, making it difficult to erase past online activity. This highlights the importance of being mindful of one's online presence and the potential consequences of posting sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, while school officials may seem overzealous in their monitoring, their actions are ultimately aimed at creating a safer environment for students. This may involve accessing social media platforms like Myspace to identify potential issues and prevent harm.",
            "The invasion of Iraq was a decision that I initially supported, largely driven by the personal impact of 9/11 on my life. However, as I reflected further on the situation, I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional response to the attacks led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the potential outcomes of our involvement.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that we entered the conflict without a clear plan for the post-invasion period, which led to unforeseen challenges and setbacks. I think that our initial motivations were driven more by a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The President's decision to declare war on Iraq, while understandable in the context of the time, was also driven by public opinion and a desire for action.\n\nLooking back, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of imposing our will on a country with such a different cultural and historical context. The concept of war is perceived very differently in Iraq than it is in the US, and our actions were often viewed as an invasion rather than a liberation.\n\nI now believe that our presence in Iraq has not brought about the desired outcome and may have even exacerbated the situation. The ongoing conflict has highlighted the challenges of nation-building and the difficulty of imposing democratic values on a country with a different cultural identity. I think that we should have been more cautious in our approach and considered the long-term implications of our actions.\n\nWhile we have made some progress in Iraq, I believe that our continued presence is not sufficient to achieve lasting stability. I think that our involvement has actually hindered our own interests and that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region. Ultimately, I believe that the people of Iraq must take ownership of their country's future, and we should focus on supporting their efforts rather than trying to impose our will on them.\n\nI also believe that our initial motivations and actions were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a genuine desire to help the Iraqi people. Our actions were seen as an attempt to impose our values and way of life on a country that was not ready or willing to accept them. I think that this approach was misguided and has ultimately led to more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I initially supported the invasion of Iraq, I now believe that it was a mistake. Our actions were driven by emotion rather than careful planning and consideration, and our continued presence has not brought about the desired outcome. I think that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region and focus on supporting the people of Iraq rather than trying to impose our will on them."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church's views on certain issues may be contributing to its declining membership. While it's natural for institutions to hold strong convictions, their stance on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control may be perceived as outdated by some. This perceived rigidity can lead individuals to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable within the Church.\n\nFor instance, when a person holds a different viewpoint on abortion or gay marriage, they may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and potentially even alienate individuals from the faith. Essentially, the Church's stance on these issues may be driving people away.\n\nOne potential area for reform is in the Church's stance on female priests and married clergy. Some may argue that these changes could help the Church become more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience. However, it's challenging to predict the outcome, as human behavior is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Church's teachings on devotion and commitment are rooted in the idea that priests are married to God. This notion suggests that priests are expected to prioritize their spiritual duties above all else. Nevertheless, the idea that clergy cannot have a family life or personal relationships is not unique to the Church. Many individuals in various professions lead double lives, balancing their professional and personal responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's stance on certain issues and its stance on female priests and married clergy may be contributing to its declining membership. While some may view these stances as outdated, others may see them as essential to the Church's identity. Ultimately, the relationship between the Church and its members is complex and influenced by various factors.",
            "In my opinion, the idea that people's sexual orientation is solely a matter of personal choice is not a stance I subscribe to. I believe that individuals are born with their inherent nature, and it's not something that can be altered through conscious decision-making. This perspective leads me to think that it's unfair to hold people responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize that people's identities are not something they can change at will. For instance, while some individuals are born with a heterosexual inclination, others are born with a same-sex attraction. It's crucial to acknowledge that these are natural variations and not something that can be willfully chosen.\n\nWhen it comes to marriage, I believe that the federal government should not have a say in who individuals can marry. The issue is not a matter of national security or morality; it's a personal matter between two consenting adults. It's not the government's place to dictate who can form a union and who cannot.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people's sexual orientation is not a decision they made, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's essential to respect individuals for who they are and allow them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution.\n\nUltimately, I think it's crucial to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The government should not have the authority to interfere with personal relationships or dictate who can love whom.",
            "The notion of gay marriage legalization has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I firmly believe that this perspective is misguided. Essentially, the two are fundamentally different yet intertwined concepts that cannot be compared directly. The issue is often oversimplified, neglecting the multifaceted aspects that make relationships unique.\n\nOne oft-cited concern is the perceived impact on heterosexual families. However, this argument is based on an oversimplified understanding of the complexities involved. Studies have consistently shown that homosexual couples exhibit similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the fact that homosexual couples are not seeking to obtain a church-sanctioned marriage, but rather a legally recognized union provided by the government. If we separate church and state, the question of moral opposition becomes irrelevant. The provision of a marriage certificate should not be contingent upon the approval of a particular religious group.\n\nIn fact, the lack of equal rights for homosexual couples can be likened to a form of segregation. The notion that they are denied a fundamental right while others enjoy it is a clear infringement on their civil liberties.\n\nConcerns surrounding adoption, community integration, and the impact on children of gay couples are often cited as reasons to oppose gay marriage. However, these concerns are often based on unsubstantiated fears and biases. In reality, children raised by gay parents are not inherently disadvantaged, and their well-being is not predetermined by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nThe phenomenon of bullying and societal pressure faced by children of gay parents is a pressing issue that demands attention and action. Rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes, we should focus on creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.\n\nRegarding the role of government in this issue, I firmly believe that the federal government should play a more proactive role in ensuring the equality of all citizens. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only misguided but also hypocritical, given the government's stance on other issues such as the separation of church and state.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that gay couples are somehow flawed or damaged is a baseless stereotype that has been thoroughly debunked by reputable institutions. By ignoring the scientific consensus and instead relying on anecdotal evidence and personal biases, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and fear. It is time for us to reevaluate our stance on this issue and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One aspect of my summer experience at the hospital pharmacy has led me to consider the multifaceted nature of controlled substances. While certain medications may be prohibited, they continue to demonstrate significant therapeutic potential. In the context of public accessibility, I believe that such substances should not be made readily available. However, their use in medical settings is a different matter. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily negate its benefits.\n\nAs a pharmacy professional, I've seen firsthand the controlled use of substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse. Despite their illicit status, these medications are instrumental in alleviating pain and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, the medicinal properties of marijuana should be acknowledged and respected, rather than being dismissed due to societal stigma.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is not entirely apt, as marijuana's risks are distinct from those associated with excessive drinking. While both substances can be misused, their impacts differ significantly. A more nuanced approach to marijuana regulation would involve a gradual integration into mainstream society, accompanied by education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana is deeply ingrained, largely due to its classification as an illicit substance. However, this image is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of marijuana's risks and benefits. In fact, it's not as hazardous as other Schedule I substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the societal stigma surrounding marijuana, we can begin to view it as a legitimate treatment option, rather than a taboo.\n\nUltimately, a more informed and balanced perspective on marijuana is necessary, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and risks. By doing so, we can work towards a more responsible and evidence-based approach to its use and regulation.",
            "The Catholic Church has undergone significant transformations in recent years to adapt to the changing times. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms. As someone who has been involved with the church their whole life, I've witnessed firsthand the shift towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere. Even within my own experiences, I've noticed a change in the way people dress and engage with the church community.\n\nGrowing up, attending church on Sundays was a regular occurrence, and I would often get dressed up in my finest attire. However, that's no longer the case. The introduction of a shorter Teen Mass has made Sundays more accessible and relaxed, with attendees often wearing casual clothing, even jeans and khakis. This change is particularly noticeable during the warmer months when beachwear is a common sight.\n\nWhile I'm not well-versed in the church's internal politics, one thing is clear: the focus has shifted towards a more casual and welcoming environment. As for the accusations of pedophilia, I believe that these issues are complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I'm not convinced that this would have been the case. Research suggests that pedophilia is a deeply ingrained trait, often rooted in genetics. It's not something that can be easily addressed through changes in the church's policies or practices.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that individuals who are predisposed to pedophilia are unlikely to change their behavior, regardless of their marital status or religious affiliation. While it's essential to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing, I don't believe that the church's policies are to blame for these heinous crimes. Rather, it's the actions of individuals that have caused harm, and it's crucial to address these issues through education, support, and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's evolution towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere is a positive development, but it's essential to separate this from the complex issues surrounding pedophilia. By acknowledging the root causes of these problems and addressing them through a comprehensive approach, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive community for all.",
            "Upon reflection, I have come to realize that the premise we were initially considering had significant implications stemming from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration leveraged a complex series of events and pretexts to justify the invasion of Iraq, which ultimately led to the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, it has since been established that these claims were unfounded.\n\nI strongly believe that the Bush administration's actions and subsequent lack of accountability for these misrepresentations have been particularly egregious. Notably, Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, has since acknowledged his own doubts about the evidence presented at the time of the UN presentation. This demonstrates a disturbing disregard for truth and accountability, which I argue constitutes a serious breach of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions suggest a concerning disregard for the US Constitution and the principles it upholds. Since September 11th, I have witnessed a persistent attempt to marginalize key provisions of the Constitution, which has only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt is my understanding that the younger Bush had a pre-existing agenda to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy, which was motivated in part by his father's past experiences. This agenda may have been driven by a desire to secure access to new energy resources, a goal that is both ambitious and potentially problematic.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the complexities of the situation, I believe that the conflict has endured for far too long. A hasty withdrawal could lead to destabilization and increased bloodshed, potentially plunging the country into civil war. Alternatively, the proposed coalition of regional nations, which includes Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be a viable solution, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create long-term instability.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that the interim government is failing to assert its authority, with the Parliament struggling to establish a cohesive leadership and the Prime Minister lacking control. The influence of radical elements, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, is also contributing to the fractious nature of the political process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I struggle to articulate a clear solution, I firmly believe that the Bush administration's actions have been deeply problematic and that the situation in Iraq remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",
            "Upon reflection, I have mixed feelings regarding the War in Iraq. Initially, I was unsure of where to begin, but it became apparent that a declared war by Congress is a crucial factor in my opinion. Without such a declaration, the conflict seems more like a retaliatory measure in response to the 9/11 attacks. While I don't feel well-versed in the intricacies of the conflict, I understand that our presence in Iraq is aimed at establishing a democratic government and securing resources.\n\nHowever, this approach raises concerns about the feasibility and morality of our involvement. The prolonged duration of the war has led to widespread resentment and instability in the region. Moreover, the difficulty in establishing democracy in a foreign context is a daunting task, and our continued presence may only exacerbate the situation.\n\nOne argument in favor of continuing the war is the concern for the families of service members stationed in Iraq. It is essential to consider the human cost and the impact on the local population. Nevertheless, this perspective is overshadowed by the risk of cultural insensitivity and the potential for our actions to be perceived as an attempt to impose our values on another nation.\n\nA more nuanced approach might be to reevaluate our role in the conflict and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. The ongoing occupation has already led to the growth of extremist groups and increased hostility towards the United States. In light of this, it seems that our continued presence may ultimately be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, the War in Iraq is a complex issue, and my opinion is that it would be beneficial to reassess our involvement and consider a more measured approach. This would allow us to address the root causes of the conflict while minimizing the harm caused to the local population and our own nation.",
            "There are legitimate concerns regarding the government's involvement in declaring something as legal or illegal, particularly when it comes to matters of religious freedom. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it's essential to uphold this principle.\n\nWhen considering the potential for an amendment that restricts certain religious practices, it's crucial to examine the motivations behind this initiative. One must question whether the government is attempting to impose its will on a particular group, rather than allowing for religious tolerance and diversity.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the Constitution since its inception, fostering a culture of religious freedom in the United States. Proposing an amendment that would restrict this freedom would be counterintuitive and contradictory to the founding principles of the nation. Furthermore, such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, which raises significant concerns.\n\nThe government should refrain from intervening in matters of religious practice, as this would be an overreach of authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of religious groups. The president's personal beliefs, as a Catholic, do not provide a sufficient justification for proposing an amendment that discriminates against other faiths. Any decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities directly affected, rather than being imposed by the government.\n\nWhile some may argue that an amendment is necessary to address a perceived issue, a closer examination reveals that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that this amendment would have a positive impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that such an amendment could have unintended consequences, including stifling religious diversity and freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should not be involved in declaring certain religious practices as illegal, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the principles of separation of church and state. The decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities, rather than being imposed by the government.",
            "The Iraq War remains a highly debated topic, with many questioning the motives behind the United States' decision to invade the country in 2003. I firmly believe that the government's initial justifications for the war were not entirely transparent, and that the connection between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that the government played on the emotions of the American people, capitalizing on their outrage following the terrorist attacks of 2001. This led to a lack of critical evaluation of the potential consequences of invading Iraq. As someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was skeptical of the decision from the outset.\n\nThe parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking. Both conflicts involve attempts to impose democracy on foreign nations, often with disastrous results. The removal of the Iraqi government and the subsequent power vacuum led to chaos and instability, which the US was not adequately prepared to handle. This echoes the lessons of Vietnam, where the US struggled to establish a stable government and ultimately withdrew.\n\nThe war has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, with many soldiers continuing to die in a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The US government underestimated the complexity of rebuilding a nation and establishing a functioning democracy. This is a process that requires time, effort, and resources, as exemplified by the struggles our own country faced in its transition to democracy.\n\nMoreover, the US government's decision to invade Iraq raises questions about its motivations. While the stated goal was to promote democracy, many believe that the primary driver was access to Iraq's oil reserves. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, coupled with the fact that the US has not taken similar action against other nations with similar capabilities, such as North Korea, further fuels these suspicions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to go to war in Iraq was likely based on a mix of factors, including a desire to expand US influence and secure access to valuable resources. As the conflict continues to drag on, it is essential to re-evaluate the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was torn between supporting the incumbent, George Bush, and opposing the war. While I initially believed that allowing him to complete his term was the right decision, the ongoing conflict and the continued loss of American lives have made me question this stance. The war has become a protracted and complex issue, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to invest significant resources in the conflict, it is essential to consider the human cost and the potential long-term benefits of a US withdrawal.",
            "I would like to express my support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. My stance on this issue has been consistent throughout my life, and I firmly believe that marriage is a personal preference that should not be dictated by societal norms or external factors.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the possibility that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological factors, rather than solely by societal conditioning. This realization has led me to reconsider the notion that individuals should be denied rights based on their sexual orientation, which is often beyond their control.\n\nI believe that it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marry based on their sexual orientation, and I have always been an advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the role of government and politics should be limited to protecting individual rights, rather than imposing moral or societal values.\n\nIn my community, I have observed that same-sex couples function just like any other family unit, participating in everyday activities and contributing to their communities. It is disconcerting to see politicians attempting to redefine the concept of marriage to suit their own values, rather than respecting the diversity of human relationships.\n\nResearch suggests that sexual orientation may be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than purely by societal upbringing. This understanding has led me to question the notion that same-sex attraction is a choice, and to recognize the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage is a personal matter that should be between the individuals involved, rather than a public or political issue. Just as individuals are free to get married without public fanfare, same-sex couples should have the same right to enter into a committed partnership without fear of public scrutiny or judgment.",
            "There are certain expectations that come with posting content online. Once something is published on the internet, it becomes a public forum that anyone can access. As someone who has experience with this in a residential setting, I can attest to the fact that online activities can significantly impact how people perceive individuals.\n\nWhen discussing sensitive topics such as violence or threats, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of sharing them online. What may seem like a joke or a harmless comment to the poster can be misconstrued by others, potentially leading to serious repercussions.\n\nIn a school setting, if a student posts something alarming, it's not uncommon for school officials to investigate the situation further. This is often done to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff. While it's essential to respect students' online privacy, there are instances where school administrators may need to intervene.\n\nFor example, if a student posts something that raises concerns about their mental health or intentions, it's the school's responsibility to address the situation. This can be done without infringing on the student's privacy, as the information was shared publicly. However, it's also crucial to note that not all online activity warrants intervention.\n\nSchool officials should not engage in excessive monitoring of students' online activities, such as friending them on social media or tracking their phone conversations. If concerns are brought to their attention, it's essential to handle them in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nA similar principle applies to residential advisors like myself. While it's not necessary to be friends with residents on social media, we must be prepared to address any issues that arise from their online activity. This can be a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that once something is posted online, it's accessible to a wide audience. If you don't want certain information to be shared or don't want people to form a particular opinion about you, it's best to exercise caution when posting online.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its original purpose. Initially, the intention was to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, a goal that I believe is noble. However, over time, I fear that the primary motivation has shifted from a desire to promote democracy to a demonstration of military prowess.\n\nLooking back, I think the initial invasion was a powerful statement in itself, sending a clear message about our commitment to democracy. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict has raised concerns about the true reasons behind our involvement. If the primary objective was to establish democracy, it's likely that our efforts would have been more focused and decisive. Instead, it appears that we have become bogged down in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.\n\nIn my opinion, our original motivation was admirable, but it has been compromised by personal and ulterior motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. This has led to a war that has become increasingly complex and difficult to justify.\n\nI believe that we have already achieved a significant portion of our goals in the initial stages of the conflict. It's time to reassess our priorities and acknowledge that our continued involvement is no longer justifiable. The war has drained our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. As a result, I strongly believe that it's time to bring our troops home and allow the country to take ownership of its future.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that war should not be a long-term expenditure in our budget. We have pressing domestic concerns that require attention and funding, such as maintaining public roads, improving education, and providing quality healthcare. The financial burdens of this war have come at a high cost, including the loss of American lives and the erosion of our national funds. It's time for a change in direction and a renewed focus on our own nation's needs.",
            "The question of balancing online privacy with potential consequences is a complex one. If an individual shares personal information on a social networking site, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, users must accept friend requests from others to view their profiles, thereby granting permission to access their content. This understanding is crucial when contributing to online communities.\n\nHowever, the idea of monitoring students' online profiles to prevent potential harm raises concerns. While it may be possible for someone to stumble upon potentially problematic information, it's impractical and potentially discriminatory to have someone dedicated to scrutinizing individual profiles. The decision to monitor should be based on specific circumstances, such as evidence of suspicious behavior, rather than a general policy.\n\nMy personal experience with social media has taught me to be cautious about sharing personal information. Although I don't maintain a Myspace profile, I do have a Facebook account, and I'm aware of the risks associated with online interactions. A documentary I watched highlighted the ease with which an individual can gather information from social media profiles, which can be used to manipulate others. This has led me to limit the information I share online, while still allowing me to maintain connections with friends.\n\nHowever, I've also come to realize that it's difficult to control who has access to our online presence. Even with privacy settings in place, there's still a risk that others can view our information. This is why I'm careful about accepting friend requests and limit the amount of personal data I share.\n\nA recent conversation with my roommate about her high school experience shed light on the issue of school administrators banning students from using Myspace. While I'm not entirely sure about the reasoning behind this decision, it did raise questions about the extent of authority schools have over students' online activities.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between online privacy and potential consequences is a delicate one. While it's essential to be mindful of the information we share online, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of blanket policies aimed at monitoring students' online activities.",
            "The Iraq War has been a highly debated topic, with various perspectives emerging over time. Initially, many people, including myself, expressed opposition to the invasion. However, as the situation has evolved, the general consensus worldwide has shifted towards viewing the war as a regrettable decision. This is evident in the overwhelming majority of global polls, which suggest that approximately 75-80% of the international community, including a significant percentage of Iraqi citizens and US troops stationed in Iraq, consider the war to have been a mistake.\n\nThe complexities of the Middle East and the cultural differences between Western and Middle Eastern societies can make it challenging to implement successful democratic reforms. The notion that a foreign power can impose its values and governance structures on a region with a distinct history and cultural identity is a notion that has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly problematic, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking military action, particularly when the outcome is uncertain. The rapid escalation of the situation has led to a prolonged and arduous conflict, with numerous challenges and obstacles hindering a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering the prevailing sentiment among the Iraqi population and the international community, it is worth considering the possibility of a gradual withdrawal of US forces over the course of a year or more. This approach would allow for a more measured exit strategy while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences. Notably, a significant portion of Iraqis advocate for an immediate withdrawal, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the current presence.\n\nThe notion that the Iraqi people's decisions should be taken into account is a valid one. If they are telling us to leave, it is essential to consider their perspective and assess the situation objectively. Ultimately, if we were to withdraw and the situation were to deteriorate, we could argue that we had given the Iraqi people the opportunity to make their own decisions and that any negative outcomes would be a result of their choices, not ours.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War has been a multifaceted and intricate issue, with various stakeholders holding different views on its legitimacy and effectiveness. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it seems that a gradual withdrawal of US forces, potentially followed by international assistance, could be a more viable and responsible approach.",
            "One of the most pressing issues in the United States today is the persistence of gender discrimination. While progress has been made in recent years, it remains a significant hurdle in various industries. I firmly believe that societal attitudes and expectations play a substantial role in perpetuating this issue. For instance, in the corporate world, women often face barriers to advancement due to the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where despite having the necessary qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions in favor of male candidates.\n\nThis is not to say that men are immune to discrimination; on the contrary, they too can face difficulties in fields such as fashion, where traditional stereotypes can make it challenging for men to be taken seriously. The notion that men who are interested in fashion are somehow less masculine or less capable can be a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations around caregiving roles can also perpetuate gender discrimination. The stigma surrounding men who stay at home to care for their children is still prevalent, with many people viewing it as unconventional or even unnatural. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for stay-at-home dads, who are often judged for prioritizing family responsibilities over professional ambitions.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where traditional gender roles can be limiting. Men who work in fashion may be subject to skepticism simply because of their gender, with some people questioning their understanding of the industry.\n\nHowever, there are signs that attitudes are slowly shifting. As more women take on leadership roles and break down barriers in the corporate world, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, it is becoming clearer that traditional gender roles are no longer the only standard. By promoting the qualities and achievements of individuals who deviate from these norms, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that discrimination can take many forms, and individuals from different backgrounds may face unique challenges. For example, someone from a rural area may face bias due to their accent or lack of formal education, despite being intelligent and capable. Similarly, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may face prejudice based on their language or customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in addressing gender discrimination in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and working towards greater understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.",
            "My understanding is that while marijuana has not been fully legalized, it has undergone decriminalization, which has downgraded it from a criminal offense to a more akin to a traffic citation. This change involves a less severe outcome, such as receiving a fine rather than facing arrest, booking, and prosecution. Consequently, individuals cited for marijuana possession or use may face fewer consequences in the long run, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications, which can be detrimental to one's future.\n\nHowever, there are varying perspectives on the matter. On one hand, decriminalization can be economically advantageous for municipalities, as it reduces the costs associated with law enforcement, court proceedings, and public defense. This can be a significant concern for financially strained cities, making it a difficult decision to make. In contrast, some communities may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to philosophical or cultural opposition to marijuana.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, has taken a different approach, and it appears to have benefited from the change. As a result, they have redirected funds toward public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. This shift is a significant step forward, especially considering the economic constraints that many municipalities face.\n\nIt is essential to consider the potential consequences of full legalization, as it could lead to increased availability and visibility of marijuana. This might result in a rise in smoking-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. Moreover, societal norms and stigma surrounding marijuana use still exist, making it a sensitive topic in many contexts.\n\nInterestingly, while marijuana's effects on motor skills are not as pronounced as those of alcohol, its impact on lifestyle can be more profound for some individuals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that people react differently to substances, and personal characteristics, such as moderation and self-control, play a significant role in determining the outcome. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, making it challenging to generalize their impact on individuals.",
            "I believe that the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the institution has a rich history and a set of guiding principles that have been upheld for centuries. However, this steadfast commitment to tradition can sometimes make it difficult for the Church to adapt to changing times and circumstances.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this dilemma is the Church's stance on interfaith marriage. My own family's experience with this issue serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of a rigid adherence to doctrine. My parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in the Catholic Church because of the Church's refusal to accept my father's Episcopalian faith.\n\nThis experience has led me to wonder whether the Church's doctrine of love and acceptance can be reconciled with its practice of excluding those who do not conform to its norms. While the Catholic Church teaches that love and acceptance are fundamental principles, its actions often suggest a more limited and exclusive approach. This tension between theory and practice can be a source of frustration and disillusionment, particularly for those who seek a more inclusive and compassionate faith.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I share the view that it would not necessarily address the root causes of pedophilia within the Church. As I see it, the decision to engage in such behavior is a choice that is not directly related to marital status. In fact, my understanding is that individuals who are capable of such actions are likely to continue doing so regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition is an essential aspect of the Catholic Church, it must be balanced with a willingness to adapt and evolve. The Church's rigid stance on certain issues can sometimes hinder its ability to live up to its core values of love and acceptance. As the Church continues to navigate the complexities of modern society, it is essential that it find a way to reconcile its tradition with its practice, creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all its members.",
            "In this contentious issue, I find myself grappling with a certain degree of ambivalence. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I hesitate to take a definitive stance, as it's a complex problem that has sparked intense debate and emotional attachment. The delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage is indeed a challenging one to navigate without inadvertently offending certain groups.\n\nOne potential solution could be to reevaluate the way we approach marriage, considering it as a civil union rather than a sacrament. This perspective acknowledges the government's role in recognizing and providing benefits to couples, without imposing its own values or interpretations. By doing so, we can avoid blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the distinction between marriage and civil unions becomes more nuanced. It's possible that the government's recognition of marriage as a civil union could be more inclusive, rather than a label imposed by a specific institution. This thought process also raises questions about the role of the government in defining what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage.\n\nIn the context of same-sex marriage, I believe that a civil union approach could provide a more neutral and inclusive framework. It allows the government to acknowledge the union of two consenting adults without imposing its own moral or religious values. Ultimately, the decision to redefine marriage is a matter of personal conviction, but it's essential to approach it with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it's reasonable to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage seems premature and unnecessary. The Constitution should be amended to address matters of significant national import, rather than issues that, while contentious, don't warrant such drastic action.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and civil unions requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. By reexamining our assumptions and considering the role of the government in defining marriage, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding that respects the diversity of individual perspectives.",
            "As someone with a Christian upbringing, I've always navigated the topic of homosexuality with a nuanced perspective. Having many close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to form a deeper understanding of their experiences and the complexities surrounding the issue. While I don't feel entirely in alignment with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle myself, I firmly believe in the importance of equality and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the individual states, rather than be dictated by federal law. This approach acknowledges the diversity of opinions and values across different regions, allowing each state to make decisions that reflect the unique needs and concerns of its citizens. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals are free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nI'm aware that some states lean Democratic and others Republican, and it's not surprising that Democratic states tend to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. However, I believe that individuals who choose to reside in a particular state have a responsibility to respect the values and laws that govern their community. By leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the states, we're allowing local leaders to make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being and happiness of their constituents.\n\nIn the case of former President Bush's stance on gay marriage, I disagree with his efforts to impose a national ban. As the President of the United States, he had a unique platform to shape the country's policies, but I don't believe that his opinions should supersede the autonomy of individual states. In fact, his impending departure from office highlights the impermanence of federal decisions and the importance of allowing states to chart their own course.\n\nUltimately, I believe that certain issues, like same-sex marriage, should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach recognizes the complexity of the issue and the varying values of different communities. By empowering states to make their own decisions, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination.",
            "The concept of Myspace as a public platform is often misunderstood. Upon reflection, it's clear that anything posted online can be accessed by anyone. This includes school officials, who may be checking for potential security threats, such as students engaging in substance use or other prohibited behaviors.\n\nWhile one may feel uncomfortable with the idea of school officials monitoring online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students. In this context, online monitoring can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent incidents like school shootings.\n\nThe idea that school officials might access Myspace profiles outside of their official capacity is also relevant. Even if a student doesn't explicitly state they're associated with the school, their profile can still be discovered through various means, including their home internet connections. \n\nSchool officials may use social media to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. This proactive approach can help prevent problems and make the school a safer place. In fact, many schools have implemented various safety protocols, such as lockdown drills, to prepare for potential threats.\n\nIn the case of the Myspace monitoring, the school officials' actions can be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure student safety. While it may seem invasive, their primary goal is to prevent harm and create a secure environment for all students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a way of holding onto information, making it difficult to erase past online activity. This highlights the importance of being mindful of one's online presence and the potential consequences of posting sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, while school officials may seem overzealous in their monitoring, their actions are ultimately aimed at creating a safer environment for students. This may involve accessing social media platforms like Myspace to identify potential issues and prevent harm.",
            "The invasion of Iraq was a decision that I initially supported, largely driven by the personal impact of 9/11 on my life. However, as I reflected further on the situation, I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional response to the attacks led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the potential outcomes of our involvement.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that we entered the conflict without a clear plan for the post-invasion period, which led to unforeseen challenges and setbacks. I think that our initial motivations were driven more by a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The President's decision to declare war on Iraq, while understandable in the context of the time, was also driven by public opinion and a desire for action.\n\nLooking back, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of imposing our will on a country with such a different cultural and historical context. The concept of war is perceived very differently in Iraq than it is in the US, and our actions were often viewed as an invasion rather than a liberation.\n\nI now believe that our presence in Iraq has not brought about the desired outcome and may have even exacerbated the situation. The ongoing conflict has highlighted the challenges of nation-building and the difficulty of imposing democratic values on a country with a different cultural identity. I think that we should have been more cautious in our approach and considered the long-term implications of our actions.\n\nWhile we have made some progress in Iraq, I believe that our continued presence is not sufficient to achieve lasting stability. I think that our involvement has actually hindered our own interests and that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region. Ultimately, I believe that the people of Iraq must take ownership of their country's future, and we should focus on supporting their efforts rather than trying to impose our will on them.\n\nI also believe that our initial motivations and actions were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a genuine desire to help the Iraqi people. Our actions were seen as an attempt to impose our values and way of life on a country that was not ready or willing to accept them. I think that this approach was misguided and has ultimately led to more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I initially supported the invasion of Iraq, I now believe that it was a mistake. Our actions were driven by emotion rather than careful planning and consideration, and our continued presence has not brought about the desired outcome. I think that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region and focus on supporting the people of Iraq rather than trying to impose our will on them."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church's views on certain issues may be contributing to its declining membership. While it's natural for institutions to hold strong convictions, their stance on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control may be perceived as outdated by some. This perceived rigidity can lead individuals to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable within the Church.\n\nFor instance, when a person holds a different viewpoint on abortion or gay marriage, they may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and potentially even alienate individuals from the faith. Essentially, the Church's stance on these issues may be driving people away.\n\nOne potential area for reform is in the Church's stance on female priests and married clergy. Some may argue that these changes could help the Church become more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience. However, it's challenging to predict the outcome, as human behavior is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Church's teachings on devotion and commitment are rooted in the idea that priests are married to God. This notion suggests that priests are expected to prioritize their spiritual duties above all else. Nevertheless, the idea that clergy cannot have a family life or personal relationships is not unique to the Church. Many individuals in various professions lead double lives, balancing their professional and personal responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's stance on certain issues and its stance on female priests and married clergy may be contributing to its declining membership. While some may view these stances as outdated, others may see them as essential to the Church's identity. Ultimately, the relationship between the Church and its members is complex and influenced by various factors.",
            "In my opinion, the idea that people's sexual orientation is solely a matter of personal choice is not a stance I subscribe to. I believe that individuals are born with their inherent nature, and it's not something that can be altered through conscious decision-making. This perspective leads me to think that it's unfair to hold people responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize that people's identities are not something they can change at will. For instance, while some individuals are born with a heterosexual inclination, others are born with a same-sex attraction. It's crucial to acknowledge that these are natural variations and not something that can be willfully chosen.\n\nWhen it comes to marriage, I believe that the federal government should not have a say in who individuals can marry. The issue is not a matter of national security or morality; it's a personal matter between two consenting adults. It's not the government's place to dictate who can form a union and who cannot.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people's sexual orientation is not a decision they made, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's essential to respect individuals for who they are and allow them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution.\n\nUltimately, I think it's crucial to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The government should not have the authority to interfere with personal relationships or dictate who can love whom.",
            "The notion of gay marriage legalization has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I firmly believe that this perspective is misguided. Essentially, the two are fundamentally different yet intertwined concepts that cannot be compared directly. The issue is often oversimplified, neglecting the multifaceted aspects that make relationships unique.\n\nOne oft-cited concern is the perceived impact on heterosexual families. However, this argument is based on an oversimplified understanding of the complexities involved. Studies have consistently shown that homosexual couples exhibit similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the fact that homosexual couples are not seeking to obtain a church-sanctioned marriage, but rather a legally recognized union provided by the government. If we separate church and state, the question of moral opposition becomes irrelevant. The provision of a marriage certificate should not be contingent upon the approval of a particular religious group.\n\nIn fact, the lack of equal rights for homosexual couples can be likened to a form of segregation. The notion that they are denied a fundamental right while others enjoy it is a clear infringement on their civil liberties.\n\nConcerns surrounding adoption, community integration, and the impact on children of gay couples are often cited as reasons to oppose gay marriage. However, these concerns are often based on unsubstantiated fears and biases. In reality, children raised by gay parents are not inherently disadvantaged, and their well-being is not predetermined by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nThe phenomenon of bullying and societal pressure faced by children of gay parents is a pressing issue that demands attention and action. Rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes, we should focus on creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.\n\nRegarding the role of government in this issue, I firmly believe that the federal government should play a more proactive role in ensuring the equality of all citizens. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only misguided but also hypocritical, given the government's stance on other issues such as the separation of church and state.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that gay couples are somehow flawed or damaged is a baseless stereotype that has been thoroughly debunked by reputable institutions. By ignoring the scientific consensus and instead relying on anecdotal evidence and personal biases, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and fear. It is time for us to reevaluate our stance on this issue and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One aspect of my summer experience at the hospital pharmacy has led me to consider the multifaceted nature of controlled substances. While certain medications may be prohibited, they continue to demonstrate significant therapeutic potential. In the context of public accessibility, I believe that such substances should not be made readily available. However, their use in medical settings is a different matter. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily negate its benefits.\n\nAs a pharmacy professional, I've seen firsthand the controlled use of substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse. Despite their illicit status, these medications are instrumental in alleviating pain and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, the medicinal properties of marijuana should be acknowledged and respected, rather than being dismissed due to societal stigma.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is not entirely apt, as marijuana's risks are distinct from those associated with excessive drinking. While both substances can be misused, their impacts differ significantly. A more nuanced approach to marijuana regulation would involve a gradual integration into mainstream society, accompanied by education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana is deeply ingrained, largely due to its classification as an illicit substance. However, this image is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of marijuana's risks and benefits. In fact, it's not as hazardous as other Schedule I substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the societal stigma surrounding marijuana, we can begin to view it as a legitimate treatment option, rather than a taboo.\n\nUltimately, a more informed and balanced perspective on marijuana is necessary, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and risks. By doing so, we can work towards a more responsible and evidence-based approach to its use and regulation.",
            "The Catholic Church has undergone significant transformations in recent years to adapt to the changing times. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms. As someone who has been involved with the church their whole life, I've witnessed firsthand the shift towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere. Even within my own experiences, I've noticed a change in the way people dress and engage with the church community.\n\nGrowing up, attending church on Sundays was a regular occurrence, and I would often get dressed up in my finest attire. However, that's no longer the case. The introduction of a shorter Teen Mass has made Sundays more accessible and relaxed, with attendees often wearing casual clothing, even jeans and khakis. This change is particularly noticeable during the warmer months when beachwear is a common sight.\n\nWhile I'm not well-versed in the church's internal politics, one thing is clear: the focus has shifted towards a more casual and welcoming environment. As for the accusations of pedophilia, I believe that these issues are complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I'm not convinced that this would have been the case. Research suggests that pedophilia is a deeply ingrained trait, often rooted in genetics. It's not something that can be easily addressed through changes in the church's policies or practices.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that individuals who are predisposed to pedophilia are unlikely to change their behavior, regardless of their marital status or religious affiliation. While it's essential to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing, I don't believe that the church's policies are to blame for these heinous crimes. Rather, it's the actions of individuals that have caused harm, and it's crucial to address these issues through education, support, and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's evolution towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere is a positive development, but it's essential to separate this from the complex issues surrounding pedophilia. By acknowledging the root causes of these problems and addressing them through a comprehensive approach, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive community for all.",
            "Upon reflection, I have come to realize that the premise we were initially considering had significant implications stemming from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration leveraged a complex series of events and pretexts to justify the invasion of Iraq, which ultimately led to the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, it has since been established that these claims were unfounded.\n\nI strongly believe that the Bush administration's actions and subsequent lack of accountability for these misrepresentations have been particularly egregious. Notably, Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, has since acknowledged his own doubts about the evidence presented at the time of the UN presentation. This demonstrates a disturbing disregard for truth and accountability, which I argue constitutes a serious breach of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions suggest a concerning disregard for the US Constitution and the principles it upholds. Since September 11th, I have witnessed a persistent attempt to marginalize key provisions of the Constitution, which has only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt is my understanding that the younger Bush had a pre-existing agenda to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy, which was motivated in part by his father's past experiences. This agenda may have been driven by a desire to secure access to new energy resources, a goal that is both ambitious and potentially problematic.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the complexities of the situation, I believe that the conflict has endured for far too long. A hasty withdrawal could lead to destabilization and increased bloodshed, potentially plunging the country into civil war. Alternatively, the proposed coalition of regional nations, which includes Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be a viable solution, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create long-term instability.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that the interim government is failing to assert its authority, with the Parliament struggling to establish a cohesive leadership and the Prime Minister lacking control. The influence of radical elements, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, is also contributing to the fractious nature of the political process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I struggle to articulate a clear solution, I firmly believe that the Bush administration's actions have been deeply problematic and that the situation in Iraq remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",
            "Upon reflection, I have mixed feelings regarding the War in Iraq. Initially, I was unsure of where to begin, but it became apparent that a declared war by Congress is a crucial factor in my opinion. Without such a declaration, the conflict seems more like a retaliatory measure in response to the 9/11 attacks. While I don't feel well-versed in the intricacies of the conflict, I understand that our presence in Iraq is aimed at establishing a democratic government and securing resources.\n\nHowever, this approach raises concerns about the feasibility and morality of our involvement. The prolonged duration of the war has led to widespread resentment and instability in the region. Moreover, the difficulty in establishing democracy in a foreign context is a daunting task, and our continued presence may only exacerbate the situation.\n\nOne argument in favor of continuing the war is the concern for the families of service members stationed in Iraq. It is essential to consider the human cost and the impact on the local population. Nevertheless, this perspective is overshadowed by the risk of cultural insensitivity and the potential for our actions to be perceived as an attempt to impose our values on another nation.\n\nA more nuanced approach might be to reevaluate our role in the conflict and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. The ongoing occupation has already led to the growth of extremist groups and increased hostility towards the United States. In light of this, it seems that our continued presence may ultimately be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, the War in Iraq is a complex issue, and my opinion is that it would be beneficial to reassess our involvement and consider a more measured approach. This would allow us to address the root causes of the conflict while minimizing the harm caused to the local population and our own nation.",
            "There are legitimate concerns regarding the government's involvement in declaring something as legal or illegal, particularly when it comes to matters of religious freedom. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it's essential to uphold this principle.\n\nWhen considering the potential for an amendment that restricts certain religious practices, it's crucial to examine the motivations behind this initiative. One must question whether the government is attempting to impose its will on a particular group, rather than allowing for religious tolerance and diversity.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the Constitution since its inception, fostering a culture of religious freedom in the United States. Proposing an amendment that would restrict this freedom would be counterintuitive and contradictory to the founding principles of the nation. Furthermore, such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, which raises significant concerns.\n\nThe government should refrain from intervening in matters of religious practice, as this would be an overreach of authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of religious groups. The president's personal beliefs, as a Catholic, do not provide a sufficient justification for proposing an amendment that discriminates against other faiths. Any decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities directly affected, rather than being imposed by the government.\n\nWhile some may argue that an amendment is necessary to address a perceived issue, a closer examination reveals that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that this amendment would have a positive impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that such an amendment could have unintended consequences, including stifling religious diversity and freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should not be involved in declaring certain religious practices as illegal, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the principles of separation of church and state. The decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities, rather than being imposed by the government.",
            "The Iraq War remains a highly debated topic, with many questioning the motives behind the United States' decision to invade the country in 2003. I firmly believe that the government's initial justifications for the war were not entirely transparent, and that the connection between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that the government played on the emotions of the American people, capitalizing on their outrage following the terrorist attacks of 2001. This led to a lack of critical evaluation of the potential consequences of invading Iraq. As someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was skeptical of the decision from the outset.\n\nThe parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking. Both conflicts involve attempts to impose democracy on foreign nations, often with disastrous results. The removal of the Iraqi government and the subsequent power vacuum led to chaos and instability, which the US was not adequately prepared to handle. This echoes the lessons of Vietnam, where the US struggled to establish a stable government and ultimately withdrew.\n\nThe war has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, with many soldiers continuing to die in a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The US government underestimated the complexity of rebuilding a nation and establishing a functioning democracy. This is a process that requires time, effort, and resources, as exemplified by the struggles our own country faced in its transition to democracy.\n\nMoreover, the US government's decision to invade Iraq raises questions about its motivations. While the stated goal was to promote democracy, many believe that the primary driver was access to Iraq's oil reserves. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, coupled with the fact that the US has not taken similar action against other nations with similar capabilities, such as North Korea, further fuels these suspicions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to go to war in Iraq was likely based on a mix of factors, including a desire to expand US influence and secure access to valuable resources. As the conflict continues to drag on, it is essential to re-evaluate the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was torn between supporting the incumbent, George Bush, and opposing the war. While I initially believed that allowing him to complete his term was the right decision, the ongoing conflict and the continued loss of American lives have made me question this stance. The war has become a protracted and complex issue, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to invest significant resources in the conflict, it is essential to consider the human cost and the potential long-term benefits of a US withdrawal.",
            "I would like to express my support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. My stance on this issue has been consistent throughout my life, and I firmly believe that marriage is a personal preference that should not be dictated by societal norms or external factors.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the possibility that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological factors, rather than solely by societal conditioning. This realization has led me to reconsider the notion that individuals should be denied rights based on their sexual orientation, which is often beyond their control.\n\nI believe that it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marry based on their sexual orientation, and I have always been an advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the role of government and politics should be limited to protecting individual rights, rather than imposing moral or societal values.\n\nIn my community, I have observed that same-sex couples function just like any other family unit, participating in everyday activities and contributing to their communities. It is disconcerting to see politicians attempting to redefine the concept of marriage to suit their own values, rather than respecting the diversity of human relationships.\n\nResearch suggests that sexual orientation may be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than purely by societal upbringing. This understanding has led me to question the notion that same-sex attraction is a choice, and to recognize the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage is a personal matter that should be between the individuals involved, rather than a public or political issue. Just as individuals are free to get married without public fanfare, same-sex couples should have the same right to enter into a committed partnership without fear of public scrutiny or judgment.",
            "There are certain expectations that come with posting content online. Once something is published on the internet, it becomes a public forum that anyone can access. As someone who has experience with this in a residential setting, I can attest to the fact that online activities can significantly impact how people perceive individuals.\n\nWhen discussing sensitive topics such as violence or threats, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of sharing them online. What may seem like a joke or a harmless comment to the poster can be misconstrued by others, potentially leading to serious repercussions.\n\nIn a school setting, if a student posts something alarming, it's not uncommon for school officials to investigate the situation further. This is often done to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff. While it's essential to respect students' online privacy, there are instances where school administrators may need to intervene.\n\nFor example, if a student posts something that raises concerns about their mental health or intentions, it's the school's responsibility to address the situation. This can be done without infringing on the student's privacy, as the information was shared publicly. However, it's also crucial to note that not all online activity warrants intervention.\n\nSchool officials should not engage in excessive monitoring of students' online activities, such as friending them on social media or tracking their phone conversations. If concerns are brought to their attention, it's essential to handle them in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nA similar principle applies to residential advisors like myself. While it's not necessary to be friends with residents on social media, we must be prepared to address any issues that arise from their online activity. This can be a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that once something is posted online, it's accessible to a wide audience. If you don't want certain information to be shared or don't want people to form a particular opinion about you, it's best to exercise caution when posting online.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its original purpose. Initially, the intention was to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, a goal that I believe is noble. However, over time, I fear that the primary motivation has shifted from a desire to promote democracy to a demonstration of military prowess.\n\nLooking back, I think the initial invasion was a powerful statement in itself, sending a clear message about our commitment to democracy. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict has raised concerns about the true reasons behind our involvement. If the primary objective was to establish democracy, it's likely that our efforts would have been more focused and decisive. Instead, it appears that we have become bogged down in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.\n\nIn my opinion, our original motivation was admirable, but it has been compromised by personal and ulterior motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. This has led to a war that has become increasingly complex and difficult to justify.\n\nI believe that we have already achieved a significant portion of our goals in the initial stages of the conflict. It's time to reassess our priorities and acknowledge that our continued involvement is no longer justifiable. The war has drained our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. As a result, I strongly believe that it's time to bring our troops home and allow the country to take ownership of its future.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that war should not be a long-term expenditure in our budget. We have pressing domestic concerns that require attention and funding, such as maintaining public roads, improving education, and providing quality healthcare. The financial burdens of this war have come at a high cost, including the loss of American lives and the erosion of our national funds. It's time for a change in direction and a renewed focus on our own nation's needs.",
            "The question of balancing online privacy with potential consequences is a complex one. If an individual shares personal information on a social networking site, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, users must accept friend requests from others to view their profiles, thereby granting permission to access their content. This understanding is crucial when contributing to online communities.\n\nHowever, the idea of monitoring students' online profiles to prevent potential harm raises concerns. While it may be possible for someone to stumble upon potentially problematic information, it's impractical and potentially discriminatory to have someone dedicated to scrutinizing individual profiles. The decision to monitor should be based on specific circumstances, such as evidence of suspicious behavior, rather than a general policy.\n\nMy personal experience with social media has taught me to be cautious about sharing personal information. Although I don't maintain a Myspace profile, I do have a Facebook account, and I'm aware of the risks associated with online interactions. A documentary I watched highlighted the ease with which an individual can gather information from social media profiles, which can be used to manipulate others. This has led me to limit the information I share online, while still allowing me to maintain connections with friends.\n\nHowever, I've also come to realize that it's difficult to control who has access to our online presence. Even with privacy settings in place, there's still a risk that others can view our information. This is why I'm careful about accepting friend requests and limit the amount of personal data I share.\n\nA recent conversation with my roommate about her high school experience shed light on the issue of school administrators banning students from using Myspace. While I'm not entirely sure about the reasoning behind this decision, it did raise questions about the extent of authority schools have over students' online activities.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between online privacy and potential consequences is a delicate one. While it's essential to be mindful of the information we share online, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of blanket policies aimed at monitoring students' online activities.",
            "The Iraq War has been a highly debated topic, with various perspectives emerging over time. Initially, many people, including myself, expressed opposition to the invasion. However, as the situation has evolved, the general consensus worldwide has shifted towards viewing the war as a regrettable decision. This is evident in the overwhelming majority of global polls, which suggest that approximately 75-80% of the international community, including a significant percentage of Iraqi citizens and US troops stationed in Iraq, consider the war to have been a mistake.\n\nThe complexities of the Middle East and the cultural differences between Western and Middle Eastern societies can make it challenging to implement successful democratic reforms. The notion that a foreign power can impose its values and governance structures on a region with a distinct history and cultural identity is a notion that has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly problematic, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking military action, particularly when the outcome is uncertain. The rapid escalation of the situation has led to a prolonged and arduous conflict, with numerous challenges and obstacles hindering a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering the prevailing sentiment among the Iraqi population and the international community, it is worth considering the possibility of a gradual withdrawal of US forces over the course of a year or more. This approach would allow for a more measured exit strategy while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences. Notably, a significant portion of Iraqis advocate for an immediate withdrawal, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the current presence.\n\nThe notion that the Iraqi people's decisions should be taken into account is a valid one. If they are telling us to leave, it is essential to consider their perspective and assess the situation objectively. Ultimately, if we were to withdraw and the situation were to deteriorate, we could argue that we had given the Iraqi people the opportunity to make their own decisions and that any negative outcomes would be a result of their choices, not ours.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War has been a multifaceted and intricate issue, with various stakeholders holding different views on its legitimacy and effectiveness. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it seems that a gradual withdrawal of US forces, potentially followed by international assistance, could be a more viable and responsible approach.",
            "One of the most pressing issues in the United States today is the persistence of gender discrimination. While progress has been made in recent years, it remains a significant hurdle in various industries. I firmly believe that societal attitudes and expectations play a substantial role in perpetuating this issue. For instance, in the corporate world, women often face barriers to advancement due to the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where despite having the necessary qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions in favor of male candidates.\n\nThis is not to say that men are immune to discrimination; on the contrary, they too can face difficulties in fields such as fashion, where traditional stereotypes can make it challenging for men to be taken seriously. The notion that men who are interested in fashion are somehow less masculine or less capable can be a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations around caregiving roles can also perpetuate gender discrimination. The stigma surrounding men who stay at home to care for their children is still prevalent, with many people viewing it as unconventional or even unnatural. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for stay-at-home dads, who are often judged for prioritizing family responsibilities over professional ambitions.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where traditional gender roles can be limiting. Men who work in fashion may be subject to skepticism simply because of their gender, with some people questioning their understanding of the industry.\n\nHowever, there are signs that attitudes are slowly shifting. As more women take on leadership roles and break down barriers in the corporate world, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, it is becoming clearer that traditional gender roles are no longer the only standard. By promoting the qualities and achievements of individuals who deviate from these norms, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that discrimination can take many forms, and individuals from different backgrounds may face unique challenges. For example, someone from a rural area may face bias due to their accent or lack of formal education, despite being intelligent and capable. Similarly, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may face prejudice based on their language or customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in addressing gender discrimination in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and working towards greater understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.",
            "My understanding is that while marijuana has not been fully legalized, it has undergone decriminalization, which has downgraded it from a criminal offense to a more akin to a traffic citation. This change involves a less severe outcome, such as receiving a fine rather than facing arrest, booking, and prosecution. Consequently, individuals cited for marijuana possession or use may face fewer consequences in the long run, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications, which can be detrimental to one's future.\n\nHowever, there are varying perspectives on the matter. On one hand, decriminalization can be economically advantageous for municipalities, as it reduces the costs associated with law enforcement, court proceedings, and public defense. This can be a significant concern for financially strained cities, making it a difficult decision to make. In contrast, some communities may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to philosophical or cultural opposition to marijuana.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, has taken a different approach, and it appears to have benefited from the change. As a result, they have redirected funds toward public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. This shift is a significant step forward, especially considering the economic constraints that many municipalities face.\n\nIt is essential to consider the potential consequences of full legalization, as it could lead to increased availability and visibility of marijuana. This might result in a rise in smoking-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. Moreover, societal norms and stigma surrounding marijuana use still exist, making it a sensitive topic in many contexts.\n\nInterestingly, while marijuana's effects on motor skills are not as pronounced as those of alcohol, its impact on lifestyle can be more profound for some individuals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that people react differently to substances, and personal characteristics, such as moderation and self-control, play a significant role in determining the outcome. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, making it challenging to generalize their impact on individuals.",
            "I believe that the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the institution has a rich history and a set of guiding principles that have been upheld for centuries. However, this steadfast commitment to tradition can sometimes make it difficult for the Church to adapt to changing times and circumstances.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this dilemma is the Church's stance on interfaith marriage. My own family's experience with this issue serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of a rigid adherence to doctrine. My parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in the Catholic Church because of the Church's refusal to accept my father's Episcopalian faith.\n\nThis experience has led me to wonder whether the Church's doctrine of love and acceptance can be reconciled with its practice of excluding those who do not conform to its norms. While the Catholic Church teaches that love and acceptance are fundamental principles, its actions often suggest a more limited and exclusive approach. This tension between theory and practice can be a source of frustration and disillusionment, particularly for those who seek a more inclusive and compassionate faith.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I share the view that it would not necessarily address the root causes of pedophilia within the Church. As I see it, the decision to engage in such behavior is a choice that is not directly related to marital status. In fact, my understanding is that individuals who are capable of such actions are likely to continue doing so regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition is an essential aspect of the Catholic Church, it must be balanced with a willingness to adapt and evolve. The Church's rigid stance on certain issues can sometimes hinder its ability to live up to its core values of love and acceptance. As the Church continues to navigate the complexities of modern society, it is essential that it find a way to reconcile its tradition with its practice, creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all its members.",
            "In this contentious issue, I find myself grappling with a certain degree of ambivalence. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I hesitate to take a definitive stance, as it's a complex problem that has sparked intense debate and emotional attachment. The delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage is indeed a challenging one to navigate without inadvertently offending certain groups.\n\nOne potential solution could be to reevaluate the way we approach marriage, considering it as a civil union rather than a sacrament. This perspective acknowledges the government's role in recognizing and providing benefits to couples, without imposing its own values or interpretations. By doing so, we can avoid blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the distinction between marriage and civil unions becomes more nuanced. It's possible that the government's recognition of marriage as a civil union could be more inclusive, rather than a label imposed by a specific institution. This thought process also raises questions about the role of the government in defining what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage.\n\nIn the context of same-sex marriage, I believe that a civil union approach could provide a more neutral and inclusive framework. It allows the government to acknowledge the union of two consenting adults without imposing its own moral or religious values. Ultimately, the decision to redefine marriage is a matter of personal conviction, but it's essential to approach it with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it's reasonable to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage seems premature and unnecessary. The Constitution should be amended to address matters of significant national import, rather than issues that, while contentious, don't warrant such drastic action.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and civil unions requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. By reexamining our assumptions and considering the role of the government in defining marriage, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding that respects the diversity of individual perspectives.",
            "As someone with a Christian upbringing, I've always navigated the topic of homosexuality with a nuanced perspective. Having many close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to form a deeper understanding of their experiences and the complexities surrounding the issue. While I don't feel entirely in alignment with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle myself, I firmly believe in the importance of equality and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the individual states, rather than be dictated by federal law. This approach acknowledges the diversity of opinions and values across different regions, allowing each state to make decisions that reflect the unique needs and concerns of its citizens. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals are free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nI'm aware that some states lean Democratic and others Republican, and it's not surprising that Democratic states tend to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. However, I believe that individuals who choose to reside in a particular state have a responsibility to respect the values and laws that govern their community. By leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the states, we're allowing local leaders to make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being and happiness of their constituents.\n\nIn the case of former President Bush's stance on gay marriage, I disagree with his efforts to impose a national ban. As the President of the United States, he had a unique platform to shape the country's policies, but I don't believe that his opinions should supersede the autonomy of individual states. In fact, his impending departure from office highlights the impermanence of federal decisions and the importance of allowing states to chart their own course.\n\nUltimately, I believe that certain issues, like same-sex marriage, should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach recognizes the complexity of the issue and the varying values of different communities. By empowering states to make their own decisions, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination.",
            "The concept of Myspace as a public platform is often misunderstood. Upon reflection, it's clear that anything posted online can be accessed by anyone. This includes school officials, who may be checking for potential security threats, such as students engaging in substance use or other prohibited behaviors.\n\nWhile one may feel uncomfortable with the idea of school officials monitoring online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students. In this context, online monitoring can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent incidents like school shootings.\n\nThe idea that school officials might access Myspace profiles outside of their official capacity is also relevant. Even if a student doesn't explicitly state they're associated with the school, their profile can still be discovered through various means, including their home internet connections. \n\nSchool officials may use social media to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. This proactive approach can help prevent problems and make the school a safer place. In fact, many schools have implemented various safety protocols, such as lockdown drills, to prepare for potential threats.\n\nIn the case of the Myspace monitoring, the school officials' actions can be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure student safety. While it may seem invasive, their primary goal is to prevent harm and create a secure environment for all students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a way of holding onto information, making it difficult to erase past online activity. This highlights the importance of being mindful of one's online presence and the potential consequences of posting sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, while school officials may seem overzealous in their monitoring, their actions are ultimately aimed at creating a safer environment for students. This may involve accessing social media platforms like Myspace to identify potential issues and prevent harm.",
            "The invasion of Iraq was a decision that I initially supported, largely driven by the personal impact of 9/11 on my life. However, as I reflected further on the situation, I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional response to the attacks led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the potential outcomes of our involvement.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that we entered the conflict without a clear plan for the post-invasion period, which led to unforeseen challenges and setbacks. I think that our initial motivations were driven more by a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The President's decision to declare war on Iraq, while understandable in the context of the time, was also driven by public opinion and a desire for action.\n\nLooking back, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of imposing our will on a country with such a different cultural and historical context. The concept of war is perceived very differently in Iraq than it is in the US, and our actions were often viewed as an invasion rather than a liberation.\n\nI now believe that our presence in Iraq has not brought about the desired outcome and may have even exacerbated the situation. The ongoing conflict has highlighted the challenges of nation-building and the difficulty of imposing democratic values on a country with a different cultural identity. I think that we should have been more cautious in our approach and considered the long-term implications of our actions.\n\nWhile we have made some progress in Iraq, I believe that our continued presence is not sufficient to achieve lasting stability. I think that our involvement has actually hindered our own interests and that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region. Ultimately, I believe that the people of Iraq must take ownership of their country's future, and we should focus on supporting their efforts rather than trying to impose our will on them.\n\nI also believe that our initial motivations and actions were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a genuine desire to help the Iraqi people. Our actions were seen as an attempt to impose our values and way of life on a country that was not ready or willing to accept them. I think that this approach was misguided and has ultimately led to more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I initially supported the invasion of Iraq, I now believe that it was a mistake. Our actions were driven by emotion rather than careful planning and consideration, and our continued presence has not brought about the desired outcome. I think that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region and focus on supporting the people of Iraq rather than trying to impose our will on them."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its following, and one of the possible reasons for this trend may be its stance on certain issues. The Church's views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have been a point of contention for some people. These issues might be seen as outdated and not in line with the evolving values of society.\n\nThe Church's strict views on these matters may be alienating individuals who hold different opinions. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable joining a community that considers these practices morally wrong. Similarly, individuals who believe in the importance of marriage equality or reproductive freedom may feel that the Church's stance on these issues is too restrictive.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to ordain women as priests and its requirement that priests remain celibate may be seen as limiting and outdated. While the Church views its priests as being devoted to God, it is hard to understand why they cannot have a family life like other professionals. It is reasonable to assume that having a spouse and children might not necessarily lead to a change in their work, just as it does not for many people in other careers.\n\nThe Church's adamant stance on certain issues might be driving away individuals who are looking for a more inclusive and accepting community. As a result, it is essential for the Church to re-evaluate its views and adapt to the changing values of society. By doing so, it may be possible to prevent further decline in its following and attract individuals who share its values but also expect a more nuanced approach to complex issues.",
            "The topic of same-sex marriage has garnered significant attention in recent years, with varying opinions on whether it should be recognized by law. From my perspective, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems that one's sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity.\n\nWhile I may not have extensively explored this topic, my stance is clear: I do not agree that the government should dictate who can and cannot get married based on their sexual orientation. I believe that this decision should be left to the individuals involved and those who care about them.\n\nThere is a misconception that people are born straight or gay, but the reality is that it's a complex issue that cannot be reduced to simple labels. However, I do believe that individuals should not be judged or penalized for who they are. The government's role in regulating marriage is not only unnecessary but also intrusive.\n\nIn my opinion, the government's involvement in same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security or moral values, but rather a personal matter that should be left to the individuals involved. It's essential to respect people's autonomy and allow them to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the federal government should not be involved in deciding who can get married and who cannot. This decision should be made by the individuals and those who care about them, not by the government. By doing so, we can promote a more accepting and inclusive society where everyone can live freely and authentically.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue for quite some time. However, as I've researched and considered the topic, I firmly believe that it's time for the federal government to reevaluate its stance on this matter. The primary reason for this is that there are numerous studies that demonstrate the similarities between same-sex relationships and traditional marriages. These studies indicate that both have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction, such as commitment, trust, and communication.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments against same-sex marriage is the notion that it poses a threat to the traditional family unit. However, this argument is based on a misconception that same-sex couples are fundamentally different from heterosexual couples. In reality, the dynamics of same-sex relationships are not significantly different from those of opposite-sex relationships. Both involve individuals forming emotional bonds, making long-term commitments, and contributing to their partner's well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that same-sex couples are seeking to marry in a church is a misconception. They are, in fact, seeking a legal recognition of their relationship in the form of a marriage certificate, a document issued by the government. By separating church and state, we can resolve the issue of religious disagreement and focus on the legal implications of marriage.\n\nThe concept of \"separate but equal\" is often used to describe the current system of civil unions, but this is a flawed analogy. In reality, same-sex couples are not being treated equally, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. This is evident in the areas of property taxes, healthcare, and adoption.\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding same-sex marriage is the impact on children. However, research suggests that children raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to experience difficulties than those raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, children of same-sex parents often face unique challenges, such as bullying and social stigma, which can be mitigated by providing support and education to the community.\n\nThe federal government should play a more active role in addressing these issues and promoting equality for all citizens. By making same-sex marriage legal in every state, we can ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The idea that morality is negotiable is a complex issue, and it's essential to consider the diverse perspectives and values of our society. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge the impact of misinformation and prejudice on public opinion. Many people base their opinions on misconceptions and stereotypes rather than evidence-based research. By promoting education and awareness, we can work towards a more informed and empathetic society.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be based on the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of all individuals, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society.",
            "When evaluating the availability of medicinal substances, it's crucial to separate the issue from societal stigmas. Working in a hospital pharmacy during the summer has given me a unique perspective on this matter. While certain substances may be prohibited due to their potential for abuse, their therapeutic benefits should not be dismissed outright.\n\nFor instance, many controlled substances that are illegal in their unregulated form are still used in pharmacies to treat a range of conditions. Medications like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples of controlled substances with proven medical value. Their benefits cannot be ignored solely because of their illicit status.\n\nSimilarly, marijuana possesses medicinal properties that warrant consideration. The fact that it is often associated with negative connotations should not overshadow its potential benefits. If we can differentiate between the substance itself and its potential for abuse, we can begin to reevaluate its role in healthcare.\n\nTo address concerns about responsible use, a gradual approach to legalization could be more effective than a sudden change. By removing the stigma surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more informed and responsible attitude towards its use.\n\nThe misconception surrounding marijuana stems from its reputation as an illicit substance. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively moderate. By reframing our understanding of marijuana, we may be able to promote more responsible use and its integration into medical practices.\n\nUltimately, a nuanced approach to substance regulation can help us make more informed decisions about the role of marijuana in healthcare.",
            "While reflecting on the evolution of my childhood church, I've observed a noticeable shift towards a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms; instead, the church has adapted to the 21st century's changing values. Sundays now observe a more casual dress code, with attendees often sporting jeans and casual wear, especially during the summer months. This shift is particularly evident in the condensed 30-minute masses, which cater to the busy lives of young families.\n\nAs I reminisce about my own experiences at a private school, I recall the weekly ritual of attending church with my friends. We'd dress up in our Sunday best, complete with matching outfits and accessories. However, even back then, the church was evolving, and this gradual change has continued over the years.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one. While some argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I disagree. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that transcends societal norms and religious affiliations. Statistics show that married individuals can still struggle with these impulses, and it's ultimately a matter of personal choice rather than a symptom of their marital status.\n\nIn fact, some denominations that allow their clergy to marry, such as certain Protestant churches, still struggle with these issues. It's essential to recognize that pedophilia is often a product of genetic predisposition and not a result of upbringing or environment. While genetic factors may play a significant role, it's also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with these tendencies often try to conceal them, even through marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church's adaptation to modern times is noteworthy, I don't believe that changes in their policies would have prevented the recent scandals. It's essential to address the root causes of these issues and hold those responsible accountable, rather than placing blame on the institution itself.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially had reservations about the premise, which I believe was largely overshadowed by the lingering sentiments following the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration used the threat of Iraq as a pretext for invasion, fueled by claims linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, which have since been discredited. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me, as it suggests a blatant disregard for the truth and a willingness to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe Bush administration's propensity for deception has been a recurring theme throughout their tenure, with even high-ranking officials like Colin Powell later expressing doubts about the evidence they presented at the time. This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The notion that they have consistently disregarded constitutional principles, particularly in the post-9/11 era, is troubling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were likely multifaceted, with some speculating that the younger Bush sought to expand the country's energy resources, a goal that was allegedly influenced by his father's administration. This underhanded approach to governance is concerning, particularly given the devastating consequences of the war.\n\nWhile I believe the conflict has dragged on for far too long, a hasty withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, potentially resulting in civil war and increased casualties. The proposed solution, involving a coalition of regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be the most effective approach, as it could further erode Iraq's sovereignty and create new challenges for the country's fragile government. The Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the influence of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nUltimately, the complex situation in Iraq has left me searching for a clear and effective solution, but one that balances the need for stability with the importance of respecting the country's sovereignty and promoting accountability within the political process.",
            "When considering the complexities of the Iraq War, my thoughts are multifaceted and influenced by various factors. It's essential to acknowledge that the conflict was not officially declared by Congress, which raises questions about its legitimacy. At the same time, it's crucial to remember that the initial motivations behind the war were in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were perpetrated by terrorists believed to have ties to Iraq.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that the war has become a protracted and complex issue, with multiple factors at play. The primary goal of establishing democracy in Iraq has been a driving force behind our continued presence, but it's also clear that this process is a long-term endeavor that cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, the war has resulted in significant human suffering and loss, including the displacement of families and the disruption of communities.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the cultural divide between our societies. While it's essential to acknowledge the right to self-determination, our attempts to impose our values and system on Iraq may ultimately exacerbate the problem. This could lead to a deepening hatred towards the United States and the proliferation of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has become a quagmire that will continue to plague us for years to come. It's essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to reevaluate our goals and strategies. While it's difficult to provide a clear solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complexities of the conflict and the cultural and historical context of Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the war in Iraq presents a complex web of issues that require thoughtful consideration and a multifaceted approach. It's essential to engage in a national dialogue that takes into account the various perspectives and interests at play, with the goal of finding a path forward that promotes peace, stability, and the well-being of the Iraqi people.",
            "The concept of government intervention in matters of religious freedom has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The First Amendment, with its explicit mention of the separation of church and state, serves as a cornerstone for the nation's commitment to religious tolerance. However, there are those who advocate for government involvement in regulating the practices of various faiths.\n\nIn my opinion, such an approach is misguided and contravenes the principles enshrined in the Constitution. By attempting to impose its will on matters of faith, the government would be overstepping its authority and infringing upon the rights of religious institutions. The Constitution's Founding Fathers deliberately established a framework that ensures the separation of church and state, allowing for the free exercise of religion without interference from the government.\n\nMoreover, the notion that the government should dictate what is permissible in a particular faith is a slippery slope. It would inevitably lead to favoritism, where the government would be choosing one denomination over another, potentially stifling the diversity of religious expression that is so essential to American society. The example of Catholic and Christian opposition to this particular issue in certain regions highlights the potential for favoritism and the danger of government overreach.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for the coexistence of various faiths in harmony. Any attempt to undermine this fundamental aspect of the Constitution would be a step backward, potentially restricting the rights of individuals and institutions rather than protecting them. In light of this, I believe it is essential to maintain the status quo and allow religious institutions to govern themselves, free from government interference.\n\nThe motivation behind government intervention in this matter appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good. The potential consequences of such an amendment would be far-reaching, and it is uncertain how it would impact the economy or society as a whole. It is crucial to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal opinions to dictate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should refrain from intervening in matters of faith, allowing religious institutions to operate freely and autonomously. The Constitution's founders wisely established a framework that prioritizes individual freedom and diversity, and it is our duty to uphold these principles and preserve the integrity of our democracy.",
            "The Iraq War has left a lasting impact on the world, and I believe the US government's motives for invading Iraq were not entirely transparent. Many people felt that the administration used the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This raised questions about the government's honesty with the American people. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to preemptive war, and I believe that the invasion of Iraq followed a pattern similar to the Vietnam War. Both conflicts involved an attempt to impose democracy on a foreign nation, which often results in a complex and challenging process. The removal of a country's government can lead to chaos and instability, and I think the US government underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding a new government in Iraq.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been significant, with many American lives lost. I believe that the administration failed to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, including the power vacuum that would be left by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. This lack of planning has led to ongoing instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe idea of spreading democracy is admirable, but it's a difficult and time-consuming process. Implementing a new form of government requires patience, understanding, and a deep knowledge of the local culture. In our own country, democracy was not established overnight, and it took many years of struggle and conflict to achieve.\n\nThe war in Iraq has also raised questions about the role of the US in global politics. I think the government's actions were motivated by a desire to control resources, particularly oil. The lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to accusations that the administration was not truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue, and the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences. I hope that the conflict will eventually come to an end and that a lasting peace will be established in the region. However, I fear that this may not be the case.",
            "My stance on gay marriage has been consistent - I firmly support the right to same-sex unions. I believe this is a matter of personal preference, and recent scientific discoveries have shown that sexuality can be influenced by biological factors rather than solely by societal influences. It's hard to justify denying individuals their rights due to something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's essential to separate politics and government from personal choices, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Marriage is a deeply personal commitment that should not be subject to external regulations. In fact, seeing same-sex couples in my neighborhood, who live and interact like any other family, has only strengthened my conviction.\n\nThe notion that politicians, like the previous administration, try to impose their interpretation of marriage on the public is not only misguided but also an overreach of power. I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a topic for public debate or scrutiny.\n\nResearch has shown that genetic and biological factors can contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. For instance, studies suggest that some people may be predisposed to be homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or environment. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting and respecting people's choices, rather than trying to justify discrimination.\n\nIn my opinion, the distinction between gay and heterosexual couples seeking marriage should not be a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so privately, without drawing attention to themselves. Conversely, if a same-sex couple wants to formalize their relationship, it's not right that it becomes a media sensation. This highlights the need to treat all relationships with equal respect and avoid making them the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "The internet has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of communication: its inherent public nature. As we've seen firsthand in our community, postings made online can have far-reaching consequences. As a Residential Advisor, I've had to navigate this issue personally, and it's a valuable lesson I've learned.\n\nWhen individuals share information online, they must consider the potential impact on their reputation. Sharing sensitive or inflammatory content can lead to misinterpretation and garner unwanted attention. This is particularly concerning when discussing topics like violence or threats, which can be misinterpreted or taken out of context. In such cases, school authorities often feel compelled to act, as they have a responsibility to ensure student safety.\n\nThe proliferation of social media has made it increasingly difficult to discern what's genuine and what's not. It's not uncommon for people to post humorous or thought-provoking content that's later misinterpreted or taken seriously. In one instance, a situation arose on our campus when a student's online posting was misinterpreted, leading to a thorough investigation. The individual in question had posted content that, in hindsight, may have been intended as a joke, but it sparked concern and warranted a closer look.\n\nThe internet's lack of inherent privacy is a critical aspect of online interactions. If an individual chooses to share information online, they should be prepared for it to be accessed by others. This includes school officials, who may be alerted to concerning content by students or parents. While it's essential to respect students' online autonomy, school authorities have a responsibility to act when they become aware of potential threats or dangers.\n\nIn terms of monitoring online activity, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between respecting students' online lives and protecting their safety. While I don't think school officials should engage in extensive surveillance, I do believe that they have a right to address concerns brought to their attention. This can be done by working with the individual or their parents to address the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for individuals to be mindful of their online presence and the potential consequences of their actions. As a Residential Advisor, I strive to educate my residents about the importance of responsible online behavior and the potential impact of their online actions on their reputation and well-being.",
            "The war has been prolonged for an unnecessarily extensive period, raising concerns about its original objectives. Initially, the intention to establish democracy in another country seemed justifiable, particularly considering the absence of a fair political system. However, it appears that the purpose has become increasingly distorted over time.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder if the war was instigated by personal grievances of the past, such as the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the primary goal was to introduce democracy, it would have been a commendable endeavor, but the presence of personal agendas would have tainted the mission.\n\nIt seems that the initial momentum was sufficient to convey a strong message, particularly in the early stages of the conflict. Nevertheless, the war has persisted for an inordinate amount of time, with the continuation of hostilities becoming increasingly questionable.\n\nIf the primary objective was to topple a tyrannical regime and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble pursuit. However, it appears that the motivations have become muddled over time, and the war has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe war has been waged for an excessive duration, and it is high time for a conclusion. The government of the invaded country must eventually be self-sufficient, and it is likely that this point has already been reached. The financial burden of the war is substantial, with billions of dollars being diverted from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare.\n\nThe allocation of funds to a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose is a concern, particularly when domestic problems are left unaddressed. The money spent on the war could be better utilized to address pressing issues within the country, such as education, healthcare, and public services.",
            "The question of whether schools should monitor students' online activities is a complex issue. While some may argue that privacy is compromised when individuals share personal information online, it's essential to consider the context in which this information is shared.\n\nWhen users post content on social media platforms like Myspace, they are, in effect, granting permission to a select group of individuals to view their profiles. This can include friends, classmates, and even acquaintances. While this may seem like an invasion of privacy on the surface, it's essential to recognize that individuals have some control over who can view their content.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether monitoring students' online activities is a viable solution to prevent potential threats. While it's unrealistic to expect a single individual to constantly monitor every student's profile, it's also difficult to justify discriminating against certain groups of students based on their online behavior.\n\nUltimately, the line between monitoring and surveillance is blurred. While some may argue that monitoring is necessary to prevent potential harm, others believe that it's an invasion of students' rights. The scenario where someone uses online information to prevent a life from being lost raises important questions about the role of social media in ensuring student safety.\n\nPersonally, having a social media presence can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, it allows individuals to connect with friends and maintain relationships. On the other hand, it can also expose users to potential risks, such as online harassment or stalking. As someone who uses Facebook, I'm aware of the importance of being cautious when sharing personal information online.\n\nA recent incident I saw on TV highlighted the ease with which individuals can gather information about others online. This raised concerns about the potential consequences of sharing personal details, such as screen names and class schedules, on social media. However, I also recognize the value of social media in maintaining relationships and staying connected with friends.\n\nThe issue of social media monitoring in schools is another area of concern. In some cases, schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, sparking questions about the extent of their authority to regulate students' online activities. While this may be seen as a way to ensure student safety, it's also essential to consider the implications for students' freedom of expression and online freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of social media monitoring is a nuanced one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. As we navigate the complexities of online interactions, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of our actions and the importance of balancing individual rights with the need for student safety.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and I must admit that discussing it makes me feel uncomfortable. Reflecting on my own stance, I realize that I initially opposed the invasion, aligning with the prevailing public opinion at the time. However, the ongoing debate has led me to question the war's validity. A significant majority of global citizens, including Iraqis and U.S. troops stationed in the region, share my initial concerns. According to various polls, roughly 75-80% of the international community believes the invasion was a misguided decision.\n\nThe complexities of the situation are evident when considering the cultural and historical context of the Middle East. The significant cultural disparities between the U.S. and the region create a challenging environment for implementing democracy. It's essential to acknowledge that the people of Iraq would have chosen a different approach to governance, rather than one imposed by an external force.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a problematic leader, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons before embarking on a costly and potentially disastrous intervention. The consequences of the invasion have been severe, and the ongoing occupation has created a seemingly intractable situation.\n\nI'm not convinced by the administration's arguments for continued involvement. While they may have valid concerns about the potential consequences of a hasty withdrawal, I'm yet to be persuaded by their reasoning. A gradual exit strategy over the course of a year or more might be a more viable option. However, I struggle to see a compelling argument for prolonging the occupation.\n\nA striking statistic I encountered highlights the sentiment of the Iraqi people: a significant majority believes that the U.S. should leave within the year, with some even advocating for an immediate withdrawal. As we claim to be intervening to help the Iraqi people, it's worth considering their perspective and potential solutions that prioritize their needs and desires.\n\nUltimately, even if we were to withdraw, we could still maintain a relationship with the Iraqi people and attempt to rectify any harm caused. This approach would at least ensure that we're not exacerbating the situation and could potentially be seen as a more humanitarian gesture. However, it's essential to acknowledge that our actions in the Middle East have not been without controversy, and it's uncertain whether we can ever fully be viewed as benevolent actors in the region.",
            "While it's undeniable that progress has been made in reducing inequality, I firmly believe that the United States still grapples with significant gender biases. It's essential to acknowledge that these prejudices can manifest differently depending on the specific industry and societal context.\n\nIn the professional sphere, the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where women face difficulties in advancing to leadership positions, persists. Despite having the necessary qualifications, women often encounter resistance to their promotion due to deeply ingrained societal expectations. This bias is not limited to women; men in traditionally masculine fields like business and industry may also face challenges. For instance, a male staying at home with children may be met with skepticism, as societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\n\nSimilarly, in the fashion industry, there's a tendency to dismiss men who are passionate about fashion, assuming that their interests are not truly authentic. This attitude can be attributed to a narrow understanding of masculinity and the expectation that men should conform to traditional norms.\n\nEfforts to combat these biases are hindered by the deeply ingrained nature of these attitudes. However, there are signs of progress, such as women rising to leadership positions and increasing acceptance of stay-at-home dads. To accelerate change, it's crucial to promote the qualities and achievements of individuals who defy traditional stereotypes, rather than forcing them upon others. A delicate balance must be struck between pushing for progress and avoiding resistance.\n\nInterestingly, biases can also manifest across different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations. For instance, an individual from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those with more refined communication skills, despite being highly intelligent and capable. This highlights the complexity of the issue, which extends beyond gender to include factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to recognize that overcoming these biases will require a sustained effort and a nuanced understanding of the various factors at play.",
            "My understanding is that the substance in question has undergone a significant transformation in the legal sphere. While it was previously considered a criminal offense, it has been decriminalized, essentially relegating it to a fine-able infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change eliminates the need for arrests, court appearances, and the associated costs that come with them. However, the ramifications of being caught with the substance still persist, particularly in terms of job prospects and social implications.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of decriminalization is the financial aspect. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for the substance is costly, and the resources allocated to this endeavor could be redirected towards more pressing community needs. Municipalities grappling with financial constraints may be hesitant to adopt such a policy, even if it would yield significant financial benefits.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, has taken a more progressive stance, and the city has reportedly seen a substantial increase in available funds for public education, social programs, and other community initiatives. While it's essential to consider the potential consequences of widespread use, the financial benefits of decriminalization cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the substance's potential impact on society is multifaceted. While some may view it as a relatively benign substance, others may be uncomfortable with its presence in public spaces. The fear of impaired driving and the ongoing stigma surrounding the substance's use are valid concerns.\n\nThe effects of the substance vary greatly from person to person, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about its impact. Some individuals may be able to moderate their use, while others may struggle with its consequences. Both the substance in question and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with nuance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize the substance is a complex one, influenced by a range of factors, including personal attitudes, societal norms, and financial considerations.",
            "While I agree with many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that adaptability to change is essential. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, but it's equally important to ensure that these customs don't hinder its ability to grow and evolve. \n\nOne area where the Catholic Church's strict adherence to doctrine and tradition can be problematic is in its stance on interfaith relationships. For instance, my parents, one a practicing Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This experience made me realize that the Church's exclusivity can sometimes lead to a lack of tolerance for those who don't conform to its teachings.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between Catholic doctrine and practice is another area of concern. The Church's emphasis on love and acceptance is contradicted by its refusal to accept those who don't meet its standards. This paradox can be jarring, especially when considering the long history of the Church.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that marriage could help prevent instances of misconduct, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that often involves a pattern of behavior rather than a specific circumstance. Therefore, I'm not sure that allowing priests to marry would be a deterrent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's traditional approach can be both a strength and a weakness. While its commitment to its teachings is admirable, it's essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of its strict adherence to doctrine and tradition. By acknowledging these complexities, the Church can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach.",
            "The issue at hand presents a complex challenge, as it navigates the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. This dichotomy is particularly tricky to resolve without alienating certain groups. Ultimately, my stance on the matter remains unclear, as I find it difficult to definitively assert the legitimacy of either perspective.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the distinction between marriage and civil unions is a crucial point of contention. The fact that civil unions confer similar benefits to those of marriage, such as tax advantages, suggests that the government should not dictate the legitimacy of a union based on its religious connotations. In essence, a civil union merely represents a legally recognized partnership between two individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nIf we were to view marriage solely as a civil institution, we could avoid conflating church and state. This would also enable the government to focus on the practical aspects of marriage, such as the union of two individuals, rather than its spiritual or religious undertones. Consequently, the legalization of gay marriage would not be a contentious issue, as it would be recognized as a civil union, akin to any other.\n\nIf a consensus is reached among the states, it would be reasonable to push for federal legislation to codify this understanding. However, I strongly believe that banning gay marriage by way of a constitutional amendment is an extreme measure. The Constitution should not be amended to address a matter of such limited significance, particularly when it would disproportionately affect a minority group.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of gay marriage should not be elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment. It is not a matter of sufficient magnitude to warrant such a drastic measure, and it is essential to maintain a separation between church and state to ensure that the government does not impose its values on its citizens.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have often grappled with the complexities of the LGBTQ+ community. While my upbringing has informed my views, it has also led me to appreciate the diversity of perspectives within this issue. My friends who identify as gay have shown me the importance of understanding and empathy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their personal lives, free from undue influence from the federal government. I think that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach acknowledges the differences in cultural values and societal norms that exist between various regions.\n\nI recognize that some states, particularly those with a predominantly democratic lean, may be more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights. However, I also believe that individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local values and decisions that come with that choice.\n\nWhile the current federal ban on gay marriage has been a topic of controversy, I think it's essential to consider the implications of a federal decision on the lives of individuals. In my opinion, the president's role should be to ensure that each state has the freedom to make its own decisions, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe changing landscape of U.S. politics, including the upcoming presidential election, underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. Rather than relying on a federal mandate, I believe that states should have the authority to decide what works best for their communities. This approach would allow for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that each state should have the autonomy to make its own decisions regarding same-sex marriage, rather than deferring to the federal government. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "When considering the implications of school officials monitoring student online activity, it's essential to acknowledge that social media platforms like Myspace are, by definition, public spaces. As such, any information posted on these platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. In the context of preventing potential harm, such as school shootings, it's reasonable to assume that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety.\n\nIn this light, if school officials discover content on Myspace that indicates students are engaging in illicit behavior, it's not an invasion of privacy if they take action to address the issue. In fact, it's a necessary step in maintaining a secure learning environment. This approach is analogous to the measures taken in schools to prepare for potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness.\n\nFor instance, my own high school experience involved regular lockdown drills and safety protocols, which were implemented in response to national security concerns, including the possibility of terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to school shootings, the underlying principle is the same: to create a safe and secure environment for students.\n\nIn the specific case of school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and create a safer school environment. While some might view this as an invasion of privacy, it's essential to weigh this against the potential consequences of inaction. By taking proactive steps to address potential threats, school officials can help prevent incidents like the Columbine shooting.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring student online activity is complex and multifaceted. However, when considering the potential consequences of inaction, it's clear that proactive measures to ensure student safety are justified.",
            "The events following the catastrophic events of 9/11 had a profound impact on America's foreign policy. Initially, I was in favor of taking a proactive approach to address the threat posed by terrorism. However, as time passed, I began to question the strategic decisions made by our government. It is my opinion that the war in Iraq was fought without a clear plan or a thorough understanding of the consequences. The emotional response to 9/11 led to a hasty decision-making process that prioritized immediate action over long-term strategy.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the local culture. Our military intervention was met with resistance, and the conflict escalated. The war in Iraq has been a protracted and costly endeavor that has yielded limited progress. I now question the effectiveness of our presence in the region.\n\nOne of the primary concerns I have is that our efforts have not led to lasting stability in Iraq. The ongoing conflict between various factions has hindered our ability to make a meaningful impact. I firmly believe that as long as these groups are engaged in internal power struggles, they will be unable to focus on external threats, including those posed by the United States. In my opinion, our continued involvement in the conflict is not a viable solution.\n\nMoreover, I think it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of war differs significantly between Western and Middle Eastern cultures. The aftermath of war in Iraq has been marked by chaos, and I fear that our military presence has only exacerbated the situation. It appears to me that the primary objective of our involvement was to remove Saddam Hussein from power, rather than to establish a stable and self-sufficient government.\n\nA more considered approach might have yielded better results. A more nuanced understanding of the local dynamics and a clear plan for our objectives could have led to a more effective and sustainable resolution. In my opinion, the war in Iraq was a product of a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy.\n\nLooking back, I believe that our involvement in Iraq has been a costly and misguided endeavor. We should have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing diplomacy and international cooperation over military intervention. In the end, I think our continued presence in the region is not a solution, but rather a cause of further instability."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its following, and one of the possible reasons for this trend may be its stance on certain issues. The Church's views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have been a point of contention for some people. These issues might be seen as outdated and not in line with the evolving values of society.\n\nThe Church's strict views on these matters may be alienating individuals who hold different opinions. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable joining a community that considers these practices morally wrong. Similarly, individuals who believe in the importance of marriage equality or reproductive freedom may feel that the Church's stance on these issues is too restrictive.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to ordain women as priests and its requirement that priests remain celibate may be seen as limiting and outdated. While the Church views its priests as being devoted to God, it is hard to understand why they cannot have a family life like other professionals. It is reasonable to assume that having a spouse and children might not necessarily lead to a change in their work, just as it does not for many people in other careers.\n\nThe Church's adamant stance on certain issues might be driving away individuals who are looking for a more inclusive and accepting community. As a result, it is essential for the Church to re-evaluate its views and adapt to the changing values of society. By doing so, it may be possible to prevent further decline in its following and attract individuals who share its values but also expect a more nuanced approach to complex issues.",
            "The topic of same-sex marriage has garnered significant attention in recent years, with varying opinions on whether it should be recognized by law. From my perspective, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems that one's sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity.\n\nWhile I may not have extensively explored this topic, my stance is clear: I do not agree that the government should dictate who can and cannot get married based on their sexual orientation. I believe that this decision should be left to the individuals involved and those who care about them.\n\nThere is a misconception that people are born straight or gay, but the reality is that it's a complex issue that cannot be reduced to simple labels. However, I do believe that individuals should not be judged or penalized for who they are. The government's role in regulating marriage is not only unnecessary but also intrusive.\n\nIn my opinion, the government's involvement in same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security or moral values, but rather a personal matter that should be left to the individuals involved. It's essential to respect people's autonomy and allow them to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the federal government should not be involved in deciding who can get married and who cannot. This decision should be made by the individuals and those who care about them, not by the government. By doing so, we can promote a more accepting and inclusive society where everyone can live freely and authentically.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue for quite some time. However, as I've researched and considered the topic, I firmly believe that it's time for the federal government to reevaluate its stance on this matter. The primary reason for this is that there are numerous studies that demonstrate the similarities between same-sex relationships and traditional marriages. These studies indicate that both have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction, such as commitment, trust, and communication.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments against same-sex marriage is the notion that it poses a threat to the traditional family unit. However, this argument is based on a misconception that same-sex couples are fundamentally different from heterosexual couples. In reality, the dynamics of same-sex relationships are not significantly different from those of opposite-sex relationships. Both involve individuals forming emotional bonds, making long-term commitments, and contributing to their partner's well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that same-sex couples are seeking to marry in a church is a misconception. They are, in fact, seeking a legal recognition of their relationship in the form of a marriage certificate, a document issued by the government. By separating church and state, we can resolve the issue of religious disagreement and focus on the legal implications of marriage.\n\nThe concept of \"separate but equal\" is often used to describe the current system of civil unions, but this is a flawed analogy. In reality, same-sex couples are not being treated equally, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. This is evident in the areas of property taxes, healthcare, and adoption.\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding same-sex marriage is the impact on children. However, research suggests that children raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to experience difficulties than those raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, children of same-sex parents often face unique challenges, such as bullying and social stigma, which can be mitigated by providing support and education to the community.\n\nThe federal government should play a more active role in addressing these issues and promoting equality for all citizens. By making same-sex marriage legal in every state, we can ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The idea that morality is negotiable is a complex issue, and it's essential to consider the diverse perspectives and values of our society. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge the impact of misinformation and prejudice on public opinion. Many people base their opinions on misconceptions and stereotypes rather than evidence-based research. By promoting education and awareness, we can work towards a more informed and empathetic society.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be based on the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of all individuals, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society.",
            "When evaluating the availability of medicinal substances, it's crucial to separate the issue from societal stigmas. Working in a hospital pharmacy during the summer has given me a unique perspective on this matter. While certain substances may be prohibited due to their potential for abuse, their therapeutic benefits should not be dismissed outright.\n\nFor instance, many controlled substances that are illegal in their unregulated form are still used in pharmacies to treat a range of conditions. Medications like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples of controlled substances with proven medical value. Their benefits cannot be ignored solely because of their illicit status.\n\nSimilarly, marijuana possesses medicinal properties that warrant consideration. The fact that it is often associated with negative connotations should not overshadow its potential benefits. If we can differentiate between the substance itself and its potential for abuse, we can begin to reevaluate its role in healthcare.\n\nTo address concerns about responsible use, a gradual approach to legalization could be more effective than a sudden change. By removing the stigma surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more informed and responsible attitude towards its use.\n\nThe misconception surrounding marijuana stems from its reputation as an illicit substance. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively moderate. By reframing our understanding of marijuana, we may be able to promote more responsible use and its integration into medical practices.\n\nUltimately, a nuanced approach to substance regulation can help us make more informed decisions about the role of marijuana in healthcare.",
            "While reflecting on the evolution of my childhood church, I've observed a noticeable shift towards a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms; instead, the church has adapted to the 21st century's changing values. Sundays now observe a more casual dress code, with attendees often sporting jeans and casual wear, especially during the summer months. This shift is particularly evident in the condensed 30-minute masses, which cater to the busy lives of young families.\n\nAs I reminisce about my own experiences at a private school, I recall the weekly ritual of attending church with my friends. We'd dress up in our Sunday best, complete with matching outfits and accessories. However, even back then, the church was evolving, and this gradual change has continued over the years.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one. While some argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I disagree. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that transcends societal norms and religious affiliations. Statistics show that married individuals can still struggle with these impulses, and it's ultimately a matter of personal choice rather than a symptom of their marital status.\n\nIn fact, some denominations that allow their clergy to marry, such as certain Protestant churches, still struggle with these issues. It's essential to recognize that pedophilia is often a product of genetic predisposition and not a result of upbringing or environment. While genetic factors may play a significant role, it's also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with these tendencies often try to conceal them, even through marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church's adaptation to modern times is noteworthy, I don't believe that changes in their policies would have prevented the recent scandals. It's essential to address the root causes of these issues and hold those responsible accountable, rather than placing blame on the institution itself.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially had reservations about the premise, which I believe was largely overshadowed by the lingering sentiments following the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration used the threat of Iraq as a pretext for invasion, fueled by claims linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, which have since been discredited. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me, as it suggests a blatant disregard for the truth and a willingness to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe Bush administration's propensity for deception has been a recurring theme throughout their tenure, with even high-ranking officials like Colin Powell later expressing doubts about the evidence they presented at the time. This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The notion that they have consistently disregarded constitutional principles, particularly in the post-9/11 era, is troubling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were likely multifaceted, with some speculating that the younger Bush sought to expand the country's energy resources, a goal that was allegedly influenced by his father's administration. This underhanded approach to governance is concerning, particularly given the devastating consequences of the war.\n\nWhile I believe the conflict has dragged on for far too long, a hasty withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, potentially resulting in civil war and increased casualties. The proposed solution, involving a coalition of regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be the most effective approach, as it could further erode Iraq's sovereignty and create new challenges for the country's fragile government. The Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the influence of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nUltimately, the complex situation in Iraq has left me searching for a clear and effective solution, but one that balances the need for stability with the importance of respecting the country's sovereignty and promoting accountability within the political process.",
            "When considering the complexities of the Iraq War, my thoughts are multifaceted and influenced by various factors. It's essential to acknowledge that the conflict was not officially declared by Congress, which raises questions about its legitimacy. At the same time, it's crucial to remember that the initial motivations behind the war were in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were perpetrated by terrorists believed to have ties to Iraq.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that the war has become a protracted and complex issue, with multiple factors at play. The primary goal of establishing democracy in Iraq has been a driving force behind our continued presence, but it's also clear that this process is a long-term endeavor that cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, the war has resulted in significant human suffering and loss, including the displacement of families and the disruption of communities.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the cultural divide between our societies. While it's essential to acknowledge the right to self-determination, our attempts to impose our values and system on Iraq may ultimately exacerbate the problem. This could lead to a deepening hatred towards the United States and the proliferation of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has become a quagmire that will continue to plague us for years to come. It's essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to reevaluate our goals and strategies. While it's difficult to provide a clear solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complexities of the conflict and the cultural and historical context of Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the war in Iraq presents a complex web of issues that require thoughtful consideration and a multifaceted approach. It's essential to engage in a national dialogue that takes into account the various perspectives and interests at play, with the goal of finding a path forward that promotes peace, stability, and the well-being of the Iraqi people.",
            "The concept of government intervention in matters of religious freedom has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The First Amendment, with its explicit mention of the separation of church and state, serves as a cornerstone for the nation's commitment to religious tolerance. However, there are those who advocate for government involvement in regulating the practices of various faiths.\n\nIn my opinion, such an approach is misguided and contravenes the principles enshrined in the Constitution. By attempting to impose its will on matters of faith, the government would be overstepping its authority and infringing upon the rights of religious institutions. The Constitution's Founding Fathers deliberately established a framework that ensures the separation of church and state, allowing for the free exercise of religion without interference from the government.\n\nMoreover, the notion that the government should dictate what is permissible in a particular faith is a slippery slope. It would inevitably lead to favoritism, where the government would be choosing one denomination over another, potentially stifling the diversity of religious expression that is so essential to American society. The example of Catholic and Christian opposition to this particular issue in certain regions highlights the potential for favoritism and the danger of government overreach.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for the coexistence of various faiths in harmony. Any attempt to undermine this fundamental aspect of the Constitution would be a step backward, potentially restricting the rights of individuals and institutions rather than protecting them. In light of this, I believe it is essential to maintain the status quo and allow religious institutions to govern themselves, free from government interference.\n\nThe motivation behind government intervention in this matter appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good. The potential consequences of such an amendment would be far-reaching, and it is uncertain how it would impact the economy or society as a whole. It is crucial to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal opinions to dictate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should refrain from intervening in matters of faith, allowing religious institutions to operate freely and autonomously. The Constitution's founders wisely established a framework that prioritizes individual freedom and diversity, and it is our duty to uphold these principles and preserve the integrity of our democracy.",
            "The Iraq War has left a lasting impact on the world, and I believe the US government's motives for invading Iraq were not entirely transparent. Many people felt that the administration used the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This raised questions about the government's honesty with the American people. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to preemptive war, and I believe that the invasion of Iraq followed a pattern similar to the Vietnam War. Both conflicts involved an attempt to impose democracy on a foreign nation, which often results in a complex and challenging process. The removal of a country's government can lead to chaos and instability, and I think the US government underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding a new government in Iraq.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been significant, with many American lives lost. I believe that the administration failed to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, including the power vacuum that would be left by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. This lack of planning has led to ongoing instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe idea of spreading democracy is admirable, but it's a difficult and time-consuming process. Implementing a new form of government requires patience, understanding, and a deep knowledge of the local culture. In our own country, democracy was not established overnight, and it took many years of struggle and conflict to achieve.\n\nThe war in Iraq has also raised questions about the role of the US in global politics. I think the government's actions were motivated by a desire to control resources, particularly oil. The lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to accusations that the administration was not truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue, and the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences. I hope that the conflict will eventually come to an end and that a lasting peace will be established in the region. However, I fear that this may not be the case.",
            "My stance on gay marriage has been consistent - I firmly support the right to same-sex unions. I believe this is a matter of personal preference, and recent scientific discoveries have shown that sexuality can be influenced by biological factors rather than solely by societal influences. It's hard to justify denying individuals their rights due to something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's essential to separate politics and government from personal choices, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Marriage is a deeply personal commitment that should not be subject to external regulations. In fact, seeing same-sex couples in my neighborhood, who live and interact like any other family, has only strengthened my conviction.\n\nThe notion that politicians, like the previous administration, try to impose their interpretation of marriage on the public is not only misguided but also an overreach of power. I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a topic for public debate or scrutiny.\n\nResearch has shown that genetic and biological factors can contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. For instance, studies suggest that some people may be predisposed to be homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or environment. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting and respecting people's choices, rather than trying to justify discrimination.\n\nIn my opinion, the distinction between gay and heterosexual couples seeking marriage should not be a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so privately, without drawing attention to themselves. Conversely, if a same-sex couple wants to formalize their relationship, it's not right that it becomes a media sensation. This highlights the need to treat all relationships with equal respect and avoid making them the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "The internet has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of communication: its inherent public nature. As we've seen firsthand in our community, postings made online can have far-reaching consequences. As a Residential Advisor, I've had to navigate this issue personally, and it's a valuable lesson I've learned.\n\nWhen individuals share information online, they must consider the potential impact on their reputation. Sharing sensitive or inflammatory content can lead to misinterpretation and garner unwanted attention. This is particularly concerning when discussing topics like violence or threats, which can be misinterpreted or taken out of context. In such cases, school authorities often feel compelled to act, as they have a responsibility to ensure student safety.\n\nThe proliferation of social media has made it increasingly difficult to discern what's genuine and what's not. It's not uncommon for people to post humorous or thought-provoking content that's later misinterpreted or taken seriously. In one instance, a situation arose on our campus when a student's online posting was misinterpreted, leading to a thorough investigation. The individual in question had posted content that, in hindsight, may have been intended as a joke, but it sparked concern and warranted a closer look.\n\nThe internet's lack of inherent privacy is a critical aspect of online interactions. If an individual chooses to share information online, they should be prepared for it to be accessed by others. This includes school officials, who may be alerted to concerning content by students or parents. While it's essential to respect students' online autonomy, school authorities have a responsibility to act when they become aware of potential threats or dangers.\n\nIn terms of monitoring online activity, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between respecting students' online lives and protecting their safety. While I don't think school officials should engage in extensive surveillance, I do believe that they have a right to address concerns brought to their attention. This can be done by working with the individual or their parents to address the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for individuals to be mindful of their online presence and the potential consequences of their actions. As a Residential Advisor, I strive to educate my residents about the importance of responsible online behavior and the potential impact of their online actions on their reputation and well-being.",
            "The war has been prolonged for an unnecessarily extensive period, raising concerns about its original objectives. Initially, the intention to establish democracy in another country seemed justifiable, particularly considering the absence of a fair political system. However, it appears that the purpose has become increasingly distorted over time.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder if the war was instigated by personal grievances of the past, such as the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the primary goal was to introduce democracy, it would have been a commendable endeavor, but the presence of personal agendas would have tainted the mission.\n\nIt seems that the initial momentum was sufficient to convey a strong message, particularly in the early stages of the conflict. Nevertheless, the war has persisted for an inordinate amount of time, with the continuation of hostilities becoming increasingly questionable.\n\nIf the primary objective was to topple a tyrannical regime and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble pursuit. However, it appears that the motivations have become muddled over time, and the war has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe war has been waged for an excessive duration, and it is high time for a conclusion. The government of the invaded country must eventually be self-sufficient, and it is likely that this point has already been reached. The financial burden of the war is substantial, with billions of dollars being diverted from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare.\n\nThe allocation of funds to a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose is a concern, particularly when domestic problems are left unaddressed. The money spent on the war could be better utilized to address pressing issues within the country, such as education, healthcare, and public services.",
            "The question of whether schools should monitor students' online activities is a complex issue. While some may argue that privacy is compromised when individuals share personal information online, it's essential to consider the context in which this information is shared.\n\nWhen users post content on social media platforms like Myspace, they are, in effect, granting permission to a select group of individuals to view their profiles. This can include friends, classmates, and even acquaintances. While this may seem like an invasion of privacy on the surface, it's essential to recognize that individuals have some control over who can view their content.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether monitoring students' online activities is a viable solution to prevent potential threats. While it's unrealistic to expect a single individual to constantly monitor every student's profile, it's also difficult to justify discriminating against certain groups of students based on their online behavior.\n\nUltimately, the line between monitoring and surveillance is blurred. While some may argue that monitoring is necessary to prevent potential harm, others believe that it's an invasion of students' rights. The scenario where someone uses online information to prevent a life from being lost raises important questions about the role of social media in ensuring student safety.\n\nPersonally, having a social media presence can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, it allows individuals to connect with friends and maintain relationships. On the other hand, it can also expose users to potential risks, such as online harassment or stalking. As someone who uses Facebook, I'm aware of the importance of being cautious when sharing personal information online.\n\nA recent incident I saw on TV highlighted the ease with which individuals can gather information about others online. This raised concerns about the potential consequences of sharing personal details, such as screen names and class schedules, on social media. However, I also recognize the value of social media in maintaining relationships and staying connected with friends.\n\nThe issue of social media monitoring in schools is another area of concern. In some cases, schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, sparking questions about the extent of their authority to regulate students' online activities. While this may be seen as a way to ensure student safety, it's also essential to consider the implications for students' freedom of expression and online freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of social media monitoring is a nuanced one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. As we navigate the complexities of online interactions, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of our actions and the importance of balancing individual rights with the need for student safety.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and I must admit that discussing it makes me feel uncomfortable. Reflecting on my own stance, I realize that I initially opposed the invasion, aligning with the prevailing public opinion at the time. However, the ongoing debate has led me to question the war's validity. A significant majority of global citizens, including Iraqis and U.S. troops stationed in the region, share my initial concerns. According to various polls, roughly 75-80% of the international community believes the invasion was a misguided decision.\n\nThe complexities of the situation are evident when considering the cultural and historical context of the Middle East. The significant cultural disparities between the U.S. and the region create a challenging environment for implementing democracy. It's essential to acknowledge that the people of Iraq would have chosen a different approach to governance, rather than one imposed by an external force.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a problematic leader, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons before embarking on a costly and potentially disastrous intervention. The consequences of the invasion have been severe, and the ongoing occupation has created a seemingly intractable situation.\n\nI'm not convinced by the administration's arguments for continued involvement. While they may have valid concerns about the potential consequences of a hasty withdrawal, I'm yet to be persuaded by their reasoning. A gradual exit strategy over the course of a year or more might be a more viable option. However, I struggle to see a compelling argument for prolonging the occupation.\n\nA striking statistic I encountered highlights the sentiment of the Iraqi people: a significant majority believes that the U.S. should leave within the year, with some even advocating for an immediate withdrawal. As we claim to be intervening to help the Iraqi people, it's worth considering their perspective and potential solutions that prioritize their needs and desires.\n\nUltimately, even if we were to withdraw, we could still maintain a relationship with the Iraqi people and attempt to rectify any harm caused. This approach would at least ensure that we're not exacerbating the situation and could potentially be seen as a more humanitarian gesture. However, it's essential to acknowledge that our actions in the Middle East have not been without controversy, and it's uncertain whether we can ever fully be viewed as benevolent actors in the region.",
            "While it's undeniable that progress has been made in reducing inequality, I firmly believe that the United States still grapples with significant gender biases. It's essential to acknowledge that these prejudices can manifest differently depending on the specific industry and societal context.\n\nIn the professional sphere, the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where women face difficulties in advancing to leadership positions, persists. Despite having the necessary qualifications, women often encounter resistance to their promotion due to deeply ingrained societal expectations. This bias is not limited to women; men in traditionally masculine fields like business and industry may also face challenges. For instance, a male staying at home with children may be met with skepticism, as societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\n\nSimilarly, in the fashion industry, there's a tendency to dismiss men who are passionate about fashion, assuming that their interests are not truly authentic. This attitude can be attributed to a narrow understanding of masculinity and the expectation that men should conform to traditional norms.\n\nEfforts to combat these biases are hindered by the deeply ingrained nature of these attitudes. However, there are signs of progress, such as women rising to leadership positions and increasing acceptance of stay-at-home dads. To accelerate change, it's crucial to promote the qualities and achievements of individuals who defy traditional stereotypes, rather than forcing them upon others. A delicate balance must be struck between pushing for progress and avoiding resistance.\n\nInterestingly, biases can also manifest across different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations. For instance, an individual from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those with more refined communication skills, despite being highly intelligent and capable. This highlights the complexity of the issue, which extends beyond gender to include factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to recognize that overcoming these biases will require a sustained effort and a nuanced understanding of the various factors at play.",
            "My understanding is that the substance in question has undergone a significant transformation in the legal sphere. While it was previously considered a criminal offense, it has been decriminalized, essentially relegating it to a fine-able infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change eliminates the need for arrests, court appearances, and the associated costs that come with them. However, the ramifications of being caught with the substance still persist, particularly in terms of job prospects and social implications.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of decriminalization is the financial aspect. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for the substance is costly, and the resources allocated to this endeavor could be redirected towards more pressing community needs. Municipalities grappling with financial constraints may be hesitant to adopt such a policy, even if it would yield significant financial benefits.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, has taken a more progressive stance, and the city has reportedly seen a substantial increase in available funds for public education, social programs, and other community initiatives. While it's essential to consider the potential consequences of widespread use, the financial benefits of decriminalization cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the substance's potential impact on society is multifaceted. While some may view it as a relatively benign substance, others may be uncomfortable with its presence in public spaces. The fear of impaired driving and the ongoing stigma surrounding the substance's use are valid concerns.\n\nThe effects of the substance vary greatly from person to person, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about its impact. Some individuals may be able to moderate their use, while others may struggle with its consequences. Both the substance in question and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with nuance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize the substance is a complex one, influenced by a range of factors, including personal attitudes, societal norms, and financial considerations.",
            "While I agree with many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that adaptability to change is essential. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, but it's equally important to ensure that these customs don't hinder its ability to grow and evolve. \n\nOne area where the Catholic Church's strict adherence to doctrine and tradition can be problematic is in its stance on interfaith relationships. For instance, my parents, one a practicing Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This experience made me realize that the Church's exclusivity can sometimes lead to a lack of tolerance for those who don't conform to its teachings.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between Catholic doctrine and practice is another area of concern. The Church's emphasis on love and acceptance is contradicted by its refusal to accept those who don't meet its standards. This paradox can be jarring, especially when considering the long history of the Church.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that marriage could help prevent instances of misconduct, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that often involves a pattern of behavior rather than a specific circumstance. Therefore, I'm not sure that allowing priests to marry would be a deterrent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's traditional approach can be both a strength and a weakness. While its commitment to its teachings is admirable, it's essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of its strict adherence to doctrine and tradition. By acknowledging these complexities, the Church can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach.",
            "The issue at hand presents a complex challenge, as it navigates the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. This dichotomy is particularly tricky to resolve without alienating certain groups. Ultimately, my stance on the matter remains unclear, as I find it difficult to definitively assert the legitimacy of either perspective.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the distinction between marriage and civil unions is a crucial point of contention. The fact that civil unions confer similar benefits to those of marriage, such as tax advantages, suggests that the government should not dictate the legitimacy of a union based on its religious connotations. In essence, a civil union merely represents a legally recognized partnership between two individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nIf we were to view marriage solely as a civil institution, we could avoid conflating church and state. This would also enable the government to focus on the practical aspects of marriage, such as the union of two individuals, rather than its spiritual or religious undertones. Consequently, the legalization of gay marriage would not be a contentious issue, as it would be recognized as a civil union, akin to any other.\n\nIf a consensus is reached among the states, it would be reasonable to push for federal legislation to codify this understanding. However, I strongly believe that banning gay marriage by way of a constitutional amendment is an extreme measure. The Constitution should not be amended to address a matter of such limited significance, particularly when it would disproportionately affect a minority group.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of gay marriage should not be elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment. It is not a matter of sufficient magnitude to warrant such a drastic measure, and it is essential to maintain a separation between church and state to ensure that the government does not impose its values on its citizens.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have often grappled with the complexities of the LGBTQ+ community. While my upbringing has informed my views, it has also led me to appreciate the diversity of perspectives within this issue. My friends who identify as gay have shown me the importance of understanding and empathy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their personal lives, free from undue influence from the federal government. I think that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach acknowledges the differences in cultural values and societal norms that exist between various regions.\n\nI recognize that some states, particularly those with a predominantly democratic lean, may be more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights. However, I also believe that individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local values and decisions that come with that choice.\n\nWhile the current federal ban on gay marriage has been a topic of controversy, I think it's essential to consider the implications of a federal decision on the lives of individuals. In my opinion, the president's role should be to ensure that each state has the freedom to make its own decisions, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe changing landscape of U.S. politics, including the upcoming presidential election, underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. Rather than relying on a federal mandate, I believe that states should have the authority to decide what works best for their communities. This approach would allow for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that each state should have the autonomy to make its own decisions regarding same-sex marriage, rather than deferring to the federal government. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "When considering the implications of school officials monitoring student online activity, it's essential to acknowledge that social media platforms like Myspace are, by definition, public spaces. As such, any information posted on these platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. In the context of preventing potential harm, such as school shootings, it's reasonable to assume that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety.\n\nIn this light, if school officials discover content on Myspace that indicates students are engaging in illicit behavior, it's not an invasion of privacy if they take action to address the issue. In fact, it's a necessary step in maintaining a secure learning environment. This approach is analogous to the measures taken in schools to prepare for potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness.\n\nFor instance, my own high school experience involved regular lockdown drills and safety protocols, which were implemented in response to national security concerns, including the possibility of terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to school shootings, the underlying principle is the same: to create a safe and secure environment for students.\n\nIn the specific case of school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and create a safer school environment. While some might view this as an invasion of privacy, it's essential to weigh this against the potential consequences of inaction. By taking proactive steps to address potential threats, school officials can help prevent incidents like the Columbine shooting.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring student online activity is complex and multifaceted. However, when considering the potential consequences of inaction, it's clear that proactive measures to ensure student safety are justified.",
            "The events following the catastrophic events of 9/11 had a profound impact on America's foreign policy. Initially, I was in favor of taking a proactive approach to address the threat posed by terrorism. However, as time passed, I began to question the strategic decisions made by our government. It is my opinion that the war in Iraq was fought without a clear plan or a thorough understanding of the consequences. The emotional response to 9/11 led to a hasty decision-making process that prioritized immediate action over long-term strategy.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the local culture. Our military intervention was met with resistance, and the conflict escalated. The war in Iraq has been a protracted and costly endeavor that has yielded limited progress. I now question the effectiveness of our presence in the region.\n\nOne of the primary concerns I have is that our efforts have not led to lasting stability in Iraq. The ongoing conflict between various factions has hindered our ability to make a meaningful impact. I firmly believe that as long as these groups are engaged in internal power struggles, they will be unable to focus on external threats, including those posed by the United States. In my opinion, our continued involvement in the conflict is not a viable solution.\n\nMoreover, I think it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of war differs significantly between Western and Middle Eastern cultures. The aftermath of war in Iraq has been marked by chaos, and I fear that our military presence has only exacerbated the situation. It appears to me that the primary objective of our involvement was to remove Saddam Hussein from power, rather than to establish a stable and self-sufficient government.\n\nA more considered approach might have yielded better results. A more nuanced understanding of the local dynamics and a clear plan for our objectives could have led to a more effective and sustainable resolution. In my opinion, the war in Iraq was a product of a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy.\n\nLooking back, I believe that our involvement in Iraq has been a costly and misguided endeavor. We should have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing diplomacy and international cooperation over military intervention. In the end, I think our continued presence in the region is not a solution, but rather a cause of further instability."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church is facing a decline in its following, and one of the possible reasons for this trend may be its stance on certain issues. The Church's views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have been a point of contention for some people. These issues might be seen as outdated and not in line with the evolving values of society.\n\nThe Church's strict views on these matters may be alienating individuals who hold different opinions. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable joining a community that considers these practices morally wrong. Similarly, individuals who believe in the importance of marriage equality or reproductive freedom may feel that the Church's stance on these issues is too restrictive.\n\nMoreover, the Church's refusal to ordain women as priests and its requirement that priests remain celibate may be seen as limiting and outdated. While the Church views its priests as being devoted to God, it is hard to understand why they cannot have a family life like other professionals. It is reasonable to assume that having a spouse and children might not necessarily lead to a change in their work, just as it does not for many people in other careers.\n\nThe Church's adamant stance on certain issues might be driving away individuals who are looking for a more inclusive and accepting community. As a result, it is essential for the Church to re-evaluate its views and adapt to the changing values of society. By doing so, it may be possible to prevent further decline in its following and attract individuals who share its values but also expect a more nuanced approach to complex issues.",
            "The topic of same-sex marriage has garnered significant attention in recent years, with varying opinions on whether it should be recognized by law. From my perspective, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. It seems that one's sexual orientation is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of a person's identity.\n\nWhile I may not have extensively explored this topic, my stance is clear: I do not agree that the government should dictate who can and cannot get married based on their sexual orientation. I believe that this decision should be left to the individuals involved and those who care about them.\n\nThere is a misconception that people are born straight or gay, but the reality is that it's a complex issue that cannot be reduced to simple labels. However, I do believe that individuals should not be judged or penalized for who they are. The government's role in regulating marriage is not only unnecessary but also intrusive.\n\nIn my opinion, the government's involvement in same-sex marriage is not a matter of national security or moral values, but rather a personal matter that should be left to the individuals involved. It's essential to respect people's autonomy and allow them to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of persecution or judgment.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the federal government should not be involved in deciding who can get married and who cannot. This decision should be made by the individuals and those who care about them, not by the government. By doing so, we can promote a more accepting and inclusive society where everyone can live freely and authentically.",
            "The legalization of same-sex marriage has been a contentious issue for quite some time. However, as I've researched and considered the topic, I firmly believe that it's time for the federal government to reevaluate its stance on this matter. The primary reason for this is that there are numerous studies that demonstrate the similarities between same-sex relationships and traditional marriages. These studies indicate that both have the same factors contributing to relationship satisfaction, such as commitment, trust, and communication.\n\nOne of the most compelling arguments against same-sex marriage is the notion that it poses a threat to the traditional family unit. However, this argument is based on a misconception that same-sex couples are fundamentally different from heterosexual couples. In reality, the dynamics of same-sex relationships are not significantly different from those of opposite-sex relationships. Both involve individuals forming emotional bonds, making long-term commitments, and contributing to their partner's well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the notion that same-sex couples are seeking to marry in a church is a misconception. They are, in fact, seeking a legal recognition of their relationship in the form of a marriage certificate, a document issued by the government. By separating church and state, we can resolve the issue of religious disagreement and focus on the legal implications of marriage.\n\nThe concept of \"separate but equal\" is often used to describe the current system of civil unions, but this is a flawed analogy. In reality, same-sex couples are not being treated equally, as they are denied the same rights and benefits as their heterosexual counterparts. This is evident in the areas of property taxes, healthcare, and adoption.\n\nOne of the concerns surrounding same-sex marriage is the impact on children. However, research suggests that children raised by same-sex parents are no more or less likely to experience difficulties than those raised by opposite-sex parents. In fact, children of same-sex parents often face unique challenges, such as bullying and social stigma, which can be mitigated by providing support and education to the community.\n\nThe federal government should play a more active role in addressing these issues and promoting equality for all citizens. By making same-sex marriage legal in every state, we can ensure that all individuals are treated with dignity and respect. The idea that morality is negotiable is a complex issue, and it's essential to consider the diverse perspectives and values of our society. By embracing diversity and inclusivity, we can create a more just and equitable society.\n\nIt's also essential to acknowledge the impact of misinformation and prejudice on public opinion. Many people base their opinions on misconceptions and stereotypes rather than evidence-based research. By promoting education and awareness, we can work towards a more informed and empathetic society.\n\nUltimately, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be based on the principles of equality, justice, and human rights. By recognizing the inherent value and dignity of all individuals, we can create a more compassionate and inclusive society.",
            "When evaluating the availability of medicinal substances, it's crucial to separate the issue from societal stigmas. Working in a hospital pharmacy during the summer has given me a unique perspective on this matter. While certain substances may be prohibited due to their potential for abuse, their therapeutic benefits should not be dismissed outright.\n\nFor instance, many controlled substances that are illegal in their unregulated form are still used in pharmacies to treat a range of conditions. Medications like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are just a few examples of controlled substances with proven medical value. Their benefits cannot be ignored solely because of their illicit status.\n\nSimilarly, marijuana possesses medicinal properties that warrant consideration. The fact that it is often associated with negative connotations should not overshadow its potential benefits. If we can differentiate between the substance itself and its potential for abuse, we can begin to reevaluate its role in healthcare.\n\nTo address concerns about responsible use, a gradual approach to legalization could be more effective than a sudden change. By removing the stigma surrounding marijuana, we may foster a more informed and responsible attitude towards its use.\n\nThe misconception surrounding marijuana stems from its reputation as an illicit substance. However, this perception is not entirely accurate. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively moderate. By reframing our understanding of marijuana, we may be able to promote more responsible use and its integration into medical practices.\n\nUltimately, a nuanced approach to substance regulation can help us make more informed decisions about the role of marijuana in healthcare.",
            "While reflecting on the evolution of my childhood church, I've observed a noticeable shift towards a more contemporary and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms; instead, the church has adapted to the 21st century's changing values. Sundays now observe a more casual dress code, with attendees often sporting jeans and casual wear, especially during the summer months. This shift is particularly evident in the condensed 30-minute masses, which cater to the busy lives of young families.\n\nAs I reminisce about my own experiences at a private school, I recall the weekly ritual of attending church with my friends. We'd dress up in our Sunday best, complete with matching outfits and accessories. However, even back then, the church was evolving, and this gradual change has continued over the years.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations against Catholic priests, I believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one. While some argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I disagree. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that transcends societal norms and religious affiliations. Statistics show that married individuals can still struggle with these impulses, and it's ultimately a matter of personal choice rather than a symptom of their marital status.\n\nIn fact, some denominations that allow their clergy to marry, such as certain Protestant churches, still struggle with these issues. It's essential to recognize that pedophilia is often a product of genetic predisposition and not a result of upbringing or environment. While genetic factors may play a significant role, it's also crucial to acknowledge that individuals with these tendencies often try to conceal them, even through marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church's adaptation to modern times is noteworthy, I don't believe that changes in their policies would have prevented the recent scandals. It's essential to address the root causes of these issues and hold those responsible accountable, rather than placing blame on the institution itself.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially had reservations about the premise, which I believe was largely overshadowed by the lingering sentiments following the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration used the threat of Iraq as a pretext for invasion, fueled by claims linking Saddam Hussein to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, which have since been discredited. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me, as it suggests a blatant disregard for the truth and a willingness to manipulate public opinion.\n\nThe Bush administration's propensity for deception has been a recurring theme throughout their tenure, with even high-ranking officials like Colin Powell later expressing doubts about the evidence they presented at the time. This raises serious questions about the administration's commitment to transparency and accountability. The notion that they have consistently disregarded constitutional principles, particularly in the post-9/11 era, is troubling.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Bush administration's motives for invading Iraq were likely multifaceted, with some speculating that the younger Bush sought to expand the country's energy resources, a goal that was allegedly influenced by his father's administration. This underhanded approach to governance is concerning, particularly given the devastating consequences of the war.\n\nWhile I believe the conflict has dragged on for far too long, a hasty withdrawal could lead to a power vacuum, potentially resulting in civil war and increased casualties. The proposed solution, involving a coalition of regional nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be the most effective approach, as it could further erode Iraq's sovereignty and create new challenges for the country's fragile government. The Iraqi Parliament's ineffectiveness and the influence of radical elements like Muqtada al-Sadr's party only exacerbate these concerns.\n\nUltimately, the complex situation in Iraq has left me searching for a clear and effective solution, but one that balances the need for stability with the importance of respecting the country's sovereignty and promoting accountability within the political process.",
            "When considering the complexities of the Iraq War, my thoughts are multifaceted and influenced by various factors. It's essential to acknowledge that the conflict was not officially declared by Congress, which raises questions about its legitimacy. At the same time, it's crucial to remember that the initial motivations behind the war were in response to the 9/11 attacks, which were perpetrated by terrorists believed to have ties to Iraq.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that the war has become a protracted and complex issue, with multiple factors at play. The primary goal of establishing democracy in Iraq has been a driving force behind our continued presence, but it's also clear that this process is a long-term endeavor that cannot be accomplished overnight. Moreover, the war has resulted in significant human suffering and loss, including the displacement of families and the disruption of communities.\n\nOne of the most significant challenges in addressing this issue is the cultural divide between our societies. While it's essential to acknowledge the right to self-determination, our attempts to impose our values and system on Iraq may ultimately exacerbate the problem. This could lead to a deepening hatred towards the United States and the proliferation of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda.\n\nIn my opinion, the war has become a quagmire that will continue to plague us for years to come. It's essential to carefully consider the long-term consequences of our actions and to reevaluate our goals and strategies. While it's difficult to provide a clear solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is necessary, one that takes into account the complexities of the conflict and the cultural and historical context of Iraq.\n\nUltimately, the war in Iraq presents a complex web of issues that require thoughtful consideration and a multifaceted approach. It's essential to engage in a national dialogue that takes into account the various perspectives and interests at play, with the goal of finding a path forward that promotes peace, stability, and the well-being of the Iraqi people.",
            "The concept of government intervention in matters of religious freedom has long been a contentious issue in the United States. The First Amendment, with its explicit mention of the separation of church and state, serves as a cornerstone for the nation's commitment to religious tolerance. However, there are those who advocate for government involvement in regulating the practices of various faiths.\n\nIn my opinion, such an approach is misguided and contravenes the principles enshrined in the Constitution. By attempting to impose its will on matters of faith, the government would be overstepping its authority and infringing upon the rights of religious institutions. The Constitution's Founding Fathers deliberately established a framework that ensures the separation of church and state, allowing for the free exercise of religion without interference from the government.\n\nMoreover, the notion that the government should dictate what is permissible in a particular faith is a slippery slope. It would inevitably lead to favoritism, where the government would be choosing one denomination over another, potentially stifling the diversity of religious expression that is so essential to American society. The example of Catholic and Christian opposition to this particular issue in certain regions highlights the potential for favoritism and the danger of government overreach.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of American democracy, allowing for the coexistence of various faiths in harmony. Any attempt to undermine this fundamental aspect of the Constitution would be a step backward, potentially restricting the rights of individuals and institutions rather than protecting them. In light of this, I believe it is essential to maintain the status quo and allow religious institutions to govern themselves, free from government interference.\n\nThe motivation behind government intervention in this matter appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good. The potential consequences of such an amendment would be far-reaching, and it is uncertain how it would impact the economy or society as a whole. It is crucial to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal opinions to dictate policy.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that the government should refrain from intervening in matters of faith, allowing religious institutions to operate freely and autonomously. The Constitution's founders wisely established a framework that prioritizes individual freedom and diversity, and it is our duty to uphold these principles and preserve the integrity of our democracy.",
            "The Iraq War has left a lasting impact on the world, and I believe the US government's motives for invading Iraq were not entirely transparent. Many people felt that the administration used the 9/11 attacks as a justification for war, despite the lack of a clear connection between the two events. This raised questions about the government's honesty with the American people. \n\nPersonally, I am strongly opposed to preemptive war, and I believe that the invasion of Iraq followed a pattern similar to the Vietnam War. Both conflicts involved an attempt to impose democracy on a foreign nation, which often results in a complex and challenging process. The removal of a country's government can lead to chaos and instability, and I think the US government underestimated the difficulty of rebuilding a new government in Iraq.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been significant, with many American lives lost. I believe that the administration failed to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, including the power vacuum that would be left by the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime. This lack of planning has led to ongoing instability and violence in the region.\n\nThe idea of spreading democracy is admirable, but it's a difficult and time-consuming process. Implementing a new form of government requires patience, understanding, and a deep knowledge of the local culture. In our own country, democracy was not established overnight, and it took many years of struggle and conflict to achieve.\n\nThe war in Iraq has also raised questions about the role of the US in global politics. I think the government's actions were motivated by a desire to control resources, particularly oil. The lack of clear evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq has led to accusations that the administration was not truthful in its decision-making process.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue, and the US government's actions have had far-reaching consequences. I hope that the conflict will eventually come to an end and that a lasting peace will be established in the region. However, I fear that this may not be the case.",
            "My stance on gay marriage has been consistent - I firmly support the right to same-sex unions. I believe this is a matter of personal preference, and recent scientific discoveries have shown that sexuality can be influenced by biological factors rather than solely by societal influences. It's hard to justify denying individuals their rights due to something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's essential to separate politics and government from personal choices, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. Marriage is a deeply personal commitment that should not be subject to external regulations. In fact, seeing same-sex couples in my neighborhood, who live and interact like any other family, has only strengthened my conviction.\n\nThe notion that politicians, like the previous administration, try to impose their interpretation of marriage on the public is not only misguided but also an overreach of power. I believe that marriage should be a private matter between two consenting adults, not a topic for public debate or scrutiny.\n\nResearch has shown that genetic and biological factors can contribute to an individual's sexual orientation. For instance, studies suggest that some people may be predisposed to be homosexual, regardless of their upbringing or environment. This further emphasizes the importance of accepting and respecting people's choices, rather than trying to justify discrimination.\n\nIn my opinion, the distinction between gay and heterosexual couples seeking marriage should not be a public spectacle. If a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so privately, without drawing attention to themselves. Conversely, if a same-sex couple wants to formalize their relationship, it's not right that it becomes a media sensation. This highlights the need to treat all relationships with equal respect and avoid making them the subject of public scrutiny.",
            "The internet has a unique characteristic that sets it apart from other forms of communication: its inherent public nature. As we've seen firsthand in our community, postings made online can have far-reaching consequences. As a Residential Advisor, I've had to navigate this issue personally, and it's a valuable lesson I've learned.\n\nWhen individuals share information online, they must consider the potential impact on their reputation. Sharing sensitive or inflammatory content can lead to misinterpretation and garner unwanted attention. This is particularly concerning when discussing topics like violence or threats, which can be misinterpreted or taken out of context. In such cases, school authorities often feel compelled to act, as they have a responsibility to ensure student safety.\n\nThe proliferation of social media has made it increasingly difficult to discern what's genuine and what's not. It's not uncommon for people to post humorous or thought-provoking content that's later misinterpreted or taken seriously. In one instance, a situation arose on our campus when a student's online posting was misinterpreted, leading to a thorough investigation. The individual in question had posted content that, in hindsight, may have been intended as a joke, but it sparked concern and warranted a closer look.\n\nThe internet's lack of inherent privacy is a critical aspect of online interactions. If an individual chooses to share information online, they should be prepared for it to be accessed by others. This includes school officials, who may be alerted to concerning content by students or parents. While it's essential to respect students' online autonomy, school authorities have a responsibility to act when they become aware of potential threats or dangers.\n\nIn terms of monitoring online activity, I believe it's crucial to strike a balance between respecting students' online lives and protecting their safety. While I don't think school officials should engage in extensive surveillance, I do believe that they have a right to address concerns brought to their attention. This can be done by working with the individual or their parents to address the issue.\n\nUltimately, it's essential for individuals to be mindful of their online presence and the potential consequences of their actions. As a Residential Advisor, I strive to educate my residents about the importance of responsible online behavior and the potential impact of their online actions on their reputation and well-being.",
            "The war has been prolonged for an unnecessarily extensive period, raising concerns about its original objectives. Initially, the intention to establish democracy in another country seemed justifiable, particularly considering the absence of a fair political system. However, it appears that the purpose has become increasingly distorted over time.\n\nOne cannot help but wonder if the war was instigated by personal grievances of the past, such as the complex history between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the primary goal was to introduce democracy, it would have been a commendable endeavor, but the presence of personal agendas would have tainted the mission.\n\nIt seems that the initial momentum was sufficient to convey a strong message, particularly in the early stages of the conflict. Nevertheless, the war has persisted for an inordinate amount of time, with the continuation of hostilities becoming increasingly questionable.\n\nIf the primary objective was to topple a tyrannical regime and introduce democracy, that would have been a noble pursuit. However, it appears that the motivations have become muddled over time, and the war has become an end in itself rather than a means to an end.\n\nThe war has been waged for an excessive duration, and it is high time for a conclusion. The government of the invaded country must eventually be self-sufficient, and it is likely that this point has already been reached. The financial burden of the war is substantial, with billions of dollars being diverted from domestic issues such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare.\n\nThe allocation of funds to a foreign conflict that has lost its original purpose is a concern, particularly when domestic problems are left unaddressed. The money spent on the war could be better utilized to address pressing issues within the country, such as education, healthcare, and public services.",
            "The question of whether schools should monitor students' online activities is a complex issue. While some may argue that privacy is compromised when individuals share personal information online, it's essential to consider the context in which this information is shared.\n\nWhen users post content on social media platforms like Myspace, they are, in effect, granting permission to a select group of individuals to view their profiles. This can include friends, classmates, and even acquaintances. While this may seem like an invasion of privacy on the surface, it's essential to recognize that individuals have some control over who can view their content.\n\nHowever, this raises the question of whether monitoring students' online activities is a viable solution to prevent potential threats. While it's unrealistic to expect a single individual to constantly monitor every student's profile, it's also difficult to justify discriminating against certain groups of students based on their online behavior.\n\nUltimately, the line between monitoring and surveillance is blurred. While some may argue that monitoring is necessary to prevent potential harm, others believe that it's an invasion of students' rights. The scenario where someone uses online information to prevent a life from being lost raises important questions about the role of social media in ensuring student safety.\n\nPersonally, having a social media presence can be both beneficial and detrimental. On one hand, it allows individuals to connect with friends and maintain relationships. On the other hand, it can also expose users to potential risks, such as online harassment or stalking. As someone who uses Facebook, I'm aware of the importance of being cautious when sharing personal information online.\n\nA recent incident I saw on TV highlighted the ease with which individuals can gather information about others online. This raised concerns about the potential consequences of sharing personal details, such as screen names and class schedules, on social media. However, I also recognize the value of social media in maintaining relationships and staying connected with friends.\n\nThe issue of social media monitoring in schools is another area of concern. In some cases, schools have banned students from having Myspace accounts, sparking questions about the extent of their authority to regulate students' online activities. While this may be seen as a way to ensure student safety, it's also essential to consider the implications for students' freedom of expression and online freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of social media monitoring is a nuanced one, and there are valid arguments on both sides. As we navigate the complexities of online interactions, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of our actions and the importance of balancing individual rights with the need for student safety.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and I must admit that discussing it makes me feel uncomfortable. Reflecting on my own stance, I realize that I initially opposed the invasion, aligning with the prevailing public opinion at the time. However, the ongoing debate has led me to question the war's validity. A significant majority of global citizens, including Iraqis and U.S. troops stationed in the region, share my initial concerns. According to various polls, roughly 75-80% of the international community believes the invasion was a misguided decision.\n\nThe complexities of the situation are evident when considering the cultural and historical context of the Middle East. The significant cultural disparities between the U.S. and the region create a challenging environment for implementing democracy. It's essential to acknowledge that the people of Iraq would have chosen a different approach to governance, rather than one imposed by an external force.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a problematic leader, it's crucial to weigh the pros and cons before embarking on a costly and potentially disastrous intervention. The consequences of the invasion have been severe, and the ongoing occupation has created a seemingly intractable situation.\n\nI'm not convinced by the administration's arguments for continued involvement. While they may have valid concerns about the potential consequences of a hasty withdrawal, I'm yet to be persuaded by their reasoning. A gradual exit strategy over the course of a year or more might be a more viable option. However, I struggle to see a compelling argument for prolonging the occupation.\n\nA striking statistic I encountered highlights the sentiment of the Iraqi people: a significant majority believes that the U.S. should leave within the year, with some even advocating for an immediate withdrawal. As we claim to be intervening to help the Iraqi people, it's worth considering their perspective and potential solutions that prioritize their needs and desires.\n\nUltimately, even if we were to withdraw, we could still maintain a relationship with the Iraqi people and attempt to rectify any harm caused. This approach would at least ensure that we're not exacerbating the situation and could potentially be seen as a more humanitarian gesture. However, it's essential to acknowledge that our actions in the Middle East have not been without controversy, and it's uncertain whether we can ever fully be viewed as benevolent actors in the region.",
            "While it's undeniable that progress has been made in reducing inequality, I firmly believe that the United States still grapples with significant gender biases. It's essential to acknowledge that these prejudices can manifest differently depending on the specific industry and societal context.\n\nIn the professional sphere, the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where women face difficulties in advancing to leadership positions, persists. Despite having the necessary qualifications, women often encounter resistance to their promotion due to deeply ingrained societal expectations. This bias is not limited to women; men in traditionally masculine fields like business and industry may also face challenges. For instance, a male staying at home with children may be met with skepticism, as societal norms dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\n\nSimilarly, in the fashion industry, there's a tendency to dismiss men who are passionate about fashion, assuming that their interests are not truly authentic. This attitude can be attributed to a narrow understanding of masculinity and the expectation that men should conform to traditional norms.\n\nEfforts to combat these biases are hindered by the deeply ingrained nature of these attitudes. However, there are signs of progress, such as women rising to leadership positions and increasing acceptance of stay-at-home dads. To accelerate change, it's crucial to promote the qualities and achievements of individuals who defy traditional stereotypes, rather than forcing them upon others. A delicate balance must be struck between pushing for progress and avoiding resistance.\n\nInterestingly, biases can also manifest across different socioeconomic backgrounds and geographic locations. For instance, an individual from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those with more refined communication skills, despite being highly intelligent and capable. This highlights the complexity of the issue, which extends beyond gender to include factors like socioeconomic status and geographical location.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to recognize that overcoming these biases will require a sustained effort and a nuanced understanding of the various factors at play.",
            "My understanding is that the substance in question has undergone a significant transformation in the legal sphere. While it was previously considered a criminal offense, it has been decriminalized, essentially relegating it to a fine-able infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change eliminates the need for arrests, court appearances, and the associated costs that come with them. However, the ramifications of being caught with the substance still persist, particularly in terms of job prospects and social implications.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of decriminalization is the financial aspect. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for the substance is costly, and the resources allocated to this endeavor could be redirected towards more pressing community needs. Municipalities grappling with financial constraints may be hesitant to adopt such a policy, even if it would yield significant financial benefits.\n\nDenver, on the other hand, has taken a more progressive stance, and the city has reportedly seen a substantial increase in available funds for public education, social programs, and other community initiatives. While it's essential to consider the potential consequences of widespread use, the financial benefits of decriminalization cannot be overlooked.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the substance's potential impact on society is multifaceted. While some may view it as a relatively benign substance, others may be uncomfortable with its presence in public spaces. The fear of impaired driving and the ongoing stigma surrounding the substance's use are valid concerns.\n\nThe effects of the substance vary greatly from person to person, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about its impact. Some individuals may be able to moderate their use, while others may struggle with its consequences. Both the substance in question and alcohol have their own set of adverse effects, and it's essential to approach the topic with nuance.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize the substance is a complex one, influenced by a range of factors, including personal attitudes, societal norms, and financial considerations.",
            "While I agree with many traditional aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that adaptability to change is essential. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, but it's equally important to ensure that these customs don't hinder its ability to grow and evolve. \n\nOne area where the Catholic Church's strict adherence to doctrine and tradition can be problematic is in its stance on interfaith relationships. For instance, my parents, one a practicing Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to get married in the Catholic Church due to their differing faiths. This experience made me realize that the Church's exclusivity can sometimes lead to a lack of tolerance for those who don't conform to its teachings.\n\nThe apparent disconnect between Catholic doctrine and practice is another area of concern. The Church's emphasis on love and acceptance is contradicted by its refusal to accept those who don't meet its standards. This paradox can be jarring, especially when considering the long history of the Church.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being allowed to marry, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that marriage could help prevent instances of misconduct, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that often involves a pattern of behavior rather than a specific circumstance. Therefore, I'm not sure that allowing priests to marry would be a deterrent.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's traditional approach can be both a strength and a weakness. While its commitment to its teachings is admirable, it's essential to recognize the potential drawbacks of its strict adherence to doctrine and tradition. By acknowledging these complexities, the Church can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate approach.",
            "The issue at hand presents a complex challenge, as it navigates the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. This dichotomy is particularly tricky to resolve without alienating certain groups. Ultimately, my stance on the matter remains unclear, as I find it difficult to definitively assert the legitimacy of either perspective.\n\nHowever, I do believe that the distinction between marriage and civil unions is a crucial point of contention. The fact that civil unions confer similar benefits to those of marriage, such as tax advantages, suggests that the government should not dictate the legitimacy of a union based on its religious connotations. In essence, a civil union merely represents a legally recognized partnership between two individuals, irrespective of their religious affiliations.\n\nIf we were to view marriage solely as a civil institution, we could avoid conflating church and state. This would also enable the government to focus on the practical aspects of marriage, such as the union of two individuals, rather than its spiritual or religious undertones. Consequently, the legalization of gay marriage would not be a contentious issue, as it would be recognized as a civil union, akin to any other.\n\nIf a consensus is reached among the states, it would be reasonable to push for federal legislation to codify this understanding. However, I strongly believe that banning gay marriage by way of a constitutional amendment is an extreme measure. The Constitution should not be amended to address a matter of such limited significance, particularly when it would disproportionately affect a minority group.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of gay marriage should not be elevated to the level of a constitutional amendment. It is not a matter of sufficient magnitude to warrant such a drastic measure, and it is essential to maintain a separation between church and state to ensure that the government does not impose its values on its citizens.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have often grappled with the complexities of the LGBTQ+ community. While my upbringing has informed my views, it has also led me to appreciate the diversity of perspectives within this issue. My friends who identify as gay have shown me the importance of understanding and empathy.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make choices about their personal lives, free from undue influence from the federal government. I think that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach acknowledges the differences in cultural values and societal norms that exist between various regions.\n\nI recognize that some states, particularly those with a predominantly democratic lean, may be more likely to support LGBTQ+ rights. However, I also believe that individuals who choose to live in a particular state should respect the local values and decisions that come with that choice.\n\nWhile the current federal ban on gay marriage has been a topic of controversy, I think it's essential to consider the implications of a federal decision on the lives of individuals. In my opinion, the president's role should be to ensure that each state has the freedom to make its own decisions, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nThe changing landscape of U.S. politics, including the upcoming presidential election, underscores the need for a more nuanced approach to this issue. Rather than relying on a federal mandate, I believe that states should have the authority to decide what works best for their communities. This approach would allow for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to the LGBTQ+ community.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that each state should have the autonomy to make its own decisions regarding same-sex marriage, rather than deferring to the federal government. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive and respectful environment for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.",
            "When considering the implications of school officials monitoring student online activity, it's essential to acknowledge that social media platforms like Myspace are, by definition, public spaces. As such, any information posted on these platforms can be accessed by anyone, including school officials. In the context of preventing potential harm, such as school shootings, it's reasonable to assume that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety.\n\nIn this light, if school officials discover content on Myspace that indicates students are engaging in illicit behavior, it's not an invasion of privacy if they take action to address the issue. In fact, it's a necessary step in maintaining a secure learning environment. This approach is analogous to the measures taken in schools to prepare for potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency preparedness.\n\nFor instance, my own high school experience involved regular lockdown drills and safety protocols, which were implemented in response to national security concerns, including the possibility of terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to school shootings, the underlying principle is the same: to create a safe and secure environment for students.\n\nIn the specific case of school officials monitoring Myspace, their actions are motivated by a desire to prevent harm and create a safer school environment. While some might view this as an invasion of privacy, it's essential to weigh this against the potential consequences of inaction. By taking proactive steps to address potential threats, school officials can help prevent incidents like the Columbine shooting.\n\nUltimately, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring student online activity is complex and multifaceted. However, when considering the potential consequences of inaction, it's clear that proactive measures to ensure student safety are justified.",
            "The events following the catastrophic events of 9/11 had a profound impact on America's foreign policy. Initially, I was in favor of taking a proactive approach to address the threat posed by terrorism. However, as time passed, I began to question the strategic decisions made by our government. It is my opinion that the war in Iraq was fought without a clear plan or a thorough understanding of the consequences. The emotional response to 9/11 led to a hasty decision-making process that prioritized immediate action over long-term strategy.\n\nIn hindsight, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the local culture. Our military intervention was met with resistance, and the conflict escalated. The war in Iraq has been a protracted and costly endeavor that has yielded limited progress. I now question the effectiveness of our presence in the region.\n\nOne of the primary concerns I have is that our efforts have not led to lasting stability in Iraq. The ongoing conflict between various factions has hindered our ability to make a meaningful impact. I firmly believe that as long as these groups are engaged in internal power struggles, they will be unable to focus on external threats, including those posed by the United States. In my opinion, our continued involvement in the conflict is not a viable solution.\n\nMoreover, I think it is essential to acknowledge that the concept of war differs significantly between Western and Middle Eastern cultures. The aftermath of war in Iraq has been marked by chaos, and I fear that our military presence has only exacerbated the situation. It appears to me that the primary objective of our involvement was to remove Saddam Hussein from power, rather than to establish a stable and self-sufficient government.\n\nA more considered approach might have yielded better results. A more nuanced understanding of the local dynamics and a clear plan for our objectives could have led to a more effective and sustainable resolution. In my opinion, the war in Iraq was a product of a knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy.\n\nLooking back, I believe that our involvement in Iraq has been a costly and misguided endeavor. We should have taken a more measured approach, prioritizing diplomacy and international cooperation over military intervention. In the end, I think our continued presence in the region is not a solution, but rather a cause of further instability."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church faces a challenge in adapting to the changing values of society. The institution has been experiencing a decline in its following, and I believe this can be attributed to its strict stance on several issues. The Church's views on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control are perceived as outdated by many, leading to a disconnect between the Church and its members.\n\nThe Church's traditional views may seem inflexible, causing some individuals to question their loyalty to the institution. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable being part of a community where these practices are discouraged. Similarly, the exclusion of women from the priesthood and the prohibition on priests getting married can create a sense of isolation and disconnect.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Church's stance on these issues has been a longstanding one. However, the question remains whether a more inclusive approach would help the Church regain its footing. The presence of married priests or female priests, for instance, might not have altered the outcome in recent controversies. Nevertheless, it is an idea worth exploring.\n\nThe notion that priests are devoted to their faith and, in effect, married to God, raises questions about the feasibility of priests having a family life. Most people in the working world balance their professional commitments with personal relationships and family obligations. It seems reasonable to assume that priests could do the same, especially given their role in the community.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church must consider the need for greater flexibility and accommodation in its views and practices. By doing so, it may be able to reconnect with its members and restore its relevance in a rapidly changing world.",
            "My perspective on the matter is that I do not object to same-sex marriage. In fact, I believe individuals are born with their sexual orientation, and it is not a conscious decision they make. As such, I think it is unfair to hold them accountable for their orientation. It is illogical to assert that a man and a woman can marry, yet deny the same right to two individuals of the same sex.\n\nUpon further consideration, it becomes apparent that sexual orientation is not a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it is not something they can change at will. For instance, just as some individuals are born with a certain eye color or hair color, others are born with a same-sex orientation. It would be unfair to penalize them for this natural aspect of their identity.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not interfere with matters of personal identity. Marriage is a deeply personal issue, and the government should not dictate who can and cannot get married based on arbitrary criteria. It is not a matter of moral or national security, but rather a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nFurthermore, the government lacks the right to intervene in people's lives and dictate their relationships. Same-sex couples should not be punished or stigmatized for being who they are. Their sexual orientation is a natural aspect of their identity, and they should be free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe the federal government should be involved in matters of same-sex marriage. This is a personal issue that should be left to the individuals involved, and the government should respect their choices and identities.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of significant importance, warranting a reevaluation of our societal stance on the issue. There are numerous reasons why gay marriage should be recognized as a fundamental right, and it's essential to address the misconceptions surrounding this topic.\n\nOne common argument against gay marriage is that it threatens the traditional family structure. However, this viewpoint neglects the complexity of modern relationships and the diverse ways in which people form families. Homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are united by a deep emotional bond and a commitment to one another. The idea that their relationships are inherently inferior is a flawed assumption that has been disproven by scientific studies.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples experience the same levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples. They face similar challenges and share similar strengths, such as the ability to form strong emotional connections and maintain a sense of trust and commitment. These findings underscore the notion that love knows no boundaries, and that the institution of marriage should be available to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nAnother misconception surrounding gay marriage is the idea that it's somehow incompatible with religious values. However, this notion is based on a narrow and outdated understanding of morality. In a pluralistic society, it's essential to recognize that individuals have diverse beliefs and values. The government should not impose a particular set of moral standards on its citizens, but rather respect the autonomy of each individual to make their own choices.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is a threat to traditional family values is also misplaced. The notion that children raised by gay parents are somehow disadvantaged or at risk is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents experience the same level of well-being and happiness as children raised by opposite-sex parents. The key factor in a child's development is not the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather the quality of care and support they receive.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of gay marriage is not just a matter of personal preference or cultural norms, but a fundamental human right. The ability to form a lifelong commitment with the person you love is a basic aspect of human dignity, and it's the government's responsibility to ensure that all individuals have access to this right.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the \"under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights the tension between religious values and secular governance. It's hypocritical for the government to impose a particular set of moral standards on its citizens while simultaneously separating church and state. The government should focus on creating a just and inclusive society, rather than catering to the interests of a particular religious group.\n\nFinally, it's essential to acknowledge that the stigma surrounding gay people is often rooted in misinformation and prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that being gay is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. Rather, research suggests that sexual orientation is a natural aspect of human diversity, and that individuals should be respected and accepted for who they are.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is a matter of human rights, equality, and dignity. It's time for our society to recognize the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. By doing so, we can create a more just and inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity to form meaningful relationships and live with dignity.",
            "I have had the opportunity to work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, where I gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding certain substances. One particular point that struck me is that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily determine its potential benefits. While I agree that making it widely available to the public may not be ideal, I do believe that it has medicinal value that should not be overlooked.\n\nIn fact, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in pharmacies for their therapeutic benefits, despite being classified as restricted. The fact that these substances are subject to strict regulations and monitoring highlights the importance of finding a balance between accessibility and responsible use.\n\nSome may argue that marijuana and alcohol have different risks associated with abuse, but it's essential to recognize that both substances can be misused. A more nuanced approach would be to consider gradual, phased implementation of its legalization, rather than an abrupt change. This would allow for a shift in societal perception and a more informed understanding of its potential benefits.\n\nThe negative stigma surrounding marijuana is largely a result of its illicit status, which has led to a distorted public image. However, by acknowledging its relatively low risk compared to more hazardous substances like heroin and cocaine, we can begin to reevaluate its potential uses and benefits. By removing the stigma and promoting a more balanced understanding, individuals may be more likely to use it responsibly, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "In recent years, I've observed a noticeable shift in the way my church has adapted to the 21st century. Gone are the days of strict, traditional practices. The church has made a concerted effort to become more inclusive and welcoming to its members. I've noticed that the atmosphere has become more casual, especially during the weekends. The church now offers a \"teen mass\" that caters to the needs of younger attendees, condensing the service to a more manageable thirty-minute duration. This change has contributed to a more relaxed atmosphere, where people feel comfortable dressing in casual attire, even on Sundays.\n\nAs a result, I've seen a significant change in the way people dress for mass. Gone are the days of formal attire; now, jeans and khakis are common sights, even at morning masses. While some may view this as a negative trend, I believe it's a positive step towards creating a more approachable and inviting environment.\n\nRegarding the controversy surrounding the Catholic Church and pedophilia, I believe that the issue is more complex than simply allowing female priests or married priests. While some may argue that these changes could have prevented these instances, I'm not convinced. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or profession. There are married individuals who have committed these heinous crimes, and it's not as if their marital status would have prevented their actions.\n\nIn fact, if someone is predisposed to pedophilia, it's unlikely that allowing them to marry or become a priest would have altered their behavior. Pedophilia is often linked to genetic factors, and it's unlikely that a person's environment or profession can change their fundamental nature. While it's possible that a person may try to suppress their desires, it's unlikely that they would be able to completely eliminate them.\n\nIn cases where the church may have been aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different story altogether. However, I'm not convinced that these actions were either intentional or widespread. If anything, I believe that the church's efforts to address these issues and create a more welcoming environment are steps in the right direction.\n\nIn conclusion, I have few thoughts on the matter, but I do believe that the church's efforts to adapt to the 21st century are a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming community. However, I also believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or profession.",
            "While initially willing to accept the premise, I began to develop reservations about the invasion of Iraq following the 9/11 attacks. I believe the Bush administration's decision to invade was, in part, a pretext, and that pretexts often led to the war. The administration's early claims linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, as well as assertions about Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction, have since been proven false. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me and sparked my concern about the Iraq war.\n\nThe Bush administration's tendency to deceive the public has been particularly striking. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, has since acknowledged that he had doubts about the validity of the information at the time. Such actions, in my opinion, constitute a grave abuse of power and a gross disregard for the principles of governance. This disregard for the truth and the constitution has been a persistent concern since 9/11, and I believe the administration's intentions were to pursue a war agenda from the outset.\n\nFurthermore, I have come across information suggesting that the younger Bush administration had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, likely fueled by his father's administration's previous dealings. The administration's aim to expand the country's energy supply, as well as the underhanded manner in which they pursued this goal, has left me with a lasting sense of unease.\n\nWhile I believe the war has gone on for too long, I am also aware that a hasty withdrawal could lead to further instability and bloodshed in the short term. The proposed solution of a coalition of neighboring nations, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, presents its own set of challenges, particularly with regards to Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government. The recent news reports indicate that the Parliament has struggled to function, and the influence of radical groups, such as Mugtada al-Sadr's party, continues to hinder the country's progress.\n\nThe complexity of the situation in Iraq is undeniable, and I struggle to articulate a clear solution that would address the underlying issues without causing further harm. However, I am willing to engage in a nuanced discussion about the challenges facing Iraq and the international community.",
            "As I reflect on the War in Iraq, I find myself struggling to articulate a clear stance. At its core, the conflict seems to have devolved into a complex web of motivations and expectations. Initially, I thought it was a clear-cut issue of retaliation against the country that had perpetrated the 9/11 attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has led me to question the legitimacy of our involvement.\n\nIt's clear that our presence in Iraq is driven in part by a desire to establish a democratic government, which I believe is a noble goal. However, I'm not convinced that this is a feasible or sustainable outcome, given the cultural and historical context of the region. Moreover, the human cost of the war is undeniable – families are torn apart, and innocent civilians are caught in the crossfire.\n\nWhen considering the long-term implications of our actions, I worry that our attempts to impose our values on Iraq may only serve to exacerbate the situation. The presence of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda, fueled by a deep-seated hatred of the United States, is a stark reminder that our actions can have unintended consequences.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the war in Iraq has become a protracted and multifaceted issue, with no easy solution in sight. The decision to continue or withdraw our troops is a difficult one, and I'm not convinced that there is a clear right or wrong answer. While I empathize with the families of those serving in Iraq, I also recognize the need to consider the broader implications of our actions.\n\nIn the end, I think it's essential to approach this issue with nuance and a willingness to listen to diverse perspectives. By doing so, we may be able to find a path forward that balances our interests with the needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people.",
            "The notion that a state or government should dictate what is considered lawful is a topic of significant debate. From my perspective, it seems counterintuitive to override the inherent separation of church and state as established by the constitution. This fundamental principle allows for the coexistence of diverse faiths, thereby promoting a culture of religious tolerance in the United States.\n\nA proposed amendment, aimed at restricting certain religious practices, would undermine the very fabric of this separation. Such an amendment would be at odds with the constitution's original intent and would likely serve as a unique example of government overreach, rather than a necessary regulation. It is essential to recognize that the constitution was designed to safeguard individual freedoms, not restrict them.\n\nThe reality is that various faiths have differing views on this matter. Catholics and Christians, for instance, often hold distinct stances on the issue. While some areas, such as Boston, may exhibit divergent views, this does not justify government intervention. In fact, it is the churches, not the government, that should be allowed to make decisions regarding their own practices.\n\nThe concept of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy. Any attempt to alter this fundamental aspect of the constitution would be misguided. Furthermore, I believe that such an amendment would be a rare instance of restriction imposed upon the people, rather than a check on government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal conviction, rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the nation. This perceived bias towards a specific faith over others is concerning, as it undermines the principles of equality and religious freedom that our country was founded upon.\n\nI fail to see how an amendment banning certain practices would positively impact the economy or society as a whole. In fact, it could potentially have a negative effect on the social fabric of our nation. On the other hand, allowing churches to maintain their autonomy in this matter might even have a positive impact on society.\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that the churches should be free to make their own decisions regarding their practices, without government interference. This approach would uphold the constitution's original intent and preserve the delicate balance between church and state.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of Government Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and it is essential to examine the motivations and consequences of this decision. Upon reflection, I firmly believe that the government was not entirely transparent with the American people regarding the reasons for the invasion. The supposed link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's emotional response to justify a preemptive strike.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I find it particularly troubling that the US government chose to engage in a preemptive strike. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking, with both conflicts characterized by a prolonged and costly occupation. The US government should have learned from past mistakes and acknowledged the complexity of nation-building.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and the attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq were admirable goals, but the execution was woefully inadequate. The US government underestimated the difficulty of filling the power vacuum and the chaos that would ensue. The consequences of this miscalculation have been devastating, with thousands of American lives lost and a prolonged occupation that has yet to yield a stable government.\n\nA critical examination of the war's justification reveals a far more nuanced reality. The Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were baseless, and the true motivations behind the invasion seem to have been driven by a desire to secure Iraq's oil resources. The US government's handling of the crisis has been marred by a lack of transparency and a failure to consider alternative solutions.\n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and protracted conflict, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to grapple with the consequences of its actions, it is essential to reevaluate its foreign policy and consider the long-term implications of military intervention. Ultimately, the Iraq War serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unbridled military power and the importance of careful planning and consideration in foreign policy decision-making.\n\nIn retrospect, I believe that the US government's decision to invade Iraq was a grave mistake, driven by a flawed understanding of the complexities of nation-building and a failure to consider the long-term consequences of its actions. As the world continues to navigate the aftermath of this conflict, it is essential to learn from the past and strive for a more nuanced and informed approach to international relations.",
            "I'd like to express my unwavering support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. This stance has been a constant in my perspective, rooted in the understanding that a person's sexual orientation is largely influenced by biological factors rather than societal norms. The scientific community has increasingly acknowledged this distinction, highlighting the role of genetics in shaping our identities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices about their relationships, unencumbered by external restrictions. It's essential to recognize that the institution of marriage is a personal matter, not a subject for the government to dictate. The separation of personal lives from public policy is a fundamental principle that I strongly advocate for.\n\nIn my community, I have witnessed firsthand the love and commitment of same-sex couples who are denied the right to formalize their relationships. These individuals, just like any others, contribute to society in meaningful ways, sharing the joys and responsibilities of family life. The notion that they should be treated as second-class citizens is not only unjust but also hurtful.\n\nThe recent attempts to define marriage according to narrow, personal agendas are misguided and demonstrate a lack of respect for the complexities of human relationships. Research has shed light on the biological underpinnings of sexual orientation, challenging simplistic explanations that attribute it to environmental factors.\n\nThe disparity in public perception is striking: while individuals can easily enter into a private marriage in many parts of the country, same-sex couples face widespread scrutiny and judgment. I believe that marriage should be a private, personal choice, free from the influence of politics and public opinion. It's time for us to recognize the inherent value of love and commitment, regardless of its expression.\n\nI am confident that, with a more nuanced understanding of human nature and a commitment to equality, we can work towards a future where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.",
            "When something gets posted online, it becomes part of the public domain, accessible to everyone. As a resident advisor, I've encountered instances where online content has had serious consequences. For example, posting about violent or sensitive topics can spark concern among students, staff, and other stakeholders. In such cases, it's crucial for the administration to take swift action, as they cannot ignore potential threats to campus safety.\n\nThe issue of online privacy is also a concern. While social media platforms offer users a degree of control over their content, it's essential to remember that once something is online, it's no longer private. If you're hesitant to share certain information, it's best not to share it at all. Unfortunately, even well-intentioned posts can be misinterpreted, especially when taken out of context.\n\nIn our school's experience, a situation arose where a student's online comments were misinterpreted as a credible threat. The situation was eventually resolved, but it highlighted the importance of being mindful of online behavior. While school officials should not overstep their bounds by monitoring students' private online activities, they do have a responsibility to act when concerns are brought to their attention.\n\nIt's also worth noting that attempting to maintain a separate online presence, such as creating a fake social media account to interact with students, can be seen as a breach of trust. As a resident advisor, I prefer to maintain professional boundaries and avoid unnecessary involvement in students' personal lives. By doing so, I can focus on providing support and guidance without compromising my role or their autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, online content can have far-reaching consequences, and it's essential to be cautious when sharing information online. While social media can be a valuable tool for communication and self-expression, it's crucial to remember that once something is posted, it's no longer private.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its initial objectives. Although the intention to promote democracy in a country lacking a fair political system was a commendable goal, it appears that this objective has become distorted over time. I believe that the primary motivation behind the war was to rectify the undemocratic situation in Iraq, but subsequent events have led me to suspect that personal vendettas, such as those between the Bush administration and Saddam Hussein, may have played a significant role in the decision-making process.\n\nIn my opinion, the core objective of establishing democracy in Iraq was achieved within the initial stages of the conflict. The fact that the war has dragged on for over a year and a half, with no clear end in sight, has led me to believe that our motivations have become increasingly unclear. It seems that the war has become an end in itself, rather than a means to an end.\n\nIf our original goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I would have supported the war as a just cause. However, I fear that our objectives have been muddled and that we are now fighting for reasons that are no longer relevant. The war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, with a desire to avoid a decisive outcome rather than to achieve a tangible goal.\n\nThe financial burden of the war has been substantial, with billions of dollars being spent on a conflict that is no longer serving its original purpose. I believe that these resources could be better allocated towards addressing pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. It is disheartening to see funds being diverted towards a war that has lost its justification, when there are so many pressing needs within our own country.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the war has outlived its purpose and that it is time for it to come to a close. The Iraqi government will eventually need to take responsibility for its own affairs, and it is our duty to prioritize our own domestic concerns, rather than perpetuating a conflict that is no longer serving the greater good.",
            "The question at hand revolves around the delicate balance between online safety and individual freedom. When personal information is shared on social media platforms such as Myspace, one must consider the fact that it is inherently accessible to a wide audience. In the case of Myspace, for instance, users require a friend request to view another user's profile, which implies a tacit consent on the part of the owner to share their information with that individual. Consequently, it is essential to acknowledge that any information posted online may be viewed by numerous people.\n\nIt is intriguing to ponder the potential implications of this dynamic. On one hand, it is possible for users to identify potential threats or warning signs by monitoring social media activity. However, this raises concerns about surveillance and the feasibility of monitoring an individual's online presence without infringing upon their right to privacy. \n\nConsidering the constraints of a school environment, it is not practicable for one person to scrutinize the online profiles of every student. Nevertheless, it is a complex issue, as it may be perceived as discriminatory to selectively monitor certain individuals. \n\nAs a user of social media platforms like Facebook, I am acutely aware of the risks associated with sharing personal information. I have taken measures to limit the visibility of my profile, but I also recognize the importance of maintaining a presence on these platforms for social purposes. \n\nAnother perspective on this issue comes from the story of a man who demonstrated the ease with which he could gather personal information and subsequently manipulate an individual. This instance highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing online and the potential consequences of online interactions. \n\nIn a similar vein, I have encountered situations where acquaintances from classes have initiated online conversations with me despite not knowing my real name. While this can be unsettling, it also underscores the interconnectedness of online relationships and the ease with which people can obtain information about others.\n\nLastly, I recall a discussion about a high school that banned students from using Myspace, which sparked some concern regarding the school's authority over students' online activities. While I am unsure about the specifics of the situation, it raises questions about the boundaries of school administrators' power to dictate students' online behavior.",
            "The Iraq War stands as a prime example of a conflict that has garnered significant international criticism. While acknowledging the complexities surrounding the decision to invade Iraq, it is undeniable that a substantial portion of the global population holds a negative view of the war. A multitude of polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and across the globe indicate that approximately 75-80% of the population believes the war was a misstep. Furthermore, a significant percentage of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, with many advocating for a withdrawal within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been marked by a series of challenges, both prior to and following the invasion. The cultural divide between the United States and the Middle East has been a significant obstacle in the pursuit of establishing a harmonious and stable democracy in the region. The idea that Western ideals can be imposed on a society with a profoundly distinct culture and history has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile acknowledging the flaws of Saddam Hussein's regime, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of invading a country, particularly one that has become a quagmire. The decision to intervene in Iraq was met with widespread criticism, and the administration's justification for prolonging the occupation has not yet been convincing.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a feasible option, but the underlying question remains: what is the justification for staying in Iraq beyond a certain point? It is essential to consider the opinions of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for a U.S. withdrawal. In fact, a substantial percentage of Iraqis believe that the U.S. should leave immediately. This raises the question: should we not respect the will of the people we are purportedly attempting to help?\n\nIf we were to respect their opinion, it would alleviate the burden of responsibility in the event of a catastrophe. By acknowledging the Iraqi people's desire for U.S. departure, we could potentially rebrand our involvement as a benevolent and proactive measure, rather than a protracted and contentious occupation.\n\nUltimately, the Middle East remains a complex and challenging region, and the U.S. role in Iraq has been marked by controversy. While we may not be able to repair the damage done, we can at least strive to exit the situation with a sense of integrity and a recognition of the cultural and historical nuances that have shaped the conflict.",
            "The issue of gender discrimination still persists in the United States, albeit in subtle forms. While it affects both genders, its manifestations vary depending on the specific field of work and societal context. Historically, women have faced significant barriers to achieving equality, particularly in the corporate world, where the \"glass ceiling\" has prevented many from ascending to senior positions. This is due in part to the deeply ingrained notion that women are not typically suited for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women; men also face gender-based biases, albeit in different areas. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often encounter skepticism and even ridicule from society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This societal expectation can be alienating and make their choices seem invalid, even if they're driven by a desire to be actively involved in their children's lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are often stereotyped and judged based on their style and interests. Those who don't conform to traditional notions of masculinity may be viewed with suspicion or dismissed as not being \"true\" fashion enthusiasts. This narrow-mindedness can be frustrating for men who are passionate about fashion and have a deep understanding of the industry.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote a more nuanced understanding of gender roles and expectations. Rather than forcing change, we should focus on highlighting the strengths and qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped or marginalized. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive environment that values diversity and allows people to pursue their passions without fear of judgment.\n\nWhile progress has been made, it's essential to acknowledge that change takes time. The pace of progress may be slow, but it's crucial to continue working towards a more equitable society. By celebrating the achievements of individuals who challenge traditional norms and stereotypes, we can create a more accepting and inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that socioeconomic factors, such as education and geographic background, can also contribute to gender-based biases. For example, someone from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those who are more educated and from urban areas. This highlights the need for a more holistic approach to addressing gender discrimination, one that takes into account the complex interplay of factors that influence our perceptions and biases.\n\nUltimately, promoting awareness and understanding is crucial to creating a more inclusive and equitable society. By recognizing the complexities of gender-based biases and working together to challenge them, we can create a brighter future for everyone.",
            "From what I understand, the decriminalization of marijuana has essentially downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to receiving a traffic ticket. This means that instead of facing arrest and a lengthy court process, individuals can simply be cited and released. While this may eliminate some of the more severe consequences associated with a drug charge, such as the impact on future job prospects, it does not necessarily alleviate these concerns entirely.\n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the costs associated with arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals accused of marijuana possession are substantial and can be better spent on other community programs. For instance, in cities that are financially strained, the savings from decriminalization could be redirected towards education, social services, and other essential programs.\n\nDenver, a city known for its generally more progressive attitude, is a notable example of a place where decriminalization has likely freed up valuable resources for the community. By doing so, the city can invest in initiatives that benefit residents, such as food programs for the homeless and social services for the elderly.\n\nWhile some may argue that unchecked marijuana use could lead to social and public health issues, such as increased instances of driving under the influence, it is essential to consider the unique characteristics of individual users and their ability to exercise moderation. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol can have detrimental effects on individuals, but their impacts can vary greatly depending on the person. As with any substance, it is crucial to recognize that people respond differently, and some may be more prone to problematic behavior than others.\n\nBy acknowledging these complexities and nuances, we can have a more informed discussion about the role of marijuana in our society and the most effective ways to regulate its use.",
            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its long-standing customs and practices serve as a foundation for unity and continuity. However, this emphasis on tradition can sometimes hinder the Church's ability to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nI've observed that many Catholics believe it's essential to attend church services regularly, and the Church can be quite rigid in its expectations. At times, this results in a perceived disconnect between the Church's doctrine and its actions. For instance, the Church's stance on doctrine can be quite strict, leading to the exclusion of individuals who don't conform to its teachings or belong to other faiths.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' interfaith marriage. My father was an Episcopalian, and my mother was a Catholic. Due to my father's religion, they were unable to get married in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's teachings on acceptance and its practices.\n\nThe concept of loving others is a fundamental aspect of Catholicism, yet the Church's actions often seem to contradict this principle. The disconnect between doctrine and practice can be attributed to the Church's slow pace of reform. Despite its outdated practices, the Church continues to uphold them, which can be seen as hypocritical.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being married, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that allowing priests to marry would alleviate the risk of pedophilic behavior, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Those who engage in such behavior often do so for reasons unrelated to their marital status. In my opinion, the root of the problem lies elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, the decision to allow priests to marry should be based on a thorough examination of its potential consequences, rather than relying on assumptions about its impact on pedophilic behavior. It's essential to consider the complexities of the issue and the potential outcomes before making a decision.",
            "In this complex issue, I've yet to form a definitive stance on the interplay between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. While it's challenging to navigate this topic without unintentionally offending individuals, I firmly believe that the current debate surrounding marriage is among the most contentious issues we face today. \n\nOne of the primary difficulties in defining marriage lies in its delicate balance between governmental involvement and personal faith. For instance, civil unions, which are essentially partnerships between two consenting adults, often lack the tax benefits and government recognition that marriage provides. If we consider marriage as a sacred institution, as many people do, it raises questions about the role of the government in recognizing these partnerships. \n\nFrom my perspective, I think the most practical approach would be to view marriage as a civil union, devoid of the government's need to scrutinize the specifics of the union. After all, the fundamental aspect of marriage is the union of two individuals in a committed relationship. \n\nRegarding the matter of gay marriage, I believe that two consenting adults in a civil union should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as any other couple, regardless of their sexual orientation. If the majority of states can come to a logical consensus on this issue, it would be prudent to push for federal legislation that supports this cause.\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree with the notion of amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage. The constitution should not be modified lightly, and this issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic measure. In my opinion, it is not substantial enough to justify altering the fundamental document of our nation.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that the constitution should be amended to ban gay marriage. It is a matter that should be addressed through legislative channels, rather than a constitutional amendment.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household presented a complex perspective on the topic of homosexuality. As I have developed relationships with gay friends, my views have evolved to acknowledge the issue's nuance. While I may not fully endorse the lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be a matter of personal choice rather than a national debate.\n\nIn a country with diverse states, each with its own government and citizenry, it's logical that policy decisions should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government. This approach allows for a more tailored approach to accommodate regional values and preferences.\n\nSome argue that states with democratic governments will naturally be more open to recognizing gay marriage, while those with more conservative leanings may not. However, I believe individuals who choose to reside in a state with a particular stance on the issue should respect the local decision. Rather than attempting to impose a uniform policy nationwide, it's essential to grant states the autonomy to shape their own laws.\n\nThe federal government should not dictate the personal choices and values of individual states. By leaving this decision to the states, we can ensure that each region can address the issue in a way that aligns with the needs and values of its citizens.\n\nWhile some may argue that a uniform national policy would promote unity, I believe that this approach would also infringe upon the rights of states to self-govern. Ultimately, the decision on gay marriage should rest with the people who will be directly affected by it – the residents of each state. The federal government's role is to ensure that states have the freedom to make their own choices, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nIn the case of the current ban on gay marriage, I disagree with the notion that the president should have the authority to dictate a national policy. The decision should be left to the states, as they will be the ones to navigate the complexities of implementing and enforcing the policy. Furthermore, the ban is set to expire in the near future, and any future president could simply reverse it, rendering the issue subject to ongoing debate.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing each region to address the issue in a way that reflects its unique values and needs. By granting states the autonomy to make their own decisions, we can promote a more inclusive and responsive approach to this complex issue.",
            "When considering the debate over school officials' rights to monitor students' online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the public nature of social media platforms like Myspace. If a student posts content online, they should be aware that it can be accessed by anyone, including school administrators. This is particularly relevant in the context of preventing harm, such as school shootings.\n\nWhile it may be perceived as an invasion of privacy for officials to monitor students' online activity, the primary concern is the safety and well-being of students. If officials are able to identify potential issues or risks by monitoring online activity, they have a responsibility to take action to ensure a safe environment.\n\nIn fact, many schools have protocols in place to address potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency response procedures. These measures are designed to protect students and staff in the event of an emergency. By monitoring online activity, officials can identify potential issues before they escalate and take proactive steps to prevent harm.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a long-lasting impact, and online content can be easily accessible even after it's been deleted. This can lead to unintended consequences, making it essential for students to be mindful of their online presence.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure learning environment. While this may involve some measures that could be seen as invasive, the end result is a safer school community.\n\nIn a similar vein, when students are aware that their online activity is being monitored, they may be more cautious about what they post and share online. This can lead to a more responsible and respectful online culture, which is beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nBy weighing the potential benefits of monitoring online activity against the concerns about privacy, it's clear that officials have a legitimate reason to take a closer look at student online behavior. This can help prevent harm and create a safer school environment, making it a worthwhile investment of their time and resources.",
            "My thoughts on the war in the Middle East have undergone a significant shift since the events of September 11. Initially, I was deeply affected by the tragedy and supported the idea of taking decisive action against those responsible. However, as time passed, I began to question the preparation and motivations behind our involvement. It became clear that a more measured and thoughtful approach was necessary, rather than an impulsive reaction fueled by emotions.\n\nUpon reflection, it appears that we underestimated the complexities of the situation and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. Without a clear plan or sufficient understanding of the local dynamics, we entered the conflict unprepared, which ultimately led to a series of challenges and setbacks. In hindsight, it's clear that the war did not achieve its intended goals and, in fact, may have exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East is characterized by deep-seated sectarian divisions, and our involvement has not been able to bridge these gaps. Instead, it seems that our presence has become a source of further instability, allowing local factions to focus on their internal struggles rather than uniting against a common enemy. Considering this, I believe that our continued involvement is not only ineffective but also counterproductive.\n\nA key factor in the failure of our efforts is the vastly different understanding of war and its purposes held by various parties involved. For us, war is a means to an end, a way to achieve a specific goal or resolve a conflict. In contrast, for some of the local actors, war is a way of life, often driven by tribal or sectarian allegiances rather than a desire for nation-building or peace. This fundamental difference in perspective has made it challenging for us to find common ground and achieve a lasting resolution.\n\nIn retrospect, it's clear that our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a desire to respond to the trauma of 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy. While I can understand the emotional response, I believe that a more thoughtful and nuanced approach would have yielded better results. Our leaders, including President Bush, were under pressure from public opinion and the desire for swift action, which led to a rushed and poorly planned intervention.\n\nIn the end, I think it's essential to acknowledge that we cannot impose our values or systems of governance on other countries. Each nation has its unique history, culture, and path to self-determination. Our role should be to support and assist, rather than dictate, the course of events. Our continued presence in the Middle East is not only unsustainable but also counterproductive, as it perpetuates the cycle of violence and division.\n\nIn conclusion, my views on the war in the Middle East have evolved significantly over time. While I initially supported the idea of taking action, I now believe that our involvement has been misguided and that it's time for us to reassess our role in the region. By acknowledging our limitations and the complexities of the situation, we can take a more constructive approach to promoting peace and stability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church faces a challenge in adapting to the changing values of society. The institution has been experiencing a decline in its following, and I believe this can be attributed to its strict stance on several issues. The Church's views on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control are perceived as outdated by many, leading to a disconnect between the Church and its members.\n\nThe Church's traditional views may seem inflexible, causing some individuals to question their loyalty to the institution. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable being part of a community where these practices are discouraged. Similarly, the exclusion of women from the priesthood and the prohibition on priests getting married can create a sense of isolation and disconnect.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Church's stance on these issues has been a longstanding one. However, the question remains whether a more inclusive approach would help the Church regain its footing. The presence of married priests or female priests, for instance, might not have altered the outcome in recent controversies. Nevertheless, it is an idea worth exploring.\n\nThe notion that priests are devoted to their faith and, in effect, married to God, raises questions about the feasibility of priests having a family life. Most people in the working world balance their professional commitments with personal relationships and family obligations. It seems reasonable to assume that priests could do the same, especially given their role in the community.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church must consider the need for greater flexibility and accommodation in its views and practices. By doing so, it may be able to reconnect with its members and restore its relevance in a rapidly changing world.",
            "My perspective on the matter is that I do not object to same-sex marriage. In fact, I believe individuals are born with their sexual orientation, and it is not a conscious decision they make. As such, I think it is unfair to hold them accountable for their orientation. It is illogical to assert that a man and a woman can marry, yet deny the same right to two individuals of the same sex.\n\nUpon further consideration, it becomes apparent that sexual orientation is not a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it is not something they can change at will. For instance, just as some individuals are born with a certain eye color or hair color, others are born with a same-sex orientation. It would be unfair to penalize them for this natural aspect of their identity.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not interfere with matters of personal identity. Marriage is a deeply personal issue, and the government should not dictate who can and cannot get married based on arbitrary criteria. It is not a matter of moral or national security, but rather a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nFurthermore, the government lacks the right to intervene in people's lives and dictate their relationships. Same-sex couples should not be punished or stigmatized for being who they are. Their sexual orientation is a natural aspect of their identity, and they should be free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe the federal government should be involved in matters of same-sex marriage. This is a personal issue that should be left to the individuals involved, and the government should respect their choices and identities.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of significant importance, warranting a reevaluation of our societal stance on the issue. There are numerous reasons why gay marriage should be recognized as a fundamental right, and it's essential to address the misconceptions surrounding this topic.\n\nOne common argument against gay marriage is that it threatens the traditional family structure. However, this viewpoint neglects the complexity of modern relationships and the diverse ways in which people form families. Homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are united by a deep emotional bond and a commitment to one another. The idea that their relationships are inherently inferior is a flawed assumption that has been disproven by scientific studies.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples experience the same levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples. They face similar challenges and share similar strengths, such as the ability to form strong emotional connections and maintain a sense of trust and commitment. These findings underscore the notion that love knows no boundaries, and that the institution of marriage should be available to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nAnother misconception surrounding gay marriage is the idea that it's somehow incompatible with religious values. However, this notion is based on a narrow and outdated understanding of morality. In a pluralistic society, it's essential to recognize that individuals have diverse beliefs and values. The government should not impose a particular set of moral standards on its citizens, but rather respect the autonomy of each individual to make their own choices.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is a threat to traditional family values is also misplaced. The notion that children raised by gay parents are somehow disadvantaged or at risk is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents experience the same level of well-being and happiness as children raised by opposite-sex parents. The key factor in a child's development is not the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather the quality of care and support they receive.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of gay marriage is not just a matter of personal preference or cultural norms, but a fundamental human right. The ability to form a lifelong commitment with the person you love is a basic aspect of human dignity, and it's the government's responsibility to ensure that all individuals have access to this right.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the \"under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights the tension between religious values and secular governance. It's hypocritical for the government to impose a particular set of moral standards on its citizens while simultaneously separating church and state. The government should focus on creating a just and inclusive society, rather than catering to the interests of a particular religious group.\n\nFinally, it's essential to acknowledge that the stigma surrounding gay people is often rooted in misinformation and prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that being gay is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. Rather, research suggests that sexual orientation is a natural aspect of human diversity, and that individuals should be respected and accepted for who they are.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is a matter of human rights, equality, and dignity. It's time for our society to recognize the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. By doing so, we can create a more just and inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity to form meaningful relationships and live with dignity.",
            "I have had the opportunity to work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, where I gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding certain substances. One particular point that struck me is that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily determine its potential benefits. While I agree that making it widely available to the public may not be ideal, I do believe that it has medicinal value that should not be overlooked.\n\nIn fact, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in pharmacies for their therapeutic benefits, despite being classified as restricted. The fact that these substances are subject to strict regulations and monitoring highlights the importance of finding a balance between accessibility and responsible use.\n\nSome may argue that marijuana and alcohol have different risks associated with abuse, but it's essential to recognize that both substances can be misused. A more nuanced approach would be to consider gradual, phased implementation of its legalization, rather than an abrupt change. This would allow for a shift in societal perception and a more informed understanding of its potential benefits.\n\nThe negative stigma surrounding marijuana is largely a result of its illicit status, which has led to a distorted public image. However, by acknowledging its relatively low risk compared to more hazardous substances like heroin and cocaine, we can begin to reevaluate its potential uses and benefits. By removing the stigma and promoting a more balanced understanding, individuals may be more likely to use it responsibly, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "In recent years, I've observed a noticeable shift in the way my church has adapted to the 21st century. Gone are the days of strict, traditional practices. The church has made a concerted effort to become more inclusive and welcoming to its members. I've noticed that the atmosphere has become more casual, especially during the weekends. The church now offers a \"teen mass\" that caters to the needs of younger attendees, condensing the service to a more manageable thirty-minute duration. This change has contributed to a more relaxed atmosphere, where people feel comfortable dressing in casual attire, even on Sundays.\n\nAs a result, I've seen a significant change in the way people dress for mass. Gone are the days of formal attire; now, jeans and khakis are common sights, even at morning masses. While some may view this as a negative trend, I believe it's a positive step towards creating a more approachable and inviting environment.\n\nRegarding the controversy surrounding the Catholic Church and pedophilia, I believe that the issue is more complex than simply allowing female priests or married priests. While some may argue that these changes could have prevented these instances, I'm not convinced. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or profession. There are married individuals who have committed these heinous crimes, and it's not as if their marital status would have prevented their actions.\n\nIn fact, if someone is predisposed to pedophilia, it's unlikely that allowing them to marry or become a priest would have altered their behavior. Pedophilia is often linked to genetic factors, and it's unlikely that a person's environment or profession can change their fundamental nature. While it's possible that a person may try to suppress their desires, it's unlikely that they would be able to completely eliminate them.\n\nIn cases where the church may have been aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different story altogether. However, I'm not convinced that these actions were either intentional or widespread. If anything, I believe that the church's efforts to address these issues and create a more welcoming environment are steps in the right direction.\n\nIn conclusion, I have few thoughts on the matter, but I do believe that the church's efforts to adapt to the 21st century are a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming community. However, I also believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or profession.",
            "While initially willing to accept the premise, I began to develop reservations about the invasion of Iraq following the 9/11 attacks. I believe the Bush administration's decision to invade was, in part, a pretext, and that pretexts often led to the war. The administration's early claims linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, as well as assertions about Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction, have since been proven false. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me and sparked my concern about the Iraq war.\n\nThe Bush administration's tendency to deceive the public has been particularly striking. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, has since acknowledged that he had doubts about the validity of the information at the time. Such actions, in my opinion, constitute a grave abuse of power and a gross disregard for the principles of governance. This disregard for the truth and the constitution has been a persistent concern since 9/11, and I believe the administration's intentions were to pursue a war agenda from the outset.\n\nFurthermore, I have come across information suggesting that the younger Bush administration had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, likely fueled by his father's administration's previous dealings. The administration's aim to expand the country's energy supply, as well as the underhanded manner in which they pursued this goal, has left me with a lasting sense of unease.\n\nWhile I believe the war has gone on for too long, I am also aware that a hasty withdrawal could lead to further instability and bloodshed in the short term. The proposed solution of a coalition of neighboring nations, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, presents its own set of challenges, particularly with regards to Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government. The recent news reports indicate that the Parliament has struggled to function, and the influence of radical groups, such as Mugtada al-Sadr's party, continues to hinder the country's progress.\n\nThe complexity of the situation in Iraq is undeniable, and I struggle to articulate a clear solution that would address the underlying issues without causing further harm. However, I am willing to engage in a nuanced discussion about the challenges facing Iraq and the international community.",
            "As I reflect on the War in Iraq, I find myself struggling to articulate a clear stance. At its core, the conflict seems to have devolved into a complex web of motivations and expectations. Initially, I thought it was a clear-cut issue of retaliation against the country that had perpetrated the 9/11 attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has led me to question the legitimacy of our involvement.\n\nIt's clear that our presence in Iraq is driven in part by a desire to establish a democratic government, which I believe is a noble goal. However, I'm not convinced that this is a feasible or sustainable outcome, given the cultural and historical context of the region. Moreover, the human cost of the war is undeniable – families are torn apart, and innocent civilians are caught in the crossfire.\n\nWhen considering the long-term implications of our actions, I worry that our attempts to impose our values on Iraq may only serve to exacerbate the situation. The presence of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda, fueled by a deep-seated hatred of the United States, is a stark reminder that our actions can have unintended consequences.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the war in Iraq has become a protracted and multifaceted issue, with no easy solution in sight. The decision to continue or withdraw our troops is a difficult one, and I'm not convinced that there is a clear right or wrong answer. While I empathize with the families of those serving in Iraq, I also recognize the need to consider the broader implications of our actions.\n\nIn the end, I think it's essential to approach this issue with nuance and a willingness to listen to diverse perspectives. By doing so, we may be able to find a path forward that balances our interests with the needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people.",
            "The notion that a state or government should dictate what is considered lawful is a topic of significant debate. From my perspective, it seems counterintuitive to override the inherent separation of church and state as established by the constitution. This fundamental principle allows for the coexistence of diverse faiths, thereby promoting a culture of religious tolerance in the United States.\n\nA proposed amendment, aimed at restricting certain religious practices, would undermine the very fabric of this separation. Such an amendment would be at odds with the constitution's original intent and would likely serve as a unique example of government overreach, rather than a necessary regulation. It is essential to recognize that the constitution was designed to safeguard individual freedoms, not restrict them.\n\nThe reality is that various faiths have differing views on this matter. Catholics and Christians, for instance, often hold distinct stances on the issue. While some areas, such as Boston, may exhibit divergent views, this does not justify government intervention. In fact, it is the churches, not the government, that should be allowed to make decisions regarding their own practices.\n\nThe concept of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy. Any attempt to alter this fundamental aspect of the constitution would be misguided. Furthermore, I believe that such an amendment would be a rare instance of restriction imposed upon the people, rather than a check on government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal conviction, rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the nation. This perceived bias towards a specific faith over others is concerning, as it undermines the principles of equality and religious freedom that our country was founded upon.\n\nI fail to see how an amendment banning certain practices would positively impact the economy or society as a whole. In fact, it could potentially have a negative effect on the social fabric of our nation. On the other hand, allowing churches to maintain their autonomy in this matter might even have a positive impact on society.\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that the churches should be free to make their own decisions regarding their practices, without government interference. This approach would uphold the constitution's original intent and preserve the delicate balance between church and state.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of Government Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and it is essential to examine the motivations and consequences of this decision. Upon reflection, I firmly believe that the government was not entirely transparent with the American people regarding the reasons for the invasion. The supposed link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's emotional response to justify a preemptive strike.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I find it particularly troubling that the US government chose to engage in a preemptive strike. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking, with both conflicts characterized by a prolonged and costly occupation. The US government should have learned from past mistakes and acknowledged the complexity of nation-building.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and the attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq were admirable goals, but the execution was woefully inadequate. The US government underestimated the difficulty of filling the power vacuum and the chaos that would ensue. The consequences of this miscalculation have been devastating, with thousands of American lives lost and a prolonged occupation that has yet to yield a stable government.\n\nA critical examination of the war's justification reveals a far more nuanced reality. The Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were baseless, and the true motivations behind the invasion seem to have been driven by a desire to secure Iraq's oil resources. The US government's handling of the crisis has been marred by a lack of transparency and a failure to consider alternative solutions.\n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and protracted conflict, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to grapple with the consequences of its actions, it is essential to reevaluate its foreign policy and consider the long-term implications of military intervention. Ultimately, the Iraq War serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unbridled military power and the importance of careful planning and consideration in foreign policy decision-making.\n\nIn retrospect, I believe that the US government's decision to invade Iraq was a grave mistake, driven by a flawed understanding of the complexities of nation-building and a failure to consider the long-term consequences of its actions. As the world continues to navigate the aftermath of this conflict, it is essential to learn from the past and strive for a more nuanced and informed approach to international relations.",
            "I'd like to express my unwavering support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. This stance has been a constant in my perspective, rooted in the understanding that a person's sexual orientation is largely influenced by biological factors rather than societal norms. The scientific community has increasingly acknowledged this distinction, highlighting the role of genetics in shaping our identities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices about their relationships, unencumbered by external restrictions. It's essential to recognize that the institution of marriage is a personal matter, not a subject for the government to dictate. The separation of personal lives from public policy is a fundamental principle that I strongly advocate for.\n\nIn my community, I have witnessed firsthand the love and commitment of same-sex couples who are denied the right to formalize their relationships. These individuals, just like any others, contribute to society in meaningful ways, sharing the joys and responsibilities of family life. The notion that they should be treated as second-class citizens is not only unjust but also hurtful.\n\nThe recent attempts to define marriage according to narrow, personal agendas are misguided and demonstrate a lack of respect for the complexities of human relationships. Research has shed light on the biological underpinnings of sexual orientation, challenging simplistic explanations that attribute it to environmental factors.\n\nThe disparity in public perception is striking: while individuals can easily enter into a private marriage in many parts of the country, same-sex couples face widespread scrutiny and judgment. I believe that marriage should be a private, personal choice, free from the influence of politics and public opinion. It's time for us to recognize the inherent value of love and commitment, regardless of its expression.\n\nI am confident that, with a more nuanced understanding of human nature and a commitment to equality, we can work towards a future where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.",
            "When something gets posted online, it becomes part of the public domain, accessible to everyone. As a resident advisor, I've encountered instances where online content has had serious consequences. For example, posting about violent or sensitive topics can spark concern among students, staff, and other stakeholders. In such cases, it's crucial for the administration to take swift action, as they cannot ignore potential threats to campus safety.\n\nThe issue of online privacy is also a concern. While social media platforms offer users a degree of control over their content, it's essential to remember that once something is online, it's no longer private. If you're hesitant to share certain information, it's best not to share it at all. Unfortunately, even well-intentioned posts can be misinterpreted, especially when taken out of context.\n\nIn our school's experience, a situation arose where a student's online comments were misinterpreted as a credible threat. The situation was eventually resolved, but it highlighted the importance of being mindful of online behavior. While school officials should not overstep their bounds by monitoring students' private online activities, they do have a responsibility to act when concerns are brought to their attention.\n\nIt's also worth noting that attempting to maintain a separate online presence, such as creating a fake social media account to interact with students, can be seen as a breach of trust. As a resident advisor, I prefer to maintain professional boundaries and avoid unnecessary involvement in students' personal lives. By doing so, I can focus on providing support and guidance without compromising my role or their autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, online content can have far-reaching consequences, and it's essential to be cautious when sharing information online. While social media can be a valuable tool for communication and self-expression, it's crucial to remember that once something is posted, it's no longer private.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its initial objectives. Although the intention to promote democracy in a country lacking a fair political system was a commendable goal, it appears that this objective has become distorted over time. I believe that the primary motivation behind the war was to rectify the undemocratic situation in Iraq, but subsequent events have led me to suspect that personal vendettas, such as those between the Bush administration and Saddam Hussein, may have played a significant role in the decision-making process.\n\nIn my opinion, the core objective of establishing democracy in Iraq was achieved within the initial stages of the conflict. The fact that the war has dragged on for over a year and a half, with no clear end in sight, has led me to believe that our motivations have become increasingly unclear. It seems that the war has become an end in itself, rather than a means to an end.\n\nIf our original goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I would have supported the war as a just cause. However, I fear that our objectives have been muddled and that we are now fighting for reasons that are no longer relevant. The war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, with a desire to avoid a decisive outcome rather than to achieve a tangible goal.\n\nThe financial burden of the war has been substantial, with billions of dollars being spent on a conflict that is no longer serving its original purpose. I believe that these resources could be better allocated towards addressing pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. It is disheartening to see funds being diverted towards a war that has lost its justification, when there are so many pressing needs within our own country.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the war has outlived its purpose and that it is time for it to come to a close. The Iraqi government will eventually need to take responsibility for its own affairs, and it is our duty to prioritize our own domestic concerns, rather than perpetuating a conflict that is no longer serving the greater good.",
            "The question at hand revolves around the delicate balance between online safety and individual freedom. When personal information is shared on social media platforms such as Myspace, one must consider the fact that it is inherently accessible to a wide audience. In the case of Myspace, for instance, users require a friend request to view another user's profile, which implies a tacit consent on the part of the owner to share their information with that individual. Consequently, it is essential to acknowledge that any information posted online may be viewed by numerous people.\n\nIt is intriguing to ponder the potential implications of this dynamic. On one hand, it is possible for users to identify potential threats or warning signs by monitoring social media activity. However, this raises concerns about surveillance and the feasibility of monitoring an individual's online presence without infringing upon their right to privacy. \n\nConsidering the constraints of a school environment, it is not practicable for one person to scrutinize the online profiles of every student. Nevertheless, it is a complex issue, as it may be perceived as discriminatory to selectively monitor certain individuals. \n\nAs a user of social media platforms like Facebook, I am acutely aware of the risks associated with sharing personal information. I have taken measures to limit the visibility of my profile, but I also recognize the importance of maintaining a presence on these platforms for social purposes. \n\nAnother perspective on this issue comes from the story of a man who demonstrated the ease with which he could gather personal information and subsequently manipulate an individual. This instance highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing online and the potential consequences of online interactions. \n\nIn a similar vein, I have encountered situations where acquaintances from classes have initiated online conversations with me despite not knowing my real name. While this can be unsettling, it also underscores the interconnectedness of online relationships and the ease with which people can obtain information about others.\n\nLastly, I recall a discussion about a high school that banned students from using Myspace, which sparked some concern regarding the school's authority over students' online activities. While I am unsure about the specifics of the situation, it raises questions about the boundaries of school administrators' power to dictate students' online behavior.",
            "The Iraq War stands as a prime example of a conflict that has garnered significant international criticism. While acknowledging the complexities surrounding the decision to invade Iraq, it is undeniable that a substantial portion of the global population holds a negative view of the war. A multitude of polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and across the globe indicate that approximately 75-80% of the population believes the war was a misstep. Furthermore, a significant percentage of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, with many advocating for a withdrawal within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been marked by a series of challenges, both prior to and following the invasion. The cultural divide between the United States and the Middle East has been a significant obstacle in the pursuit of establishing a harmonious and stable democracy in the region. The idea that Western ideals can be imposed on a society with a profoundly distinct culture and history has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile acknowledging the flaws of Saddam Hussein's regime, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of invading a country, particularly one that has become a quagmire. The decision to intervene in Iraq was met with widespread criticism, and the administration's justification for prolonging the occupation has not yet been convincing.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a feasible option, but the underlying question remains: what is the justification for staying in Iraq beyond a certain point? It is essential to consider the opinions of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for a U.S. withdrawal. In fact, a substantial percentage of Iraqis believe that the U.S. should leave immediately. This raises the question: should we not respect the will of the people we are purportedly attempting to help?\n\nIf we were to respect their opinion, it would alleviate the burden of responsibility in the event of a catastrophe. By acknowledging the Iraqi people's desire for U.S. departure, we could potentially rebrand our involvement as a benevolent and proactive measure, rather than a protracted and contentious occupation.\n\nUltimately, the Middle East remains a complex and challenging region, and the U.S. role in Iraq has been marked by controversy. While we may not be able to repair the damage done, we can at least strive to exit the situation with a sense of integrity and a recognition of the cultural and historical nuances that have shaped the conflict.",
            "The issue of gender discrimination still persists in the United States, albeit in subtle forms. While it affects both genders, its manifestations vary depending on the specific field of work and societal context. Historically, women have faced significant barriers to achieving equality, particularly in the corporate world, where the \"glass ceiling\" has prevented many from ascending to senior positions. This is due in part to the deeply ingrained notion that women are not typically suited for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women; men also face gender-based biases, albeit in different areas. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often encounter skepticism and even ridicule from society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This societal expectation can be alienating and make their choices seem invalid, even if they're driven by a desire to be actively involved in their children's lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are often stereotyped and judged based on their style and interests. Those who don't conform to traditional notions of masculinity may be viewed with suspicion or dismissed as not being \"true\" fashion enthusiasts. This narrow-mindedness can be frustrating for men who are passionate about fashion and have a deep understanding of the industry.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote a more nuanced understanding of gender roles and expectations. Rather than forcing change, we should focus on highlighting the strengths and qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped or marginalized. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive environment that values diversity and allows people to pursue their passions without fear of judgment.\n\nWhile progress has been made, it's essential to acknowledge that change takes time. The pace of progress may be slow, but it's crucial to continue working towards a more equitable society. By celebrating the achievements of individuals who challenge traditional norms and stereotypes, we can create a more accepting and inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that socioeconomic factors, such as education and geographic background, can also contribute to gender-based biases. For example, someone from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those who are more educated and from urban areas. This highlights the need for a more holistic approach to addressing gender discrimination, one that takes into account the complex interplay of factors that influence our perceptions and biases.\n\nUltimately, promoting awareness and understanding is crucial to creating a more inclusive and equitable society. By recognizing the complexities of gender-based biases and working together to challenge them, we can create a brighter future for everyone.",
            "From what I understand, the decriminalization of marijuana has essentially downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to receiving a traffic ticket. This means that instead of facing arrest and a lengthy court process, individuals can simply be cited and released. While this may eliminate some of the more severe consequences associated with a drug charge, such as the impact on future job prospects, it does not necessarily alleviate these concerns entirely.\n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the costs associated with arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals accused of marijuana possession are substantial and can be better spent on other community programs. For instance, in cities that are financially strained, the savings from decriminalization could be redirected towards education, social services, and other essential programs.\n\nDenver, a city known for its generally more progressive attitude, is a notable example of a place where decriminalization has likely freed up valuable resources for the community. By doing so, the city can invest in initiatives that benefit residents, such as food programs for the homeless and social services for the elderly.\n\nWhile some may argue that unchecked marijuana use could lead to social and public health issues, such as increased instances of driving under the influence, it is essential to consider the unique characteristics of individual users and their ability to exercise moderation. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol can have detrimental effects on individuals, but their impacts can vary greatly depending on the person. As with any substance, it is crucial to recognize that people respond differently, and some may be more prone to problematic behavior than others.\n\nBy acknowledging these complexities and nuances, we can have a more informed discussion about the role of marijuana in our society and the most effective ways to regulate its use.",
            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its long-standing customs and practices serve as a foundation for unity and continuity. However, this emphasis on tradition can sometimes hinder the Church's ability to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nI've observed that many Catholics believe it's essential to attend church services regularly, and the Church can be quite rigid in its expectations. At times, this results in a perceived disconnect between the Church's doctrine and its actions. For instance, the Church's stance on doctrine can be quite strict, leading to the exclusion of individuals who don't conform to its teachings or belong to other faiths.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' interfaith marriage. My father was an Episcopalian, and my mother was a Catholic. Due to my father's religion, they were unable to get married in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's teachings on acceptance and its practices.\n\nThe concept of loving others is a fundamental aspect of Catholicism, yet the Church's actions often seem to contradict this principle. The disconnect between doctrine and practice can be attributed to the Church's slow pace of reform. Despite its outdated practices, the Church continues to uphold them, which can be seen as hypocritical.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being married, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that allowing priests to marry would alleviate the risk of pedophilic behavior, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Those who engage in such behavior often do so for reasons unrelated to their marital status. In my opinion, the root of the problem lies elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, the decision to allow priests to marry should be based on a thorough examination of its potential consequences, rather than relying on assumptions about its impact on pedophilic behavior. It's essential to consider the complexities of the issue and the potential outcomes before making a decision.",
            "In this complex issue, I've yet to form a definitive stance on the interplay between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. While it's challenging to navigate this topic without unintentionally offending individuals, I firmly believe that the current debate surrounding marriage is among the most contentious issues we face today. \n\nOne of the primary difficulties in defining marriage lies in its delicate balance between governmental involvement and personal faith. For instance, civil unions, which are essentially partnerships between two consenting adults, often lack the tax benefits and government recognition that marriage provides. If we consider marriage as a sacred institution, as many people do, it raises questions about the role of the government in recognizing these partnerships. \n\nFrom my perspective, I think the most practical approach would be to view marriage as a civil union, devoid of the government's need to scrutinize the specifics of the union. After all, the fundamental aspect of marriage is the union of two individuals in a committed relationship. \n\nRegarding the matter of gay marriage, I believe that two consenting adults in a civil union should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as any other couple, regardless of their sexual orientation. If the majority of states can come to a logical consensus on this issue, it would be prudent to push for federal legislation that supports this cause.\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree with the notion of amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage. The constitution should not be modified lightly, and this issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic measure. In my opinion, it is not substantial enough to justify altering the fundamental document of our nation.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that the constitution should be amended to ban gay marriage. It is a matter that should be addressed through legislative channels, rather than a constitutional amendment.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household presented a complex perspective on the topic of homosexuality. As I have developed relationships with gay friends, my views have evolved to acknowledge the issue's nuance. While I may not fully endorse the lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be a matter of personal choice rather than a national debate.\n\nIn a country with diverse states, each with its own government and citizenry, it's logical that policy decisions should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government. This approach allows for a more tailored approach to accommodate regional values and preferences.\n\nSome argue that states with democratic governments will naturally be more open to recognizing gay marriage, while those with more conservative leanings may not. However, I believe individuals who choose to reside in a state with a particular stance on the issue should respect the local decision. Rather than attempting to impose a uniform policy nationwide, it's essential to grant states the autonomy to shape their own laws.\n\nThe federal government should not dictate the personal choices and values of individual states. By leaving this decision to the states, we can ensure that each region can address the issue in a way that aligns with the needs and values of its citizens.\n\nWhile some may argue that a uniform national policy would promote unity, I believe that this approach would also infringe upon the rights of states to self-govern. Ultimately, the decision on gay marriage should rest with the people who will be directly affected by it – the residents of each state. The federal government's role is to ensure that states have the freedom to make their own choices, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nIn the case of the current ban on gay marriage, I disagree with the notion that the president should have the authority to dictate a national policy. The decision should be left to the states, as they will be the ones to navigate the complexities of implementing and enforcing the policy. Furthermore, the ban is set to expire in the near future, and any future president could simply reverse it, rendering the issue subject to ongoing debate.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing each region to address the issue in a way that reflects its unique values and needs. By granting states the autonomy to make their own decisions, we can promote a more inclusive and responsive approach to this complex issue.",
            "When considering the debate over school officials' rights to monitor students' online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the public nature of social media platforms like Myspace. If a student posts content online, they should be aware that it can be accessed by anyone, including school administrators. This is particularly relevant in the context of preventing harm, such as school shootings.\n\nWhile it may be perceived as an invasion of privacy for officials to monitor students' online activity, the primary concern is the safety and well-being of students. If officials are able to identify potential issues or risks by monitoring online activity, they have a responsibility to take action to ensure a safe environment.\n\nIn fact, many schools have protocols in place to address potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency response procedures. These measures are designed to protect students and staff in the event of an emergency. By monitoring online activity, officials can identify potential issues before they escalate and take proactive steps to prevent harm.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a long-lasting impact, and online content can be easily accessible even after it's been deleted. This can lead to unintended consequences, making it essential for students to be mindful of their online presence.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure learning environment. While this may involve some measures that could be seen as invasive, the end result is a safer school community.\n\nIn a similar vein, when students are aware that their online activity is being monitored, they may be more cautious about what they post and share online. This can lead to a more responsible and respectful online culture, which is beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nBy weighing the potential benefits of monitoring online activity against the concerns about privacy, it's clear that officials have a legitimate reason to take a closer look at student online behavior. This can help prevent harm and create a safer school environment, making it a worthwhile investment of their time and resources.",
            "My thoughts on the war in the Middle East have undergone a significant shift since the events of September 11. Initially, I was deeply affected by the tragedy and supported the idea of taking decisive action against those responsible. However, as time passed, I began to question the preparation and motivations behind our involvement. It became clear that a more measured and thoughtful approach was necessary, rather than an impulsive reaction fueled by emotions.\n\nUpon reflection, it appears that we underestimated the complexities of the situation and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. Without a clear plan or sufficient understanding of the local dynamics, we entered the conflict unprepared, which ultimately led to a series of challenges and setbacks. In hindsight, it's clear that the war did not achieve its intended goals and, in fact, may have exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East is characterized by deep-seated sectarian divisions, and our involvement has not been able to bridge these gaps. Instead, it seems that our presence has become a source of further instability, allowing local factions to focus on their internal struggles rather than uniting against a common enemy. Considering this, I believe that our continued involvement is not only ineffective but also counterproductive.\n\nA key factor in the failure of our efforts is the vastly different understanding of war and its purposes held by various parties involved. For us, war is a means to an end, a way to achieve a specific goal or resolve a conflict. In contrast, for some of the local actors, war is a way of life, often driven by tribal or sectarian allegiances rather than a desire for nation-building or peace. This fundamental difference in perspective has made it challenging for us to find common ground and achieve a lasting resolution.\n\nIn retrospect, it's clear that our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a desire to respond to the trauma of 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy. While I can understand the emotional response, I believe that a more thoughtful and nuanced approach would have yielded better results. Our leaders, including President Bush, were under pressure from public opinion and the desire for swift action, which led to a rushed and poorly planned intervention.\n\nIn the end, I think it's essential to acknowledge that we cannot impose our values or systems of governance on other countries. Each nation has its unique history, culture, and path to self-determination. Our role should be to support and assist, rather than dictate, the course of events. Our continued presence in the Middle East is not only unsustainable but also counterproductive, as it perpetuates the cycle of violence and division.\n\nIn conclusion, my views on the war in the Middle East have evolved significantly over time. While I initially supported the idea of taking action, I now believe that our involvement has been misguided and that it's time for us to reassess our role in the region. By acknowledging our limitations and the complexities of the situation, we can take a more constructive approach to promoting peace and stability in the region."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church faces a challenge in adapting to the changing values of society. The institution has been experiencing a decline in its following, and I believe this can be attributed to its strict stance on several issues. The Church's views on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control are perceived as outdated by many, leading to a disconnect between the Church and its members.\n\nThe Church's traditional views may seem inflexible, causing some individuals to question their loyalty to the institution. For instance, those who support abortion rights or gay marriage may feel uncomfortable being part of a community where these practices are discouraged. Similarly, the exclusion of women from the priesthood and the prohibition on priests getting married can create a sense of isolation and disconnect.\n\nIt is worth noting that the Church's stance on these issues has been a longstanding one. However, the question remains whether a more inclusive approach would help the Church regain its footing. The presence of married priests or female priests, for instance, might not have altered the outcome in recent controversies. Nevertheless, it is an idea worth exploring.\n\nThe notion that priests are devoted to their faith and, in effect, married to God, raises questions about the feasibility of priests having a family life. Most people in the working world balance their professional commitments with personal relationships and family obligations. It seems reasonable to assume that priests could do the same, especially given their role in the community.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church must consider the need for greater flexibility and accommodation in its views and practices. By doing so, it may be able to reconnect with its members and restore its relevance in a rapidly changing world.",
            "My perspective on the matter is that I do not object to same-sex marriage. In fact, I believe individuals are born with their sexual orientation, and it is not a conscious decision they make. As such, I think it is unfair to hold them accountable for their orientation. It is illogical to assert that a man and a woman can marry, yet deny the same right to two individuals of the same sex.\n\nUpon further consideration, it becomes apparent that sexual orientation is not a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it is not something they can change at will. For instance, just as some individuals are born with a certain eye color or hair color, others are born with a same-sex orientation. It would be unfair to penalize them for this natural aspect of their identity.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not interfere with matters of personal identity. Marriage is a deeply personal issue, and the government should not dictate who can and cannot get married based on arbitrary criteria. It is not a matter of moral or national security, but rather a personal choice that should be respected.\n\nFurthermore, the government lacks the right to intervene in people's lives and dictate their relationships. Same-sex couples should not be punished or stigmatized for being who they are. Their sexual orientation is a natural aspect of their identity, and they should be free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nIn summary, I do not believe the federal government should be involved in matters of same-sex marriage. This is a personal issue that should be left to the individuals involved, and the government should respect their choices and identities.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is a matter of significant importance, warranting a reevaluation of our societal stance on the issue. There are numerous reasons why gay marriage should be recognized as a fundamental right, and it's essential to address the misconceptions surrounding this topic.\n\nOne common argument against gay marriage is that it threatens the traditional family structure. However, this viewpoint neglects the complexity of modern relationships and the diverse ways in which people form families. Homosexual couples, like their heterosexual counterparts, are united by a deep emotional bond and a commitment to one another. The idea that their relationships are inherently inferior is a flawed assumption that has been disproven by scientific studies.\n\nResearch has shown that gay couples experience the same levels of relationship satisfaction and success as heterosexual couples. They face similar challenges and share similar strengths, such as the ability to form strong emotional connections and maintain a sense of trust and commitment. These findings underscore the notion that love knows no boundaries, and that the institution of marriage should be available to all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nAnother misconception surrounding gay marriage is the idea that it's somehow incompatible with religious values. However, this notion is based on a narrow and outdated understanding of morality. In a pluralistic society, it's essential to recognize that individuals have diverse beliefs and values. The government should not impose a particular set of moral standards on its citizens, but rather respect the autonomy of each individual to make their own choices.\n\nThe argument that gay marriage is a threat to traditional family values is also misplaced. The notion that children raised by gay parents are somehow disadvantaged or at risk is not supported by empirical evidence. Studies have shown that children raised by same-sex parents experience the same level of well-being and happiness as children raised by opposite-sex parents. The key factor in a child's development is not the sexual orientation of their parents, but rather the quality of care and support they receive.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of gay marriage is not just a matter of personal preference or cultural norms, but a fundamental human right. The ability to form a lifelong commitment with the person you love is a basic aspect of human dignity, and it's the government's responsibility to ensure that all individuals have access to this right.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding the \"under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance highlights the tension between religious values and secular governance. It's hypocritical for the government to impose a particular set of moral standards on its citizens while simultaneously separating church and state. The government should focus on creating a just and inclusive society, rather than catering to the interests of a particular religious group.\n\nFinally, it's essential to acknowledge that the stigma surrounding gay people is often rooted in misinformation and prejudice. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that being gay is a result of childhood trauma or a personality defect. Rather, research suggests that sexual orientation is a natural aspect of human diversity, and that individuals should be respected and accepted for who they are.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is a matter of human rights, equality, and dignity. It's time for our society to recognize the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. By doing so, we can create a more just and inclusive society, where everyone has the opportunity to form meaningful relationships and live with dignity.",
            "I have had the opportunity to work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer, where I gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding certain substances. One particular point that struck me is that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily determine its potential benefits. While I agree that making it widely available to the public may not be ideal, I do believe that it has medicinal value that should not be overlooked.\n\nIn fact, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are used in pharmacies for their therapeutic benefits, despite being classified as restricted. The fact that these substances are subject to strict regulations and monitoring highlights the importance of finding a balance between accessibility and responsible use.\n\nSome may argue that marijuana and alcohol have different risks associated with abuse, but it's essential to recognize that both substances can be misused. A more nuanced approach would be to consider gradual, phased implementation of its legalization, rather than an abrupt change. This would allow for a shift in societal perception and a more informed understanding of its potential benefits.\n\nThe negative stigma surrounding marijuana is largely a result of its illicit status, which has led to a distorted public image. However, by acknowledging its relatively low risk compared to more hazardous substances like heroin and cocaine, we can begin to reevaluate its potential uses and benefits. By removing the stigma and promoting a more balanced understanding, individuals may be more likely to use it responsibly, particularly for medical purposes.",
            "In recent years, I've observed a noticeable shift in the way my church has adapted to the 21st century. Gone are the days of strict, traditional practices. The church has made a concerted effort to become more inclusive and welcoming to its members. I've noticed that the atmosphere has become more casual, especially during the weekends. The church now offers a \"teen mass\" that caters to the needs of younger attendees, condensing the service to a more manageable thirty-minute duration. This change has contributed to a more relaxed atmosphere, where people feel comfortable dressing in casual attire, even on Sundays.\n\nAs a result, I've seen a significant change in the way people dress for mass. Gone are the days of formal attire; now, jeans and khakis are common sights, even at morning masses. While some may view this as a negative trend, I believe it's a positive step towards creating a more approachable and inviting environment.\n\nRegarding the controversy surrounding the Catholic Church and pedophilia, I believe that the issue is more complex than simply allowing female priests or married priests. While some may argue that these changes could have prevented these instances, I'm not convinced. Pedophilia is a deeply ingrained issue that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or profession. There are married individuals who have committed these heinous crimes, and it's not as if their marital status would have prevented their actions.\n\nIn fact, if someone is predisposed to pedophilia, it's unlikely that allowing them to marry or become a priest would have altered their behavior. Pedophilia is often linked to genetic factors, and it's unlikely that a person's environment or profession can change their fundamental nature. While it's possible that a person may try to suppress their desires, it's unlikely that they would be able to completely eliminate them.\n\nIn cases where the church may have been aware of these issues and chose to cover them up, that's a different story altogether. However, I'm not convinced that these actions were either intentional or widespread. If anything, I believe that the church's efforts to address these issues and create a more welcoming environment are steps in the right direction.\n\nIn conclusion, I have few thoughts on the matter, but I do believe that the church's efforts to adapt to the 21st century are a positive step towards creating a more inclusive and welcoming community. However, I also believe that the issue of pedophilia is a complex one that cannot be solely attributed to a person's marital status or profession.",
            "While initially willing to accept the premise, I began to develop reservations about the invasion of Iraq following the 9/11 attacks. I believe the Bush administration's decision to invade was, in part, a pretext, and that pretexts often led to the war. The administration's early claims linking Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the 9/11 attacks, as well as assertions about Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction, have since been proven false. This revelation has left a lasting impression on me and sparked my concern about the Iraq war.\n\nThe Bush administration's tendency to deceive the public has been particularly striking. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence to the UN, has since acknowledged that he had doubts about the validity of the information at the time. Such actions, in my opinion, constitute a grave abuse of power and a gross disregard for the principles of governance. This disregard for the truth and the constitution has been a persistent concern since 9/11, and I believe the administration's intentions were to pursue a war agenda from the outset.\n\nFurthermore, I have come across information suggesting that the younger Bush administration had a personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, likely fueled by his father's administration's previous dealings. The administration's aim to expand the country's energy supply, as well as the underhanded manner in which they pursued this goal, has left me with a lasting sense of unease.\n\nWhile I believe the war has gone on for too long, I am also aware that a hasty withdrawal could lead to further instability and bloodshed in the short term. The proposed solution of a coalition of neighboring nations, including Syria and Saudi Arabia, presents its own set of challenges, particularly with regards to Iraq's sovereignty and the effectiveness of its interim government. The recent news reports indicate that the Parliament has struggled to function, and the influence of radical groups, such as Mugtada al-Sadr's party, continues to hinder the country's progress.\n\nThe complexity of the situation in Iraq is undeniable, and I struggle to articulate a clear solution that would address the underlying issues without causing further harm. However, I am willing to engage in a nuanced discussion about the challenges facing Iraq and the international community.",
            "As I reflect on the War in Iraq, I find myself struggling to articulate a clear stance. At its core, the conflict seems to have devolved into a complex web of motivations and expectations. Initially, I thought it was a clear-cut issue of retaliation against the country that had perpetrated the 9/11 attacks. However, the lack of a formal declaration of war by Congress has led me to question the legitimacy of our involvement.\n\nIt's clear that our presence in Iraq is driven in part by a desire to establish a democratic government, which I believe is a noble goal. However, I'm not convinced that this is a feasible or sustainable outcome, given the cultural and historical context of the region. Moreover, the human cost of the war is undeniable – families are torn apart, and innocent civilians are caught in the crossfire.\n\nWhen considering the long-term implications of our actions, I worry that our attempts to impose our values on Iraq may only serve to exacerbate the situation. The presence of extremist groups like Al-Qaeda, fueled by a deep-seated hatred of the United States, is a stark reminder that our actions can have unintended consequences.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the war in Iraq has become a protracted and multifaceted issue, with no easy solution in sight. The decision to continue or withdraw our troops is a difficult one, and I'm not convinced that there is a clear right or wrong answer. While I empathize with the families of those serving in Iraq, I also recognize the need to consider the broader implications of our actions.\n\nIn the end, I think it's essential to approach this issue with nuance and a willingness to listen to diverse perspectives. By doing so, we may be able to find a path forward that balances our interests with the needs and aspirations of the Iraqi people.",
            "The notion that a state or government should dictate what is considered lawful is a topic of significant debate. From my perspective, it seems counterintuitive to override the inherent separation of church and state as established by the constitution. This fundamental principle allows for the coexistence of diverse faiths, thereby promoting a culture of religious tolerance in the United States.\n\nA proposed amendment, aimed at restricting certain religious practices, would undermine the very fabric of this separation. Such an amendment would be at odds with the constitution's original intent and would likely serve as a unique example of government overreach, rather than a necessary regulation. It is essential to recognize that the constitution was designed to safeguard individual freedoms, not restrict them.\n\nThe reality is that various faiths have differing views on this matter. Catholics and Christians, for instance, often hold distinct stances on the issue. While some areas, such as Boston, may exhibit divergent views, this does not justify government intervention. In fact, it is the churches, not the government, that should be allowed to make decisions regarding their own practices.\n\nThe concept of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy. Any attempt to alter this fundamental aspect of the constitution would be misguided. Furthermore, I believe that such an amendment would be a rare instance of restriction imposed upon the people, rather than a check on government power.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government should not involve itself in this matter. The president's push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal conviction, rather than a genuine concern for the well-being of the nation. This perceived bias towards a specific faith over others is concerning, as it undermines the principles of equality and religious freedom that our country was founded upon.\n\nI fail to see how an amendment banning certain practices would positively impact the economy or society as a whole. In fact, it could potentially have a negative effect on the social fabric of our nation. On the other hand, allowing churches to maintain their autonomy in this matter might even have a positive impact on society.\n\nTo conclude, I firmly believe that the churches should be free to make their own decisions regarding their practices, without government interference. This approach would uphold the constitution's original intent and preserve the delicate balance between church and state.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of Government Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and it is essential to examine the motivations and consequences of this decision. Upon reflection, I firmly believe that the government was not entirely transparent with the American people regarding the reasons for the invasion. The supposed link between the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's emotional response to justify a preemptive strike.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I find it particularly troubling that the US government chose to engage in a preemptive strike. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking, with both conflicts characterized by a prolonged and costly occupation. The US government should have learned from past mistakes and acknowledged the complexity of nation-building.\n\nThe removal of Saddam Hussein's regime and the attempt to establish a democratic government in Iraq were admirable goals, but the execution was woefully inadequate. The US government underestimated the difficulty of filling the power vacuum and the chaos that would ensue. The consequences of this miscalculation have been devastating, with thousands of American lives lost and a prolonged occupation that has yet to yield a stable government.\n\nA critical examination of the war's justification reveals a far more nuanced reality. The Bush administration's claims of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction were baseless, and the true motivations behind the invasion seem to have been driven by a desire to secure Iraq's oil resources. The US government's handling of the crisis has been marred by a lack of transparency and a failure to consider alternative solutions.\n\nThe war in Iraq has been a costly and protracted conflict, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to grapple with the consequences of its actions, it is essential to reevaluate its foreign policy and consider the long-term implications of military intervention. Ultimately, the Iraq War serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of unbridled military power and the importance of careful planning and consideration in foreign policy decision-making.\n\nIn retrospect, I believe that the US government's decision to invade Iraq was a grave mistake, driven by a flawed understanding of the complexities of nation-building and a failure to consider the long-term consequences of its actions. As the world continues to navigate the aftermath of this conflict, it is essential to learn from the past and strive for a more nuanced and informed approach to international relations.",
            "I'd like to express my unwavering support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. This stance has been a constant in my perspective, rooted in the understanding that a person's sexual orientation is largely influenced by biological factors rather than societal norms. The scientific community has increasingly acknowledged this distinction, highlighting the role of genetics in shaping our identities.\n\nI firmly believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices about their relationships, unencumbered by external restrictions. It's essential to recognize that the institution of marriage is a personal matter, not a subject for the government to dictate. The separation of personal lives from public policy is a fundamental principle that I strongly advocate for.\n\nIn my community, I have witnessed firsthand the love and commitment of same-sex couples who are denied the right to formalize their relationships. These individuals, just like any others, contribute to society in meaningful ways, sharing the joys and responsibilities of family life. The notion that they should be treated as second-class citizens is not only unjust but also hurtful.\n\nThe recent attempts to define marriage according to narrow, personal agendas are misguided and demonstrate a lack of respect for the complexities of human relationships. Research has shed light on the biological underpinnings of sexual orientation, challenging simplistic explanations that attribute it to environmental factors.\n\nThe disparity in public perception is striking: while individuals can easily enter into a private marriage in many parts of the country, same-sex couples face widespread scrutiny and judgment. I believe that marriage should be a private, personal choice, free from the influence of politics and public opinion. It's time for us to recognize the inherent value of love and commitment, regardless of its expression.\n\nI am confident that, with a more nuanced understanding of human nature and a commitment to equality, we can work towards a future where all individuals are treated with dignity and respect.",
            "When something gets posted online, it becomes part of the public domain, accessible to everyone. As a resident advisor, I've encountered instances where online content has had serious consequences. For example, posting about violent or sensitive topics can spark concern among students, staff, and other stakeholders. In such cases, it's crucial for the administration to take swift action, as they cannot ignore potential threats to campus safety.\n\nThe issue of online privacy is also a concern. While social media platforms offer users a degree of control over their content, it's essential to remember that once something is online, it's no longer private. If you're hesitant to share certain information, it's best not to share it at all. Unfortunately, even well-intentioned posts can be misinterpreted, especially when taken out of context.\n\nIn our school's experience, a situation arose where a student's online comments were misinterpreted as a credible threat. The situation was eventually resolved, but it highlighted the importance of being mindful of online behavior. While school officials should not overstep their bounds by monitoring students' private online activities, they do have a responsibility to act when concerns are brought to their attention.\n\nIt's also worth noting that attempting to maintain a separate online presence, such as creating a fake social media account to interact with students, can be seen as a breach of trust. As a resident advisor, I prefer to maintain professional boundaries and avoid unnecessary involvement in students' personal lives. By doing so, I can focus on providing support and guidance without compromising my role or their autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, online content can have far-reaching consequences, and it's essential to be cautious when sharing information online. While social media can be a valuable tool for communication and self-expression, it's crucial to remember that once something is posted, it's no longer private.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its initial objectives. Although the intention to promote democracy in a country lacking a fair political system was a commendable goal, it appears that this objective has become distorted over time. I believe that the primary motivation behind the war was to rectify the undemocratic situation in Iraq, but subsequent events have led me to suspect that personal vendettas, such as those between the Bush administration and Saddam Hussein, may have played a significant role in the decision-making process.\n\nIn my opinion, the core objective of establishing democracy in Iraq was achieved within the initial stages of the conflict. The fact that the war has dragged on for over a year and a half, with no clear end in sight, has led me to believe that our motivations have become increasingly unclear. It seems that the war has become an end in itself, rather than a means to an end.\n\nIf our original goal was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, I would have supported the war as a just cause. However, I fear that our objectives have been muddled and that we are now fighting for reasons that are no longer relevant. The war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, with a desire to avoid a decisive outcome rather than to achieve a tangible goal.\n\nThe financial burden of the war has been substantial, with billions of dollars being spent on a conflict that is no longer serving its original purpose. I believe that these resources could be better allocated towards addressing pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. It is disheartening to see funds being diverted towards a war that has lost its justification, when there are so many pressing needs within our own country.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the war has outlived its purpose and that it is time for it to come to a close. The Iraqi government will eventually need to take responsibility for its own affairs, and it is our duty to prioritize our own domestic concerns, rather than perpetuating a conflict that is no longer serving the greater good.",
            "The question at hand revolves around the delicate balance between online safety and individual freedom. When personal information is shared on social media platforms such as Myspace, one must consider the fact that it is inherently accessible to a wide audience. In the case of Myspace, for instance, users require a friend request to view another user's profile, which implies a tacit consent on the part of the owner to share their information with that individual. Consequently, it is essential to acknowledge that any information posted online may be viewed by numerous people.\n\nIt is intriguing to ponder the potential implications of this dynamic. On one hand, it is possible for users to identify potential threats or warning signs by monitoring social media activity. However, this raises concerns about surveillance and the feasibility of monitoring an individual's online presence without infringing upon their right to privacy. \n\nConsidering the constraints of a school environment, it is not practicable for one person to scrutinize the online profiles of every student. Nevertheless, it is a complex issue, as it may be perceived as discriminatory to selectively monitor certain individuals. \n\nAs a user of social media platforms like Facebook, I am acutely aware of the risks associated with sharing personal information. I have taken measures to limit the visibility of my profile, but I also recognize the importance of maintaining a presence on these platforms for social purposes. \n\nAnother perspective on this issue comes from the story of a man who demonstrated the ease with which he could gather personal information and subsequently manipulate an individual. This instance highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing online and the potential consequences of online interactions. \n\nIn a similar vein, I have encountered situations where acquaintances from classes have initiated online conversations with me despite not knowing my real name. While this can be unsettling, it also underscores the interconnectedness of online relationships and the ease with which people can obtain information about others.\n\nLastly, I recall a discussion about a high school that banned students from using Myspace, which sparked some concern regarding the school's authority over students' online activities. While I am unsure about the specifics of the situation, it raises questions about the boundaries of school administrators' power to dictate students' online behavior.",
            "The Iraq War stands as a prime example of a conflict that has garnered significant international criticism. While acknowledging the complexities surrounding the decision to invade Iraq, it is undeniable that a substantial portion of the global population holds a negative view of the war. A multitude of polls conducted in the United States, Iraq, and across the globe indicate that approximately 75-80% of the population believes the war was a misstep. Furthermore, a significant percentage of U.S. troops stationed in Iraq share this sentiment, with many advocating for a withdrawal within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been marked by a series of challenges, both prior to and following the invasion. The cultural divide between the United States and the Middle East has been a significant obstacle in the pursuit of establishing a harmonious and stable democracy in the region. The idea that Western ideals can be imposed on a society with a profoundly distinct culture and history has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile acknowledging the flaws of Saddam Hussein's regime, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons of invading a country, particularly one that has become a quagmire. The decision to intervene in Iraq was met with widespread criticism, and the administration's justification for prolonging the occupation has not yet been convincing.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a feasible option, but the underlying question remains: what is the justification for staying in Iraq beyond a certain point? It is essential to consider the opinions of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for a U.S. withdrawal. In fact, a substantial percentage of Iraqis believe that the U.S. should leave immediately. This raises the question: should we not respect the will of the people we are purportedly attempting to help?\n\nIf we were to respect their opinion, it would alleviate the burden of responsibility in the event of a catastrophe. By acknowledging the Iraqi people's desire for U.S. departure, we could potentially rebrand our involvement as a benevolent and proactive measure, rather than a protracted and contentious occupation.\n\nUltimately, the Middle East remains a complex and challenging region, and the U.S. role in Iraq has been marked by controversy. While we may not be able to repair the damage done, we can at least strive to exit the situation with a sense of integrity and a recognition of the cultural and historical nuances that have shaped the conflict.",
            "The issue of gender discrimination still persists in the United States, albeit in subtle forms. While it affects both genders, its manifestations vary depending on the specific field of work and societal context. Historically, women have faced significant barriers to achieving equality, particularly in the corporate world, where the \"glass ceiling\" has prevented many from ascending to senior positions. This is due in part to the deeply ingrained notion that women are not typically suited for leadership roles.\n\nHowever, this issue is not exclusive to women; men also face gender-based biases, albeit in different areas. For instance, men who choose to stay at home and care for their children often encounter skepticism and even ridicule from society, which expects them to be the primary breadwinners. This societal expectation can be alienating and make their choices seem invalid, even if they're driven by a desire to be actively involved in their children's lives.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are often stereotyped and judged based on their style and interests. Those who don't conform to traditional notions of masculinity may be viewed with suspicion or dismissed as not being \"true\" fashion enthusiasts. This narrow-mindedness can be frustrating for men who are passionate about fashion and have a deep understanding of the industry.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote a more nuanced understanding of gender roles and expectations. Rather than forcing change, we should focus on highlighting the strengths and qualities of individuals who are often stereotyped or marginalized. By doing so, we can create a more inclusive environment that values diversity and allows people to pursue their passions without fear of judgment.\n\nWhile progress has been made, it's essential to acknowledge that change takes time. The pace of progress may be slow, but it's crucial to continue working towards a more equitable society. By celebrating the achievements of individuals who challenge traditional norms and stereotypes, we can create a more accepting and inclusive environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.\n\nIt's also worth noting that socioeconomic factors, such as education and geographic background, can also contribute to gender-based biases. For example, someone from a rural area with limited access to education may face prejudice from those who are more educated and from urban areas. This highlights the need for a more holistic approach to addressing gender discrimination, one that takes into account the complex interplay of factors that influence our perceptions and biases.\n\nUltimately, promoting awareness and understanding is crucial to creating a more inclusive and equitable society. By recognizing the complexities of gender-based biases and working together to challenge them, we can create a brighter future for everyone.",
            "From what I understand, the decriminalization of marijuana has essentially downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to receiving a traffic ticket. This means that instead of facing arrest and a lengthy court process, individuals can simply be cited and released. While this may eliminate some of the more severe consequences associated with a drug charge, such as the impact on future job prospects, it does not necessarily alleviate these concerns entirely.\n\nHowever, proponents of decriminalization argue that the costs associated with arresting, prosecuting, and housing individuals accused of marijuana possession are substantial and can be better spent on other community programs. For instance, in cities that are financially strained, the savings from decriminalization could be redirected towards education, social services, and other essential programs.\n\nDenver, a city known for its generally more progressive attitude, is a notable example of a place where decriminalization has likely freed up valuable resources for the community. By doing so, the city can invest in initiatives that benefit residents, such as food programs for the homeless and social services for the elderly.\n\nWhile some may argue that unchecked marijuana use could lead to social and public health issues, such as increased instances of driving under the influence, it is essential to consider the unique characteristics of individual users and their ability to exercise moderation. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol can have detrimental effects on individuals, but their impacts can vary greatly depending on the person. As with any substance, it is crucial to recognize that people respond differently, and some may be more prone to problematic behavior than others.\n\nBy acknowledging these complexities and nuances, we can have a more informed discussion about the role of marijuana in our society and the most effective ways to regulate its use.",
            "In my opinion, the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its long-standing customs and practices serve as a foundation for unity and continuity. However, this emphasis on tradition can sometimes hinder the Church's ability to evolve and adapt to changing circumstances.\n\nI've observed that many Catholics believe it's essential to attend church services regularly, and the Church can be quite rigid in its expectations. At times, this results in a perceived disconnect between the Church's doctrine and its actions. For instance, the Church's stance on doctrine can be quite strict, leading to the exclusion of individuals who don't conform to its teachings or belong to other faiths.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' interfaith marriage. My father was an Episcopalian, and my mother was a Catholic. Due to my father's religion, they were unable to get married in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's teachings on acceptance and its practices.\n\nThe concept of loving others is a fundamental aspect of Catholicism, yet the Church's actions often seem to contradict this principle. The disconnect between doctrine and practice can be attributed to the Church's slow pace of reform. Despite its outdated practices, the Church continues to uphold them, which can be seen as hypocritical.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests being married, I believe it's a complex topic. While some might argue that allowing priests to marry would alleviate the risk of pedophilic behavior, I'm not convinced that this would be the case. Those who engage in such behavior often do so for reasons unrelated to their marital status. In my opinion, the root of the problem lies elsewhere.\n\nUltimately, the decision to allow priests to marry should be based on a thorough examination of its potential consequences, rather than relying on assumptions about its impact on pedophilic behavior. It's essential to consider the complexities of the issue and the potential outcomes before making a decision.",
            "In this complex issue, I've yet to form a definitive stance on the interplay between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. While it's challenging to navigate this topic without unintentionally offending individuals, I firmly believe that the current debate surrounding marriage is among the most contentious issues we face today. \n\nOne of the primary difficulties in defining marriage lies in its delicate balance between governmental involvement and personal faith. For instance, civil unions, which are essentially partnerships between two consenting adults, often lack the tax benefits and government recognition that marriage provides. If we consider marriage as a sacred institution, as many people do, it raises questions about the role of the government in recognizing these partnerships. \n\nFrom my perspective, I think the most practical approach would be to view marriage as a civil union, devoid of the government's need to scrutinize the specifics of the union. After all, the fundamental aspect of marriage is the union of two individuals in a committed relationship. \n\nRegarding the matter of gay marriage, I believe that two consenting adults in a civil union should be entitled to the same rights and benefits as any other couple, regardless of their sexual orientation. If the majority of states can come to a logical consensus on this issue, it would be prudent to push for federal legislation that supports this cause.\n\nHowever, I strongly disagree with the notion of amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage. The constitution should not be modified lightly, and this issue, while significant for some, does not warrant such a drastic measure. In my opinion, it is not substantial enough to justify altering the fundamental document of our nation.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that the constitution should be amended to ban gay marriage. It is a matter that should be addressed through legislative channels, rather than a constitutional amendment.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household presented a complex perspective on the topic of homosexuality. As I have developed relationships with gay friends, my views have evolved to acknowledge the issue's nuance. While I may not fully endorse the lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be a matter of personal choice rather than a national debate.\n\nIn a country with diverse states, each with its own government and citizenry, it's logical that policy decisions should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government. This approach allows for a more tailored approach to accommodate regional values and preferences.\n\nSome argue that states with democratic governments will naturally be more open to recognizing gay marriage, while those with more conservative leanings may not. However, I believe individuals who choose to reside in a state with a particular stance on the issue should respect the local decision. Rather than attempting to impose a uniform policy nationwide, it's essential to grant states the autonomy to shape their own laws.\n\nThe federal government should not dictate the personal choices and values of individual states. By leaving this decision to the states, we can ensure that each region can address the issue in a way that aligns with the needs and values of its citizens.\n\nWhile some may argue that a uniform national policy would promote unity, I believe that this approach would also infringe upon the rights of states to self-govern. Ultimately, the decision on gay marriage should rest with the people who will be directly affected by it – the residents of each state. The federal government's role is to ensure that states have the freedom to make their own choices, rather than imposing a one-size-fits-all solution.\n\nIn the case of the current ban on gay marriage, I disagree with the notion that the president should have the authority to dictate a national policy. The decision should be left to the states, as they will be the ones to navigate the complexities of implementing and enforcing the policy. Furthermore, the ban is set to expire in the near future, and any future president could simply reverse it, rendering the issue subject to ongoing debate.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that the decision on gay marriage should be left to the individual states, allowing each region to address the issue in a way that reflects its unique values and needs. By granting states the autonomy to make their own decisions, we can promote a more inclusive and responsive approach to this complex issue.",
            "When considering the debate over school officials' rights to monitor students' online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the public nature of social media platforms like Myspace. If a student posts content online, they should be aware that it can be accessed by anyone, including school administrators. This is particularly relevant in the context of preventing harm, such as school shootings.\n\nWhile it may be perceived as an invasion of privacy for officials to monitor students' online activity, the primary concern is the safety and well-being of students. If officials are able to identify potential issues or risks by monitoring online activity, they have a responsibility to take action to ensure a safe environment.\n\nIn fact, many schools have protocols in place to address potential threats, such as lockdown drills and emergency response procedures. These measures are designed to protect students and staff in the event of an emergency. By monitoring online activity, officials can identify potential issues before they escalate and take proactive steps to prevent harm.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a long-lasting impact, and online content can be easily accessible even after it's been deleted. This can lead to unintended consequences, making it essential for students to be mindful of their online presence.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials monitoring online activity should be to create a safer and more secure learning environment. While this may involve some measures that could be seen as invasive, the end result is a safer school community.\n\nIn a similar vein, when students are aware that their online activity is being monitored, they may be more cautious about what they post and share online. This can lead to a more responsible and respectful online culture, which is beneficial for everyone involved.\n\nBy weighing the potential benefits of monitoring online activity against the concerns about privacy, it's clear that officials have a legitimate reason to take a closer look at student online behavior. This can help prevent harm and create a safer school environment, making it a worthwhile investment of their time and resources.",
            "My thoughts on the war in the Middle East have undergone a significant shift since the events of September 11. Initially, I was deeply affected by the tragedy and supported the idea of taking decisive action against those responsible. However, as time passed, I began to question the preparation and motivations behind our involvement. It became clear that a more measured and thoughtful approach was necessary, rather than an impulsive reaction fueled by emotions.\n\nUpon reflection, it appears that we underestimated the complexities of the situation and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. Without a clear plan or sufficient understanding of the local dynamics, we entered the conflict unprepared, which ultimately led to a series of challenges and setbacks. In hindsight, it's clear that the war did not achieve its intended goals and, in fact, may have exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe conflict in the Middle East is characterized by deep-seated sectarian divisions, and our involvement has not been able to bridge these gaps. Instead, it seems that our presence has become a source of further instability, allowing local factions to focus on their internal struggles rather than uniting against a common enemy. Considering this, I believe that our continued involvement is not only ineffective but also counterproductive.\n\nA key factor in the failure of our efforts is the vastly different understanding of war and its purposes held by various parties involved. For us, war is a means to an end, a way to achieve a specific goal or resolve a conflict. In contrast, for some of the local actors, war is a way of life, often driven by tribal or sectarian allegiances rather than a desire for nation-building or peace. This fundamental difference in perspective has made it challenging for us to find common ground and achieve a lasting resolution.\n\nIn retrospect, it's clear that our initial decision to go to war was driven by a desire for revenge and a desire to respond to the trauma of 9/11, rather than a carefully considered strategy. While I can understand the emotional response, I believe that a more thoughtful and nuanced approach would have yielded better results. Our leaders, including President Bush, were under pressure from public opinion and the desire for swift action, which led to a rushed and poorly planned intervention.\n\nIn the end, I think it's essential to acknowledge that we cannot impose our values or systems of governance on other countries. Each nation has its unique history, culture, and path to self-determination. Our role should be to support and assist, rather than dictate, the course of events. Our continued presence in the Middle East is not only unsustainable but also counterproductive, as it perpetuates the cycle of violence and division.\n\nIn conclusion, my views on the war in the Middle East have evolved significantly over time. While I initially supported the idea of taking action, I now believe that our involvement has been misguided and that it's time for us to reassess our role in the region. By acknowledging our limitations and the complexities of the situation, we can take a more constructive approach to promoting peace and stability in the region."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces a challenge in retaining its following due to its stance on certain issues.  One reason for this decline may be the Church's reluctance to adapt to changing societal values.  Specifically, its views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have led to a growing divergence between the Church and its adherents.  While the Church's strong stance on these matters is understandable, its views may be seen as outdated by some.\n\nAs a result, individuals who hold different opinions on these issues may feel uneasy about affiliating with the Church.  For instance, those who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage may find it difficult to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, the Church's stance on these issues may deter individuals who value inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Catholic Church's reluctance to ordain female priests and permit priests to marry is another area of contention.  While some may argue that these changes would not have prevented past controversies, it is worth considering whether greater flexibility in these areas could help the Church stay relevant.  After all, many professionals in other fields balance their work and personal lives, and there is no reason why priests should be held to a different standard.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church's stance on these issues may be a major factor in its declining popularity.  By adopting a more inclusive and flexible approach, the Church may be able to reconnect with its followers and attract a new generation of adherents.  However, this would require the Church to re-examine its traditional views and consider the changing values of modern society.",
            "In my opinion, the issue of gay marriage is a complex one. However, I do not believe that individuals have a choice in their sexual orientation. I think it's essential to recognize that people are born with their orientation, and it's not a decision they make consciously.\n\nI also believe that it's unfair to hold someone accountable for their sexual orientation. It's not something they can change, and it's not something they should be judged for. The idea that a couple of the same sex cannot marry while a heterosexual couple can seems discriminatory and unjust.\n\nI think it's essential to separate the issue of gay marriage from the concept of the federal government's involvement. I don't believe that this is a matter of national security or moral obligation, but rather a personal right that individuals should have the freedom to exercise. The government should not interfere with people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal choices and relationships.\n\nIt's crucial to respect people's differences and not judge them based on their orientation. Gay people are not making a choice, and they should not be punished for being who they are. Ultimately, I think the federal government should stay out of this issue, as it's a matter of individual freedom and human rights.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientation is not a choice, and they should be free to live their lives without judgment or persecution.",
            "I firmly believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, not only for the sake of equality but also due to the numerous benefits it would bring to society. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families. However, this notion is inherently flawed, as it disregards the diversity and individuality of relationships.\n\nLike two sides of the same coin, heterosexual and homosexual relationships share many commonalities. They both involve commitment, love, and a deep emotional bond. The notion that homosexual couples are inherently different is unfounded, and the legal recognition of their relationships should not be denied.\n\nOne of the critical issues that arise when discussing same-sex marriage is the lack of recognition of partners in times of need. For instance, if a partner is hospitalized, their loved one may be denied visitation rights due to not being considered a family member. This is not only unfair but also highlights the need for equal treatment under the law.\n\nScientific studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples face the same challenges and have the same level of relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to marry in a church; rather, they seek a legal document that recognizes their commitment to one another.\n\nThe separation of church and state is often cited as a reason for opposing same-sex marriage. However, this argument is misinformed, as the government's role is to provide a legal framework for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By allowing civil unions, but not marriage, the government is perpetuating a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nThe concerns surrounding adoption and children's well-being are valid, but they are being fueled by misinformation. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as those raised by heterosexual parents. Additionally, many communities have successfully integrated same-sex families, and schools have implemented inclusive policies to support these families.\n\nThe federal government should take a proactive approach to address this issue by making same-sex marriage legal in all states. The current amendment restricting marriage to heterosexual couples is not only unjust but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"Under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome argue that gay people are psychologically damaged or born with a \"defect.\" However, this notion is debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association. It is essential to listen to evidence-based research rather than relying on personal opinions and cultural norms.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more inclusive and just society. It is time for the government to take a stand and ensure that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits and protections as everyone else.",
            "In my experience working at a hospital pharmacy, I've gained a unique perspective on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and societal perceptions. While certain substances are prohibited due to their illicit nature, it's essential to acknowledge their potential benefits. In my opinion, making such substances available to the public without proper regulation would be unwise. However, I firmly believe that their medicinal properties warrant consideration for controlled medical use. The fact that a substance is prohibited doesn't inherently negate its potential advantages.\n\nInterestingly, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are commonly used in pharmacies due to their therapeutic value. These substances are subject to strict regulations, but their benefits cannot be denied. If we can accept the legitimacy of these controlled substances, it's equally important to reevaluate the stigma surrounding marijuana. By recognizing its potential benefits, we can work towards a more informed and nuanced understanding of its use.\n\nOne key difference between marijuana and other substances like alcohol lies in their potential for abuse. While excessive use of either substance can lead to negative consequences, it's crucial to acknowledge the distinct risks associated with each. A gradual introduction of marijuana into the mainstream, accompanied by education and regulation, could potentially mitigate abuse and promote responsible use.\n\nThe widespread negative image surrounding marijuana is largely due to its illicit status. However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction and address the misconceptions surrounding this substance. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively low. By dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding marijuana, we can foster a more responsible and informed approach to its use.",
            "The Catholic Church has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the changing times, embracing a more modern and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the strict traditions of the past, replaced by a more casual and inclusive environment. My personal experiences attending church services have shown a notable shift in the way people dress and interact with one another. What used to be a formal affair has given way to a more laid-back atmosphere, especially during the summer months when people often attend in casual beachwear.\n\nThis change is evident not only in the dress code but also in the overall tone of the services. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it more accessible to those with busy schedules, allowing them to participate in their faith without feeling obligated to adhere to a strict time commitment. The presence of families and children has also become more prominent, which is a positive development in creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nWhile I am not well-versed in the inner workings of the church's politics, I can speak to the issue of clergy misconduct. In my opinion, the recent scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church are a complex issue with deep-seated causes. I do not believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining female priests would have been a solution to this problem. Research suggests that pedophilia is a pre-existing condition, often linked to genetic factors, rather than a result of environmental influences. While marriage may provide a sense of fulfillment and stability for some individuals, it is unlikely to alter their inherent tendencies.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that clergy misconduct is not exclusive to the Catholic Church, and it is not solely the result of their celibacy or lack thereof. Rather, it is a symptom of a broader societal issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. If the church or any institution is aware of such misconduct and attempts to cover it up, it is indeed shameful. However, I do not believe that the root cause of this issue lies in the church's policies regarding marriage or ordination.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church has made strides in adapting to the modern world, the issue of clergy misconduct is a more complex and deeply ingrained problem that cannot be simply resolved by altering its practices. Ultimately, it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.",
            "The Iraq war has left a lasting impression on me, and while I initially supported the premise of military action, I have serious concerns about the motivations behind it. Following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration hastily linked Iraq to the terrorist threat, asserting the existence of weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been thoroughly discredited. This deliberate misrepresentation of facts has been a source of great frustration for me.\n\nThe administration's propensity for deception is particularly disturbing, especially given the dire consequences. Colin Powell's subsequent admission that he was unconvinced by the evidence he presented to the UN highlights the scope of this issue. I believe that such deliberate falsehoods are a serious breach of the public's trust and an impeachable offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution has been alarming, particularly in its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th. It is clear that their intention from the outset was to pursue a war in Iraq.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, including a former treasury secretary, George W. Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein may have been driven in part by a desire to expand the country's energy supply. This underhanded motive has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region.\n\nWhile it is true that a sudden withdrawal from Iraq could lead to civil war and further bloodshed, I believe that the current situation has dragged on for far too long. The proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, may not be the most effective or sustainable approach. Iraq's sovereignty will likely remain a contentious issue, and the current interim government's ineffectiveness has exacerbated the problem.\n\nNews reports indicate that the Iraqi Parliament is struggling to assert its authority, and the Prime Minister's influence is being undermined by radical factions vying for control. This fractious environment has hindered the country's development and is an obstacle to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the complexities of the Iraq situation are multifaceted and far-reaching. While I can't articulate a clear-cut solution, I firmly believe that the current path is unsustainable, and a more constructive approach is needed to address the ongoing conflict.",
            "One of the most contentious issues of our time is the War in Iraq. I'm not quite sure where to begin, but I'll try to provide some insight into my perspective.\n\nInitially, I felt that the war was somewhat pointless, given that it wasn't officially declared. It seemed to me that the primary motivation was to retaliate against the country perceived to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Consequently, I didn't closely follow the developments of the war.\n\nHowever, I've come to understand that our presence in Iraq is largely aimed at establishing democracy and securing oil resources. While this may not be the most compelling reason to continue the war, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities involved. On one hand, staying in Iraq would allow us to create a stable democracy, albeit a lengthy and challenging process. On the other hand, our prolonged presence could be seen as an attempt to mold Iraq into a replica of the United States, potentially exacerbating the situation.\n\nMoreover, the war has significant humanitarian consequences, including the displacement of children from their families and the disruption of education. It's essential to consider the impact of our actions on the Iraqi people and the potential for the Al-Qaeda insurgency to grow stronger due to our intervention.\n\nI've come to realize that this conflict is not as black-and-white as it seems. As a nation, we must weigh the pros and cons of our involvement and consider the long-term effects on both the Iraqis and ourselves. In my opinion, the war has the potential to become a long and arduous process, with uncertain outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lack of congressional declaration has raised questions about the legitimacy of the war. As a nation, we should strive to operate within the bounds of our democratic institutions and respect the principles of our government.\n\nUltimately, the decision to continue or withdraw from Iraq is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. While I'm not an expert on the topic, I believe that our actions should be guided by empathy for the Iraqi people and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.",
            "There is a strong argument to be made that government involvement in matters of religious beliefs can be problematic. The constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state suggests that it is not the role of the government to dictate what is or is not acceptable within religious institutions. This separation has been a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to practice their faith without fear of government interference.\n\nThe idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices could be seen as contradictory to the principles enshrined in the constitution. Such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, undermining the very foundation of our democratic system. Furthermore, the motivations behind such a move would need to be carefully examined, particularly if they are driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nIn the context of the proposed amendment, it is essential to consider the potential impact on society. While the economic implications are unclear, it is possible that recognizing and respecting individual freedoms of faith could have a positive effect on the social fabric of our nation. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed should be left to the churches and their respective congregations, rather than being dictated by government edict.\n\nThe notion that the federal government or any public official should impose their will on matters of faith is concerning, especially when it appears to be driven by personal biases rather than a desire to serve the greater good. By respecting the separation of church and state, we can promote a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there may be valid concerns, it is essential to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal agendas to drive policy decisions.",
            "The Iraq War has left a profound impact on the world, sparking intense debates and raising questions about the motivations behind the conflict. In my opinion, the government's initial justification for the invasion was not entirely transparent to the American people. The administration's attempt to link the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and it played on the public's emotions to garner support for the war.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was critical of the invasion from the start. The war in Iraq shares eerie similarities with the Vietnam War, where the government underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges of implementing democracy in a foreign country. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was a significant challenge, and the US government was not adequately prepared for the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe consequences of the war have been dire, with countless American lives lost and ongoing efforts to train the Iraqi military and police forces. The US government's assumption that the invasion would be a swift and successful endeavor was overly optimistic, given the historical precedents of similar conflicts.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is clear that the government's decision-making process was flawed. The Bush administration's claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false, raises concerns about the government's honesty and thoroughness in its decision-making. Furthermore, the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not the target of similar military actions, suggests a potential motive driven by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to spread democracy.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Iraq has raised difficult questions about the morality of military intervention and the true motivations behind it. While it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility towards the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly as a result of the invasion, the human cost of the war cannot be ignored. As the war enters its second decade, it is essential to re-examine the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nThe Iraq War has also sparked discussions about the role of oil and resources in international relations. The fact that Iraq is a significant oil producer and the US government's stated reason for the invasion was to spread democracy and remove a \"rogue\" regime, while conveniently overlooking other countries with similar characteristics, raises suspicions about the true motives behind the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict continues, I can only hope that a peaceful resolution is reached, and the Iraqi people can finally find stability and security. However, the path forward is uncertain, and it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges involved in creating a democratic government in a country ravaged by war.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage has been unwavering throughout my life. I firmly believe that an individual's sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and it should not be subject to societal or governmental restrictions. Recent scientific research has shed light on the biological factors contributing to an individual's sexual orientation, suggesting that it may not be entirely a matter of upbringing or social conditioning.\n\nIn my opinion, it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something that is largely beyond their control. I strongly advocate for the rights of same-sex couples to be recognized and respected.\n\nThe issue here is not about politics or government intervention, but rather about allowing individuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. I have witnessed firsthand the normalcy of same-sex relationships in my community, where gay couples live and interact with their neighbors just like any other family unit. It's time for our society to acknowledge and accept this reality.\n\nThe concept of marriage should be private and personal, not subject to public scrutiny or governmental regulations. If a heterosexual couple can choose to get married without drawing attention to themselves, why should the same not be true for same-sex couples? It's a matter of equality and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nWhile some may argue that marriage is a social construct, I believe that it is a fundamental human right that should be accessible to all, regardless of one's sexual orientation. By recognizing this, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One of the challenges of online communication is that once you share something on the internet, it becomes a matter of public record. As someone who has experience in a residential advisor role, I've seen firsthand how this can be a concern. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and in some cases, it can have serious consequences.\n\nFor instance, if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, it's likely to attract attention from others. Someone might report it to the authorities or school administrators, who then have to take action. This is because the internet is a publicly accessible space, and any content you post can be seen by a wide audience.\n\nI recall an incident at my school where a student made a comment that was misinterpreted as a threat. An overheard conversation was reported to the authorities, and after investigating, it was discovered that the student had posted something online that was meant as a joke. However, in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe key point to remember is that once you post something online, you're giving up a level of control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want people to know something about you, it's best not to post it online. You can't dictate how others will react to what you share, and you can't force them to take it lightly.\n\nWhile I don't think it's appropriate for school officials to be friends with students on social media or monitoring their online activity without consent, if a concern is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take action. This is especially true if there's a potential threat to safety.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, I believe it's best for educators to maintain a professional distance from their students online. As an R.A., I don't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to intrude on their personal lives or be privy to information that might create a conflict of interest. By keeping a professional boundary, I can focus on supporting their academic and personal growth without compromising our relationship.",
            "The ongoing conflict has become excessively prolonged, deviating from its original intent. Initially, the objective was to establish democracy in a country plagued by an unfair political system, a goal that warrants consideration. However, over time, the mission seems to have lost its focus, and the driving force behind it appears to have shifted from promoting democracy to showcasing military prowess.\n\nThe motives behind the initial invasion are also suspect, particularly considering the historical tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While an altruistic aim to establish democracy is understandable, it becomes questionable when personal vendettas are involved.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the war made a significant statement, highlighting the determination to intervene. Nonetheless, the prolonged duration, spanning several years, has led to a protracted and increasingly costly endeavor. It is arguable that the purpose has been undermined, and the war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, driven by the desire to maintain a military presence rather than to achieve a decisive victory.\n\nThe financial burden of this conflict is substantial, diverting billions of dollars from domestic priorities such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and healthcare. These domestic issues, such as public roads, education, and healthcare, are pressing concerns that require attention and funding. It is imperative to reassess the allocation of resources, prioritizing the needs of our own citizens over the prolonged engagement in a foreign conflict. Ultimately, the war has become a costly and seemingly futile endeavor, draining our economy and diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.",
            "When considering whether a student's online profile or activity can be monitored to prevent harm, several factors come into play. For instance, social media platforms like Myspace often require users to allow others to access their profiles by accepting them as friends or acquaintances. In doing so, individuals essentially grant permission for those individuals to view their personal information.\n\nThis raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be traced and monitored. While it's impossible to have a single person continuously monitor every student's online presence, it's also not feasible to simply block certain individuals from accessing the internet. Instead, schools might consider implementing guidelines or policies regarding online safety and responsible behavior.\n\nSome argue that schools have a responsibility to protect students from potential harm, particularly if they have reason to believe that a student may be in danger. In this context, monitoring online activity might be justified. However, this raises issues of privacy and potential discrimination. Schools would need to carefully weigh the benefits of monitoring against the potential risks and ensure that any policies are fair and applied consistently.\n\nThe boundaries between personal and public spaces online are increasingly blurred. Platforms like Myspace and Facebook expose users to a wide audience, and individuals may share personal information without fully realizing its accessibility. This can be concerning, especially considering the ease with which strangers can gather information about others online.\n\nA notable example of this vulnerability can be seen in cases where individuals have used social media to gather sensitive information about others. For instance, a recent television program demonstrated how a person was able to gather a stranger's screen name and establish contact through instant messaging. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing personal details online.\n\nMany students, including myself, have Myspace profiles to connect with friends and maintain social relationships. However, this also means that we must navigate the risks associated with online sharing. It's essential to strike a balance between opening ourselves up to others and protecting our personal information.\n\nIn some cases, schools may restrict access to social media platforms, as was the case in my roommate's high school. While this may seem like an overreach, it also raises important questions about the boundaries between school and personal life. I'm not sure whether it's a matter of privacy or authority, but it's certainly a complex issue.\n\nOverall, the intersection of online safety, privacy, and responsibility is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and it's difficult to approach the subject without acknowledging the complex web of opinions surrounding it. As someone who has grappled with the nuances of this issue, I find myself reflecting on the overwhelming consensus that the war was a misguided endeavor. The vast majority of global polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and internationally, suggest that upwards of 75-80% of the population believes the war was a miscalculation.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by a significant portion of the US military personnel currently stationed in Iraq, with around 70% expressing the opinion that the war was a mistake and that withdrawal within the year is the most prudent course of action. The fact that the war has been widely regarded as a disaster from its inception, with no clear path forward for a successful exit, highlights the enormity of the challenge.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this debacle is the profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region with such a distinct cultural identity is a notion that has been repeatedly proven flawed. The previous administration's decision to invade Iraq was based on a simplistic understanding of the local context, which overlooked the complexities of the region.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, any evaluation of the war's justification requires a balanced consideration of the potential consequences. The catastrophic outcome that unfolded was predictable, and it's essential to acknowledge that the war was not a well-thought-out decision.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, it's becoming increasingly clear that there is no compelling argument to justify an extended US presence. The administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal over a year or more may be a step in the right direction, but the fundamental question remains: what is the purpose of our continued involvement? The voices of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for our departure, should be given significant weight in this decision. It's time to listen to their perspective and recognize that they may possess a deeper understanding of their own situation.\n\nUltimately, if we were to ask the Iraqi people whether they want us to leave, and they respond with a resounding \"yes,\" it would provide a clear justification for our exit. This approach would also absolve us of any potential blame for the consequences of our departure. If we were to decide to assist the Iraqi people after we leave, we could at least do so in a position of moral clarity, rather than being seen as occupying forces.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complicated and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our continued involvement is no longer justified. It's time for us to listen to the voices of the Iraqi people and to reevaluate our role in this conflict.",
            "Gender inequality remains a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in certain professional settings. It's not limited to women, as various fields, including the corporate world, fashion, and even parenting, exhibit inherent biases. The \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women face obstacles in advancing to leadership positions, is a notable example. \n\nWhile societal norms have evolved over time, deeply ingrained attitudes persist. Women are often held to a higher standard, with their professional abilities being scrutinized more closely than men's. Conversely, men who choose to stay at home to raise their children face stigma, as people often expect them to be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are passionate about fashion may be perceived as less credible due to traditional stereotypes. This can be overcome by highlighting the qualities and expertise of individuals who defy these expectations. A gradual shift in societal attitudes is underway, with more people accepting women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads. However, promoting this change requires a delicate approach, as forced efforts can lead to resistance.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic factors can also contribute to inequality. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of gender, may face prejudice based on their educational background or communication skills. For instance, a CEO from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged on their ability to articulate their thoughts, rather than their intelligence or business acumen.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that inequality is not limited to gender; various factors, including socioeconomic status and geographical background, can also contribute to prejudice. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the complexities of societal attitudes and the need for gradual change.",
            "There seems to be a shift in the way the law addresses marijuana possession, from treating it as a criminal offense to a more minor infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change is significant, as it spares individuals from the more severe consequences associated with a criminal charge, such as arrest and court appearances. However, the long-term implications of a decriminalized marijuana policy can still be a concern for those who worry about its impact on their future, particularly in the context of employment and other professional opportunities.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of decriminalization is that it can help alleviate the financial burden on local law enforcement and the judicial system. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession can be resource-intensive and costly. By reducing the number of arrests and court appearances, municipalities can redirect these resources to more pressing community needs, such as public education, social programs, and support services for vulnerable populations.\n\nDenver's approach to marijuana decriminalization is a notable example of this strategy. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana possession, the city has been able to free up resources for more constructive purposes. This is particularly relevant in areas where communities have traditionally been skeptical of marijuana use.\n\nWhile there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of widespread marijuana use, such as increased accidents and public health issues, it's essential to consider the complexities of individual reactions to the substance. People's responses to marijuana can vary greatly, and some may be more susceptible to its effects than others. Moreover, attitudes towards marijuana use are often influenced by cultural and personal factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize marijuana is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks. By considering the financial, social, and individual implications, we can work towards a more informed and evidence-based approach to marijuana policy.",
            "While I acknowledge the importance of tradition in many aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that a balance between preserving heritage and embracing change is crucial. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally essential to adapt to evolving societal norms and values.\n\nOne aspect that has always puzzled me is the perceived disconnect between Catholic doctrine and its application. On one hand, the Church emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, as seen in its teachings on tolerance and compassion. On the other hand, certain practices, such as excluding individuals from the community due to their religious background or perceived imperfections, seem to contradict this message.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' situation. As an Episcopalian, my father was not eligible for a Catholic ceremony, despite my mother's Catholic faith and my own upbringing in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's ideals of acceptance and its more rigid practices.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I think it's essential to consider the potential impact on the institution. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could alleviate certain problems, such as pedophilia, I'm not convinced that this would be a solution. The complexities of human behavior are multifaceted, and individuals who engage in such reprehensible actions are likely driven by factors beyond their marital status.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the Catholic Church should strive to reconcile its doctrine with its practices, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all members of the community.",
            "The issue of church and state separation is especially challenging when considering the definition of marriage. Balancing the involvement of the government in this matter can be delicate, as it involves determining the extent to which a personal, deeply held institution should be regulated by the state. The government's role in recognizing and defining marriage is a complex issue that must be approached with sensitivity.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider the distinction between civil unions and marriage. In this context, marriage is seen as a sacrament or a deeply personal commitment between two individuals, rather than a solely governmental concern. This perspective suggests that the government's role should be limited to recognizing and enforcing the legal aspects of a union, rather than imposing its own definition of what constitutes a valid marriage.\n\nIf the primary focus is on the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, then perhaps it would be more practical to view it as a civil union. This approach would allow the government to maintain a neutral stance on the issue, avoiding entanglement in the deeply personal and often contentious aspects of religious belief.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in defining marriage. If the goal is to establish a uniform national standard, it may be more effective to work towards a federal law that addresses the issue, rather than relying on individual state-by-state solutions.\n\nHowever, amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it represents a significant manipulation of the fundamental document. The constitution should be amended only when dealing with matters of grave national importance, and this issue, while significant to some, may not meet that threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the definition of marriage and the government's role in it is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. A more nuanced approach, focusing on the separation of church and state, and recognizing the complexities of the issue, may be more beneficial than imposing a broad, sweeping solution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have navigated the complexities of homosexuality through various perspectives. Having close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of the issue. While I may not personally adhere to the same lifestyle, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding their personal lives.\n\nIn a democratic society, it is essential to respect the autonomy of each state in making decisions that affect its citizens. By decentralizing the decision-making process, we can ensure that each region's values and values-based policies are reflected in their laws. This approach also acknowledges the diverse nature of the country, where different states have different cultural, social, and political landscapes.\n\nMy stance on gay marriage is founded on the principle of equality and individual freedom. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, deserves the same opportunities and rights. The decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to each state, allowing them to align their laws with their unique values and societal norms. This approach promotes inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for diversity.\n\nRegarding the current federal ban on gay marriage, I don't believe it is the president's role to impose a uniform stance across the country. Each state should have the authority to make its own decisions, free from federal interference. This would enable states to adapt to the changing values and needs of their citizens. Moreover, as the president's term is limited, I believe that the decision should be left to the next administration, ensuring a more transparent and democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a decentralized approach to addressing gay marriage, allowing each state to chart its own course. This approach honors the diversity of the country and promotes a more inclusive and respectful society for all individuals.",
            "In reflecting on the issue of school officials monitoring student activity on online platforms like Myspace, I must consider the balance between personal freedom and school safety. On one hand, Myspace is a public forum where users post content for the world to see. If a student shares information on this platform, they should be aware that it may be accessed by not only their peers but also school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety. If monitoring Myspace helps identify potential concerns or issues that could compromise school security, I think it's reasonable for officials to take notice. Even if the content is not posted under the school's name, they may still be able to access it through their own means.\n\nSome might argue that monitoring student online activity is an invasion of privacy. However, I'd like to propose that this perspective is shortsighted. If officials can use this information to prevent harm and create a safer school environment, I don't believe it's an unreasonable intrusion. In fact, I've spoken to a teacher who shared that they perform online monitoring to detect potential issues, such as substance abuse or other illicit activities.\n\nThis is not entirely unlike the lockdown drills we had in my high school, which were implemented in response to concerns about terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to the issue at hand, they demonstrate the school's commitment to ensuring student safety. By monitoring Myspace, officials are essentially taking a similar proactive approach.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in today's digital age, online content can be enduring and far-reaching. A single post or email can resurface years down the line and cause unintended consequences. This reality underscores the importance of responsible online behavior.\n\nUltimately, I believe that school officials have a responsibility to create a safe environment for their students. If monitoring online activity helps them achieve this goal, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of students.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective on the war. Initially, I was convinced that a swift and decisive action was necessary to rectify the situation. However, as I began to consider the potential consequences, I started to question the efficacy of our approach. It became apparent that a more measured and thoughtful strategy was required, taking into account the complexities of the region and the people involved.\n\nUpon reflection, I believe that our actions were motivated by a mix of emotions, including a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency to address the atrocity that had occurred. While I understand the sentiment behind this reaction, I now think that it led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the long-term effects of our intervention.\n\nThe fact that the people in the region are often at odds with one another is a significant factor in the ongoing conflict. It seems that as long as they are preoccupied with internal struggles, they are less likely to pose a threat to us. In this context, I question the value of our presence in the region. Rather than trying to impose our values and customs, we might be better off focusing on our own interests and security.\n\nI also think that we underestimated the cultural and historical context of war in that part of the world. The concept of conflict and violence is deeply ingrained in their society, and it's unrealistic to expect that we can change this overnight. In many ways, their approach to war is shaped by their unique cultural and historical experiences, and it's not necessarily comparable to our own experiences.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were motivated by a desire for revenge and a sense of national pride, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. This led to a hasty and ill-prepared intervention, which ultimately had unintended consequences. We should have taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the local dynamics and the potential outcomes of our actions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we made some progress in the region, I believe that it's time for us to reassess our presence and consider a more measured withdrawal. The reality is that we cannot stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued presence may actually hinder the local population's ability to govern themselves. It's in our best interest to focus on our own security and interests, rather than trying to impose our will on a region that is fundamentally different from our own."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces a challenge in retaining its following due to its stance on certain issues.  One reason for this decline may be the Church's reluctance to adapt to changing societal values.  Specifically, its views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have led to a growing divergence between the Church and its adherents.  While the Church's strong stance on these matters is understandable, its views may be seen as outdated by some.\n\nAs a result, individuals who hold different opinions on these issues may feel uneasy about affiliating with the Church.  For instance, those who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage may find it difficult to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, the Church's stance on these issues may deter individuals who value inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Catholic Church's reluctance to ordain female priests and permit priests to marry is another area of contention.  While some may argue that these changes would not have prevented past controversies, it is worth considering whether greater flexibility in these areas could help the Church stay relevant.  After all, many professionals in other fields balance their work and personal lives, and there is no reason why priests should be held to a different standard.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church's stance on these issues may be a major factor in its declining popularity.  By adopting a more inclusive and flexible approach, the Church may be able to reconnect with its followers and attract a new generation of adherents.  However, this would require the Church to re-examine its traditional views and consider the changing values of modern society.",
            "In my opinion, the issue of gay marriage is a complex one. However, I do not believe that individuals have a choice in their sexual orientation. I think it's essential to recognize that people are born with their orientation, and it's not a decision they make consciously.\n\nI also believe that it's unfair to hold someone accountable for their sexual orientation. It's not something they can change, and it's not something they should be judged for. The idea that a couple of the same sex cannot marry while a heterosexual couple can seems discriminatory and unjust.\n\nI think it's essential to separate the issue of gay marriage from the concept of the federal government's involvement. I don't believe that this is a matter of national security or moral obligation, but rather a personal right that individuals should have the freedom to exercise. The government should not interfere with people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal choices and relationships.\n\nIt's crucial to respect people's differences and not judge them based on their orientation. Gay people are not making a choice, and they should not be punished for being who they are. Ultimately, I think the federal government should stay out of this issue, as it's a matter of individual freedom and human rights.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientation is not a choice, and they should be free to live their lives without judgment or persecution.",
            "I firmly believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, not only for the sake of equality but also due to the numerous benefits it would bring to society. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families. However, this notion is inherently flawed, as it disregards the diversity and individuality of relationships.\n\nLike two sides of the same coin, heterosexual and homosexual relationships share many commonalities. They both involve commitment, love, and a deep emotional bond. The notion that homosexual couples are inherently different is unfounded, and the legal recognition of their relationships should not be denied.\n\nOne of the critical issues that arise when discussing same-sex marriage is the lack of recognition of partners in times of need. For instance, if a partner is hospitalized, their loved one may be denied visitation rights due to not being considered a family member. This is not only unfair but also highlights the need for equal treatment under the law.\n\nScientific studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples face the same challenges and have the same level of relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to marry in a church; rather, they seek a legal document that recognizes their commitment to one another.\n\nThe separation of church and state is often cited as a reason for opposing same-sex marriage. However, this argument is misinformed, as the government's role is to provide a legal framework for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By allowing civil unions, but not marriage, the government is perpetuating a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nThe concerns surrounding adoption and children's well-being are valid, but they are being fueled by misinformation. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as those raised by heterosexual parents. Additionally, many communities have successfully integrated same-sex families, and schools have implemented inclusive policies to support these families.\n\nThe federal government should take a proactive approach to address this issue by making same-sex marriage legal in all states. The current amendment restricting marriage to heterosexual couples is not only unjust but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"Under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome argue that gay people are psychologically damaged or born with a \"defect.\" However, this notion is debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association. It is essential to listen to evidence-based research rather than relying on personal opinions and cultural norms.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more inclusive and just society. It is time for the government to take a stand and ensure that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits and protections as everyone else.",
            "In my experience working at a hospital pharmacy, I've gained a unique perspective on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and societal perceptions. While certain substances are prohibited due to their illicit nature, it's essential to acknowledge their potential benefits. In my opinion, making such substances available to the public without proper regulation would be unwise. However, I firmly believe that their medicinal properties warrant consideration for controlled medical use. The fact that a substance is prohibited doesn't inherently negate its potential advantages.\n\nInterestingly, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are commonly used in pharmacies due to their therapeutic value. These substances are subject to strict regulations, but their benefits cannot be denied. If we can accept the legitimacy of these controlled substances, it's equally important to reevaluate the stigma surrounding marijuana. By recognizing its potential benefits, we can work towards a more informed and nuanced understanding of its use.\n\nOne key difference between marijuana and other substances like alcohol lies in their potential for abuse. While excessive use of either substance can lead to negative consequences, it's crucial to acknowledge the distinct risks associated with each. A gradual introduction of marijuana into the mainstream, accompanied by education and regulation, could potentially mitigate abuse and promote responsible use.\n\nThe widespread negative image surrounding marijuana is largely due to its illicit status. However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction and address the misconceptions surrounding this substance. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively low. By dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding marijuana, we can foster a more responsible and informed approach to its use.",
            "The Catholic Church has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the changing times, embracing a more modern and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the strict traditions of the past, replaced by a more casual and inclusive environment. My personal experiences attending church services have shown a notable shift in the way people dress and interact with one another. What used to be a formal affair has given way to a more laid-back atmosphere, especially during the summer months when people often attend in casual beachwear.\n\nThis change is evident not only in the dress code but also in the overall tone of the services. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it more accessible to those with busy schedules, allowing them to participate in their faith without feeling obligated to adhere to a strict time commitment. The presence of families and children has also become more prominent, which is a positive development in creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nWhile I am not well-versed in the inner workings of the church's politics, I can speak to the issue of clergy misconduct. In my opinion, the recent scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church are a complex issue with deep-seated causes. I do not believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining female priests would have been a solution to this problem. Research suggests that pedophilia is a pre-existing condition, often linked to genetic factors, rather than a result of environmental influences. While marriage may provide a sense of fulfillment and stability for some individuals, it is unlikely to alter their inherent tendencies.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that clergy misconduct is not exclusive to the Catholic Church, and it is not solely the result of their celibacy or lack thereof. Rather, it is a symptom of a broader societal issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. If the church or any institution is aware of such misconduct and attempts to cover it up, it is indeed shameful. However, I do not believe that the root cause of this issue lies in the church's policies regarding marriage or ordination.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church has made strides in adapting to the modern world, the issue of clergy misconduct is a more complex and deeply ingrained problem that cannot be simply resolved by altering its practices. Ultimately, it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.",
            "The Iraq war has left a lasting impression on me, and while I initially supported the premise of military action, I have serious concerns about the motivations behind it. Following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration hastily linked Iraq to the terrorist threat, asserting the existence of weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been thoroughly discredited. This deliberate misrepresentation of facts has been a source of great frustration for me.\n\nThe administration's propensity for deception is particularly disturbing, especially given the dire consequences. Colin Powell's subsequent admission that he was unconvinced by the evidence he presented to the UN highlights the scope of this issue. I believe that such deliberate falsehoods are a serious breach of the public's trust and an impeachable offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution has been alarming, particularly in its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th. It is clear that their intention from the outset was to pursue a war in Iraq.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, including a former treasury secretary, George W. Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein may have been driven in part by a desire to expand the country's energy supply. This underhanded motive has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region.\n\nWhile it is true that a sudden withdrawal from Iraq could lead to civil war and further bloodshed, I believe that the current situation has dragged on for far too long. The proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, may not be the most effective or sustainable approach. Iraq's sovereignty will likely remain a contentious issue, and the current interim government's ineffectiveness has exacerbated the problem.\n\nNews reports indicate that the Iraqi Parliament is struggling to assert its authority, and the Prime Minister's influence is being undermined by radical factions vying for control. This fractious environment has hindered the country's development and is an obstacle to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the complexities of the Iraq situation are multifaceted and far-reaching. While I can't articulate a clear-cut solution, I firmly believe that the current path is unsustainable, and a more constructive approach is needed to address the ongoing conflict.",
            "One of the most contentious issues of our time is the War in Iraq. I'm not quite sure where to begin, but I'll try to provide some insight into my perspective.\n\nInitially, I felt that the war was somewhat pointless, given that it wasn't officially declared. It seemed to me that the primary motivation was to retaliate against the country perceived to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Consequently, I didn't closely follow the developments of the war.\n\nHowever, I've come to understand that our presence in Iraq is largely aimed at establishing democracy and securing oil resources. While this may not be the most compelling reason to continue the war, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities involved. On one hand, staying in Iraq would allow us to create a stable democracy, albeit a lengthy and challenging process. On the other hand, our prolonged presence could be seen as an attempt to mold Iraq into a replica of the United States, potentially exacerbating the situation.\n\nMoreover, the war has significant humanitarian consequences, including the displacement of children from their families and the disruption of education. It's essential to consider the impact of our actions on the Iraqi people and the potential for the Al-Qaeda insurgency to grow stronger due to our intervention.\n\nI've come to realize that this conflict is not as black-and-white as it seems. As a nation, we must weigh the pros and cons of our involvement and consider the long-term effects on both the Iraqis and ourselves. In my opinion, the war has the potential to become a long and arduous process, with uncertain outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lack of congressional declaration has raised questions about the legitimacy of the war. As a nation, we should strive to operate within the bounds of our democratic institutions and respect the principles of our government.\n\nUltimately, the decision to continue or withdraw from Iraq is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. While I'm not an expert on the topic, I believe that our actions should be guided by empathy for the Iraqi people and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.",
            "There is a strong argument to be made that government involvement in matters of religious beliefs can be problematic. The constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state suggests that it is not the role of the government to dictate what is or is not acceptable within religious institutions. This separation has been a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to practice their faith without fear of government interference.\n\nThe idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices could be seen as contradictory to the principles enshrined in the constitution. Such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, undermining the very foundation of our democratic system. Furthermore, the motivations behind such a move would need to be carefully examined, particularly if they are driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nIn the context of the proposed amendment, it is essential to consider the potential impact on society. While the economic implications are unclear, it is possible that recognizing and respecting individual freedoms of faith could have a positive effect on the social fabric of our nation. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed should be left to the churches and their respective congregations, rather than being dictated by government edict.\n\nThe notion that the federal government or any public official should impose their will on matters of faith is concerning, especially when it appears to be driven by personal biases rather than a desire to serve the greater good. By respecting the separation of church and state, we can promote a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there may be valid concerns, it is essential to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal agendas to drive policy decisions.",
            "The Iraq War has left a profound impact on the world, sparking intense debates and raising questions about the motivations behind the conflict. In my opinion, the government's initial justification for the invasion was not entirely transparent to the American people. The administration's attempt to link the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and it played on the public's emotions to garner support for the war.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was critical of the invasion from the start. The war in Iraq shares eerie similarities with the Vietnam War, where the government underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges of implementing democracy in a foreign country. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was a significant challenge, and the US government was not adequately prepared for the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe consequences of the war have been dire, with countless American lives lost and ongoing efforts to train the Iraqi military and police forces. The US government's assumption that the invasion would be a swift and successful endeavor was overly optimistic, given the historical precedents of similar conflicts.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is clear that the government's decision-making process was flawed. The Bush administration's claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false, raises concerns about the government's honesty and thoroughness in its decision-making. Furthermore, the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not the target of similar military actions, suggests a potential motive driven by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to spread democracy.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Iraq has raised difficult questions about the morality of military intervention and the true motivations behind it. While it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility towards the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly as a result of the invasion, the human cost of the war cannot be ignored. As the war enters its second decade, it is essential to re-examine the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nThe Iraq War has also sparked discussions about the role of oil and resources in international relations. The fact that Iraq is a significant oil producer and the US government's stated reason for the invasion was to spread democracy and remove a \"rogue\" regime, while conveniently overlooking other countries with similar characteristics, raises suspicions about the true motives behind the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict continues, I can only hope that a peaceful resolution is reached, and the Iraqi people can finally find stability and security. However, the path forward is uncertain, and it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges involved in creating a democratic government in a country ravaged by war.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage has been unwavering throughout my life. I firmly believe that an individual's sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and it should not be subject to societal or governmental restrictions. Recent scientific research has shed light on the biological factors contributing to an individual's sexual orientation, suggesting that it may not be entirely a matter of upbringing or social conditioning.\n\nIn my opinion, it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something that is largely beyond their control. I strongly advocate for the rights of same-sex couples to be recognized and respected.\n\nThe issue here is not about politics or government intervention, but rather about allowing individuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. I have witnessed firsthand the normalcy of same-sex relationships in my community, where gay couples live and interact with their neighbors just like any other family unit. It's time for our society to acknowledge and accept this reality.\n\nThe concept of marriage should be private and personal, not subject to public scrutiny or governmental regulations. If a heterosexual couple can choose to get married without drawing attention to themselves, why should the same not be true for same-sex couples? It's a matter of equality and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nWhile some may argue that marriage is a social construct, I believe that it is a fundamental human right that should be accessible to all, regardless of one's sexual orientation. By recognizing this, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One of the challenges of online communication is that once you share something on the internet, it becomes a matter of public record. As someone who has experience in a residential advisor role, I've seen firsthand how this can be a concern. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and in some cases, it can have serious consequences.\n\nFor instance, if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, it's likely to attract attention from others. Someone might report it to the authorities or school administrators, who then have to take action. This is because the internet is a publicly accessible space, and any content you post can be seen by a wide audience.\n\nI recall an incident at my school where a student made a comment that was misinterpreted as a threat. An overheard conversation was reported to the authorities, and after investigating, it was discovered that the student had posted something online that was meant as a joke. However, in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe key point to remember is that once you post something online, you're giving up a level of control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want people to know something about you, it's best not to post it online. You can't dictate how others will react to what you share, and you can't force them to take it lightly.\n\nWhile I don't think it's appropriate for school officials to be friends with students on social media or monitoring their online activity without consent, if a concern is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take action. This is especially true if there's a potential threat to safety.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, I believe it's best for educators to maintain a professional distance from their students online. As an R.A., I don't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to intrude on their personal lives or be privy to information that might create a conflict of interest. By keeping a professional boundary, I can focus on supporting their academic and personal growth without compromising our relationship.",
            "The ongoing conflict has become excessively prolonged, deviating from its original intent. Initially, the objective was to establish democracy in a country plagued by an unfair political system, a goal that warrants consideration. However, over time, the mission seems to have lost its focus, and the driving force behind it appears to have shifted from promoting democracy to showcasing military prowess.\n\nThe motives behind the initial invasion are also suspect, particularly considering the historical tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While an altruistic aim to establish democracy is understandable, it becomes questionable when personal vendettas are involved.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the war made a significant statement, highlighting the determination to intervene. Nonetheless, the prolonged duration, spanning several years, has led to a protracted and increasingly costly endeavor. It is arguable that the purpose has been undermined, and the war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, driven by the desire to maintain a military presence rather than to achieve a decisive victory.\n\nThe financial burden of this conflict is substantial, diverting billions of dollars from domestic priorities such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and healthcare. These domestic issues, such as public roads, education, and healthcare, are pressing concerns that require attention and funding. It is imperative to reassess the allocation of resources, prioritizing the needs of our own citizens over the prolonged engagement in a foreign conflict. Ultimately, the war has become a costly and seemingly futile endeavor, draining our economy and diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.",
            "When considering whether a student's online profile or activity can be monitored to prevent harm, several factors come into play. For instance, social media platforms like Myspace often require users to allow others to access their profiles by accepting them as friends or acquaintances. In doing so, individuals essentially grant permission for those individuals to view their personal information.\n\nThis raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be traced and monitored. While it's impossible to have a single person continuously monitor every student's online presence, it's also not feasible to simply block certain individuals from accessing the internet. Instead, schools might consider implementing guidelines or policies regarding online safety and responsible behavior.\n\nSome argue that schools have a responsibility to protect students from potential harm, particularly if they have reason to believe that a student may be in danger. In this context, monitoring online activity might be justified. However, this raises issues of privacy and potential discrimination. Schools would need to carefully weigh the benefits of monitoring against the potential risks and ensure that any policies are fair and applied consistently.\n\nThe boundaries between personal and public spaces online are increasingly blurred. Platforms like Myspace and Facebook expose users to a wide audience, and individuals may share personal information without fully realizing its accessibility. This can be concerning, especially considering the ease with which strangers can gather information about others online.\n\nA notable example of this vulnerability can be seen in cases where individuals have used social media to gather sensitive information about others. For instance, a recent television program demonstrated how a person was able to gather a stranger's screen name and establish contact through instant messaging. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing personal details online.\n\nMany students, including myself, have Myspace profiles to connect with friends and maintain social relationships. However, this also means that we must navigate the risks associated with online sharing. It's essential to strike a balance between opening ourselves up to others and protecting our personal information.\n\nIn some cases, schools may restrict access to social media platforms, as was the case in my roommate's high school. While this may seem like an overreach, it also raises important questions about the boundaries between school and personal life. I'm not sure whether it's a matter of privacy or authority, but it's certainly a complex issue.\n\nOverall, the intersection of online safety, privacy, and responsibility is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and it's difficult to approach the subject without acknowledging the complex web of opinions surrounding it. As someone who has grappled with the nuances of this issue, I find myself reflecting on the overwhelming consensus that the war was a misguided endeavor. The vast majority of global polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and internationally, suggest that upwards of 75-80% of the population believes the war was a miscalculation.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by a significant portion of the US military personnel currently stationed in Iraq, with around 70% expressing the opinion that the war was a mistake and that withdrawal within the year is the most prudent course of action. The fact that the war has been widely regarded as a disaster from its inception, with no clear path forward for a successful exit, highlights the enormity of the challenge.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this debacle is the profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region with such a distinct cultural identity is a notion that has been repeatedly proven flawed. The previous administration's decision to invade Iraq was based on a simplistic understanding of the local context, which overlooked the complexities of the region.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, any evaluation of the war's justification requires a balanced consideration of the potential consequences. The catastrophic outcome that unfolded was predictable, and it's essential to acknowledge that the war was not a well-thought-out decision.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, it's becoming increasingly clear that there is no compelling argument to justify an extended US presence. The administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal over a year or more may be a step in the right direction, but the fundamental question remains: what is the purpose of our continued involvement? The voices of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for our departure, should be given significant weight in this decision. It's time to listen to their perspective and recognize that they may possess a deeper understanding of their own situation.\n\nUltimately, if we were to ask the Iraqi people whether they want us to leave, and they respond with a resounding \"yes,\" it would provide a clear justification for our exit. This approach would also absolve us of any potential blame for the consequences of our departure. If we were to decide to assist the Iraqi people after we leave, we could at least do so in a position of moral clarity, rather than being seen as occupying forces.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complicated and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our continued involvement is no longer justified. It's time for us to listen to the voices of the Iraqi people and to reevaluate our role in this conflict.",
            "Gender inequality remains a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in certain professional settings. It's not limited to women, as various fields, including the corporate world, fashion, and even parenting, exhibit inherent biases. The \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women face obstacles in advancing to leadership positions, is a notable example. \n\nWhile societal norms have evolved over time, deeply ingrained attitudes persist. Women are often held to a higher standard, with their professional abilities being scrutinized more closely than men's. Conversely, men who choose to stay at home to raise their children face stigma, as people often expect them to be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are passionate about fashion may be perceived as less credible due to traditional stereotypes. This can be overcome by highlighting the qualities and expertise of individuals who defy these expectations. A gradual shift in societal attitudes is underway, with more people accepting women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads. However, promoting this change requires a delicate approach, as forced efforts can lead to resistance.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic factors can also contribute to inequality. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of gender, may face prejudice based on their educational background or communication skills. For instance, a CEO from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged on their ability to articulate their thoughts, rather than their intelligence or business acumen.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that inequality is not limited to gender; various factors, including socioeconomic status and geographical background, can also contribute to prejudice. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the complexities of societal attitudes and the need for gradual change.",
            "There seems to be a shift in the way the law addresses marijuana possession, from treating it as a criminal offense to a more minor infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change is significant, as it spares individuals from the more severe consequences associated with a criminal charge, such as arrest and court appearances. However, the long-term implications of a decriminalized marijuana policy can still be a concern for those who worry about its impact on their future, particularly in the context of employment and other professional opportunities.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of decriminalization is that it can help alleviate the financial burden on local law enforcement and the judicial system. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession can be resource-intensive and costly. By reducing the number of arrests and court appearances, municipalities can redirect these resources to more pressing community needs, such as public education, social programs, and support services for vulnerable populations.\n\nDenver's approach to marijuana decriminalization is a notable example of this strategy. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana possession, the city has been able to free up resources for more constructive purposes. This is particularly relevant in areas where communities have traditionally been skeptical of marijuana use.\n\nWhile there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of widespread marijuana use, such as increased accidents and public health issues, it's essential to consider the complexities of individual reactions to the substance. People's responses to marijuana can vary greatly, and some may be more susceptible to its effects than others. Moreover, attitudes towards marijuana use are often influenced by cultural and personal factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize marijuana is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks. By considering the financial, social, and individual implications, we can work towards a more informed and evidence-based approach to marijuana policy.",
            "While I acknowledge the importance of tradition in many aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that a balance between preserving heritage and embracing change is crucial. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally essential to adapt to evolving societal norms and values.\n\nOne aspect that has always puzzled me is the perceived disconnect between Catholic doctrine and its application. On one hand, the Church emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, as seen in its teachings on tolerance and compassion. On the other hand, certain practices, such as excluding individuals from the community due to their religious background or perceived imperfections, seem to contradict this message.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' situation. As an Episcopalian, my father was not eligible for a Catholic ceremony, despite my mother's Catholic faith and my own upbringing in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's ideals of acceptance and its more rigid practices.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I think it's essential to consider the potential impact on the institution. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could alleviate certain problems, such as pedophilia, I'm not convinced that this would be a solution. The complexities of human behavior are multifaceted, and individuals who engage in such reprehensible actions are likely driven by factors beyond their marital status.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the Catholic Church should strive to reconcile its doctrine with its practices, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all members of the community.",
            "The issue of church and state separation is especially challenging when considering the definition of marriage. Balancing the involvement of the government in this matter can be delicate, as it involves determining the extent to which a personal, deeply held institution should be regulated by the state. The government's role in recognizing and defining marriage is a complex issue that must be approached with sensitivity.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider the distinction between civil unions and marriage. In this context, marriage is seen as a sacrament or a deeply personal commitment between two individuals, rather than a solely governmental concern. This perspective suggests that the government's role should be limited to recognizing and enforcing the legal aspects of a union, rather than imposing its own definition of what constitutes a valid marriage.\n\nIf the primary focus is on the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, then perhaps it would be more practical to view it as a civil union. This approach would allow the government to maintain a neutral stance on the issue, avoiding entanglement in the deeply personal and often contentious aspects of religious belief.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in defining marriage. If the goal is to establish a uniform national standard, it may be more effective to work towards a federal law that addresses the issue, rather than relying on individual state-by-state solutions.\n\nHowever, amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it represents a significant manipulation of the fundamental document. The constitution should be amended only when dealing with matters of grave national importance, and this issue, while significant to some, may not meet that threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the definition of marriage and the government's role in it is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. A more nuanced approach, focusing on the separation of church and state, and recognizing the complexities of the issue, may be more beneficial than imposing a broad, sweeping solution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have navigated the complexities of homosexuality through various perspectives. Having close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of the issue. While I may not personally adhere to the same lifestyle, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding their personal lives.\n\nIn a democratic society, it is essential to respect the autonomy of each state in making decisions that affect its citizens. By decentralizing the decision-making process, we can ensure that each region's values and values-based policies are reflected in their laws. This approach also acknowledges the diverse nature of the country, where different states have different cultural, social, and political landscapes.\n\nMy stance on gay marriage is founded on the principle of equality and individual freedom. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, deserves the same opportunities and rights. The decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to each state, allowing them to align their laws with their unique values and societal norms. This approach promotes inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for diversity.\n\nRegarding the current federal ban on gay marriage, I don't believe it is the president's role to impose a uniform stance across the country. Each state should have the authority to make its own decisions, free from federal interference. This would enable states to adapt to the changing values and needs of their citizens. Moreover, as the president's term is limited, I believe that the decision should be left to the next administration, ensuring a more transparent and democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a decentralized approach to addressing gay marriage, allowing each state to chart its own course. This approach honors the diversity of the country and promotes a more inclusive and respectful society for all individuals.",
            "In reflecting on the issue of school officials monitoring student activity on online platforms like Myspace, I must consider the balance between personal freedom and school safety. On one hand, Myspace is a public forum where users post content for the world to see. If a student shares information on this platform, they should be aware that it may be accessed by not only their peers but also school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety. If monitoring Myspace helps identify potential concerns or issues that could compromise school security, I think it's reasonable for officials to take notice. Even if the content is not posted under the school's name, they may still be able to access it through their own means.\n\nSome might argue that monitoring student online activity is an invasion of privacy. However, I'd like to propose that this perspective is shortsighted. If officials can use this information to prevent harm and create a safer school environment, I don't believe it's an unreasonable intrusion. In fact, I've spoken to a teacher who shared that they perform online monitoring to detect potential issues, such as substance abuse or other illicit activities.\n\nThis is not entirely unlike the lockdown drills we had in my high school, which were implemented in response to concerns about terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to the issue at hand, they demonstrate the school's commitment to ensuring student safety. By monitoring Myspace, officials are essentially taking a similar proactive approach.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in today's digital age, online content can be enduring and far-reaching. A single post or email can resurface years down the line and cause unintended consequences. This reality underscores the importance of responsible online behavior.\n\nUltimately, I believe that school officials have a responsibility to create a safe environment for their students. If monitoring online activity helps them achieve this goal, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of students.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective on the war. Initially, I was convinced that a swift and decisive action was necessary to rectify the situation. However, as I began to consider the potential consequences, I started to question the efficacy of our approach. It became apparent that a more measured and thoughtful strategy was required, taking into account the complexities of the region and the people involved.\n\nUpon reflection, I believe that our actions were motivated by a mix of emotions, including a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency to address the atrocity that had occurred. While I understand the sentiment behind this reaction, I now think that it led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the long-term effects of our intervention.\n\nThe fact that the people in the region are often at odds with one another is a significant factor in the ongoing conflict. It seems that as long as they are preoccupied with internal struggles, they are less likely to pose a threat to us. In this context, I question the value of our presence in the region. Rather than trying to impose our values and customs, we might be better off focusing on our own interests and security.\n\nI also think that we underestimated the cultural and historical context of war in that part of the world. The concept of conflict and violence is deeply ingrained in their society, and it's unrealistic to expect that we can change this overnight. In many ways, their approach to war is shaped by their unique cultural and historical experiences, and it's not necessarily comparable to our own experiences.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were motivated by a desire for revenge and a sense of national pride, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. This led to a hasty and ill-prepared intervention, which ultimately had unintended consequences. We should have taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the local dynamics and the potential outcomes of our actions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we made some progress in the region, I believe that it's time for us to reassess our presence and consider a more measured withdrawal. The reality is that we cannot stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued presence may actually hinder the local population's ability to govern themselves. It's in our best interest to focus on our own security and interests, rather than trying to impose our will on a region that is fundamentally different from our own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces a challenge in retaining its following due to its stance on certain issues.  One reason for this decline may be the Church's reluctance to adapt to changing societal values.  Specifically, its views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have led to a growing divergence between the Church and its adherents.  While the Church's strong stance on these matters is understandable, its views may be seen as outdated by some.\n\nAs a result, individuals who hold different opinions on these issues may feel uneasy about affiliating with the Church.  For instance, those who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage may find it difficult to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, the Church's stance on these issues may deter individuals who value inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Catholic Church's reluctance to ordain female priests and permit priests to marry is another area of contention.  While some may argue that these changes would not have prevented past controversies, it is worth considering whether greater flexibility in these areas could help the Church stay relevant.  After all, many professionals in other fields balance their work and personal lives, and there is no reason why priests should be held to a different standard.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church's stance on these issues may be a major factor in its declining popularity.  By adopting a more inclusive and flexible approach, the Church may be able to reconnect with its followers and attract a new generation of adherents.  However, this would require the Church to re-examine its traditional views and consider the changing values of modern society.",
            "In my opinion, the issue of gay marriage is a complex one. However, I do not believe that individuals have a choice in their sexual orientation. I think it's essential to recognize that people are born with their orientation, and it's not a decision they make consciously.\n\nI also believe that it's unfair to hold someone accountable for their sexual orientation. It's not something they can change, and it's not something they should be judged for. The idea that a couple of the same sex cannot marry while a heterosexual couple can seems discriminatory and unjust.\n\nI think it's essential to separate the issue of gay marriage from the concept of the federal government's involvement. I don't believe that this is a matter of national security or moral obligation, but rather a personal right that individuals should have the freedom to exercise. The government should not interfere with people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal choices and relationships.\n\nIt's crucial to respect people's differences and not judge them based on their orientation. Gay people are not making a choice, and they should not be punished for being who they are. Ultimately, I think the federal government should stay out of this issue, as it's a matter of individual freedom and human rights.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientation is not a choice, and they should be free to live their lives without judgment or persecution.",
            "I firmly believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, not only for the sake of equality but also due to the numerous benefits it would bring to society. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families. However, this notion is inherently flawed, as it disregards the diversity and individuality of relationships.\n\nLike two sides of the same coin, heterosexual and homosexual relationships share many commonalities. They both involve commitment, love, and a deep emotional bond. The notion that homosexual couples are inherently different is unfounded, and the legal recognition of their relationships should not be denied.\n\nOne of the critical issues that arise when discussing same-sex marriage is the lack of recognition of partners in times of need. For instance, if a partner is hospitalized, their loved one may be denied visitation rights due to not being considered a family member. This is not only unfair but also highlights the need for equal treatment under the law.\n\nScientific studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples face the same challenges and have the same level of relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to marry in a church; rather, they seek a legal document that recognizes their commitment to one another.\n\nThe separation of church and state is often cited as a reason for opposing same-sex marriage. However, this argument is misinformed, as the government's role is to provide a legal framework for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By allowing civil unions, but not marriage, the government is perpetuating a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nThe concerns surrounding adoption and children's well-being are valid, but they are being fueled by misinformation. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as those raised by heterosexual parents. Additionally, many communities have successfully integrated same-sex families, and schools have implemented inclusive policies to support these families.\n\nThe federal government should take a proactive approach to address this issue by making same-sex marriage legal in all states. The current amendment restricting marriage to heterosexual couples is not only unjust but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"Under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome argue that gay people are psychologically damaged or born with a \"defect.\" However, this notion is debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association. It is essential to listen to evidence-based research rather than relying on personal opinions and cultural norms.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more inclusive and just society. It is time for the government to take a stand and ensure that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits and protections as everyone else.",
            "In my experience working at a hospital pharmacy, I've gained a unique perspective on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and societal perceptions. While certain substances are prohibited due to their illicit nature, it's essential to acknowledge their potential benefits. In my opinion, making such substances available to the public without proper regulation would be unwise. However, I firmly believe that their medicinal properties warrant consideration for controlled medical use. The fact that a substance is prohibited doesn't inherently negate its potential advantages.\n\nInterestingly, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are commonly used in pharmacies due to their therapeutic value. These substances are subject to strict regulations, but their benefits cannot be denied. If we can accept the legitimacy of these controlled substances, it's equally important to reevaluate the stigma surrounding marijuana. By recognizing its potential benefits, we can work towards a more informed and nuanced understanding of its use.\n\nOne key difference between marijuana and other substances like alcohol lies in their potential for abuse. While excessive use of either substance can lead to negative consequences, it's crucial to acknowledge the distinct risks associated with each. A gradual introduction of marijuana into the mainstream, accompanied by education and regulation, could potentially mitigate abuse and promote responsible use.\n\nThe widespread negative image surrounding marijuana is largely due to its illicit status. However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction and address the misconceptions surrounding this substance. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively low. By dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding marijuana, we can foster a more responsible and informed approach to its use.",
            "The Catholic Church has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the changing times, embracing a more modern and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the strict traditions of the past, replaced by a more casual and inclusive environment. My personal experiences attending church services have shown a notable shift in the way people dress and interact with one another. What used to be a formal affair has given way to a more laid-back atmosphere, especially during the summer months when people often attend in casual beachwear.\n\nThis change is evident not only in the dress code but also in the overall tone of the services. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it more accessible to those with busy schedules, allowing them to participate in their faith without feeling obligated to adhere to a strict time commitment. The presence of families and children has also become more prominent, which is a positive development in creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nWhile I am not well-versed in the inner workings of the church's politics, I can speak to the issue of clergy misconduct. In my opinion, the recent scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church are a complex issue with deep-seated causes. I do not believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining female priests would have been a solution to this problem. Research suggests that pedophilia is a pre-existing condition, often linked to genetic factors, rather than a result of environmental influences. While marriage may provide a sense of fulfillment and stability for some individuals, it is unlikely to alter their inherent tendencies.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that clergy misconduct is not exclusive to the Catholic Church, and it is not solely the result of their celibacy or lack thereof. Rather, it is a symptom of a broader societal issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. If the church or any institution is aware of such misconduct and attempts to cover it up, it is indeed shameful. However, I do not believe that the root cause of this issue lies in the church's policies regarding marriage or ordination.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church has made strides in adapting to the modern world, the issue of clergy misconduct is a more complex and deeply ingrained problem that cannot be simply resolved by altering its practices. Ultimately, it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.",
            "The Iraq war has left a lasting impression on me, and while I initially supported the premise of military action, I have serious concerns about the motivations behind it. Following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration hastily linked Iraq to the terrorist threat, asserting the existence of weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been thoroughly discredited. This deliberate misrepresentation of facts has been a source of great frustration for me.\n\nThe administration's propensity for deception is particularly disturbing, especially given the dire consequences. Colin Powell's subsequent admission that he was unconvinced by the evidence he presented to the UN highlights the scope of this issue. I believe that such deliberate falsehoods are a serious breach of the public's trust and an impeachable offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution has been alarming, particularly in its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th. It is clear that their intention from the outset was to pursue a war in Iraq.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, including a former treasury secretary, George W. Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein may have been driven in part by a desire to expand the country's energy supply. This underhanded motive has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region.\n\nWhile it is true that a sudden withdrawal from Iraq could lead to civil war and further bloodshed, I believe that the current situation has dragged on for far too long. The proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, may not be the most effective or sustainable approach. Iraq's sovereignty will likely remain a contentious issue, and the current interim government's ineffectiveness has exacerbated the problem.\n\nNews reports indicate that the Iraqi Parliament is struggling to assert its authority, and the Prime Minister's influence is being undermined by radical factions vying for control. This fractious environment has hindered the country's development and is an obstacle to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the complexities of the Iraq situation are multifaceted and far-reaching. While I can't articulate a clear-cut solution, I firmly believe that the current path is unsustainable, and a more constructive approach is needed to address the ongoing conflict.",
            "One of the most contentious issues of our time is the War in Iraq. I'm not quite sure where to begin, but I'll try to provide some insight into my perspective.\n\nInitially, I felt that the war was somewhat pointless, given that it wasn't officially declared. It seemed to me that the primary motivation was to retaliate against the country perceived to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Consequently, I didn't closely follow the developments of the war.\n\nHowever, I've come to understand that our presence in Iraq is largely aimed at establishing democracy and securing oil resources. While this may not be the most compelling reason to continue the war, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities involved. On one hand, staying in Iraq would allow us to create a stable democracy, albeit a lengthy and challenging process. On the other hand, our prolonged presence could be seen as an attempt to mold Iraq into a replica of the United States, potentially exacerbating the situation.\n\nMoreover, the war has significant humanitarian consequences, including the displacement of children from their families and the disruption of education. It's essential to consider the impact of our actions on the Iraqi people and the potential for the Al-Qaeda insurgency to grow stronger due to our intervention.\n\nI've come to realize that this conflict is not as black-and-white as it seems. As a nation, we must weigh the pros and cons of our involvement and consider the long-term effects on both the Iraqis and ourselves. In my opinion, the war has the potential to become a long and arduous process, with uncertain outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lack of congressional declaration has raised questions about the legitimacy of the war. As a nation, we should strive to operate within the bounds of our democratic institutions and respect the principles of our government.\n\nUltimately, the decision to continue or withdraw from Iraq is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. While I'm not an expert on the topic, I believe that our actions should be guided by empathy for the Iraqi people and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.",
            "There is a strong argument to be made that government involvement in matters of religious beliefs can be problematic. The constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state suggests that it is not the role of the government to dictate what is or is not acceptable within religious institutions. This separation has been a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to practice their faith without fear of government interference.\n\nThe idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices could be seen as contradictory to the principles enshrined in the constitution. Such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, undermining the very foundation of our democratic system. Furthermore, the motivations behind such a move would need to be carefully examined, particularly if they are driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nIn the context of the proposed amendment, it is essential to consider the potential impact on society. While the economic implications are unclear, it is possible that recognizing and respecting individual freedoms of faith could have a positive effect on the social fabric of our nation. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed should be left to the churches and their respective congregations, rather than being dictated by government edict.\n\nThe notion that the federal government or any public official should impose their will on matters of faith is concerning, especially when it appears to be driven by personal biases rather than a desire to serve the greater good. By respecting the separation of church and state, we can promote a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there may be valid concerns, it is essential to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal agendas to drive policy decisions.",
            "The Iraq War has left a profound impact on the world, sparking intense debates and raising questions about the motivations behind the conflict. In my opinion, the government's initial justification for the invasion was not entirely transparent to the American people. The administration's attempt to link the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and it played on the public's emotions to garner support for the war.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was critical of the invasion from the start. The war in Iraq shares eerie similarities with the Vietnam War, where the government underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges of implementing democracy in a foreign country. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was a significant challenge, and the US government was not adequately prepared for the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe consequences of the war have been dire, with countless American lives lost and ongoing efforts to train the Iraqi military and police forces. The US government's assumption that the invasion would be a swift and successful endeavor was overly optimistic, given the historical precedents of similar conflicts.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is clear that the government's decision-making process was flawed. The Bush administration's claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false, raises concerns about the government's honesty and thoroughness in its decision-making. Furthermore, the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not the target of similar military actions, suggests a potential motive driven by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to spread democracy.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Iraq has raised difficult questions about the morality of military intervention and the true motivations behind it. While it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility towards the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly as a result of the invasion, the human cost of the war cannot be ignored. As the war enters its second decade, it is essential to re-examine the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nThe Iraq War has also sparked discussions about the role of oil and resources in international relations. The fact that Iraq is a significant oil producer and the US government's stated reason for the invasion was to spread democracy and remove a \"rogue\" regime, while conveniently overlooking other countries with similar characteristics, raises suspicions about the true motives behind the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict continues, I can only hope that a peaceful resolution is reached, and the Iraqi people can finally find stability and security. However, the path forward is uncertain, and it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges involved in creating a democratic government in a country ravaged by war.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage has been unwavering throughout my life. I firmly believe that an individual's sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and it should not be subject to societal or governmental restrictions. Recent scientific research has shed light on the biological factors contributing to an individual's sexual orientation, suggesting that it may not be entirely a matter of upbringing or social conditioning.\n\nIn my opinion, it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something that is largely beyond their control. I strongly advocate for the rights of same-sex couples to be recognized and respected.\n\nThe issue here is not about politics or government intervention, but rather about allowing individuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. I have witnessed firsthand the normalcy of same-sex relationships in my community, where gay couples live and interact with their neighbors just like any other family unit. It's time for our society to acknowledge and accept this reality.\n\nThe concept of marriage should be private and personal, not subject to public scrutiny or governmental regulations. If a heterosexual couple can choose to get married without drawing attention to themselves, why should the same not be true for same-sex couples? It's a matter of equality and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nWhile some may argue that marriage is a social construct, I believe that it is a fundamental human right that should be accessible to all, regardless of one's sexual orientation. By recognizing this, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One of the challenges of online communication is that once you share something on the internet, it becomes a matter of public record. As someone who has experience in a residential advisor role, I've seen firsthand how this can be a concern. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and in some cases, it can have serious consequences.\n\nFor instance, if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, it's likely to attract attention from others. Someone might report it to the authorities or school administrators, who then have to take action. This is because the internet is a publicly accessible space, and any content you post can be seen by a wide audience.\n\nI recall an incident at my school where a student made a comment that was misinterpreted as a threat. An overheard conversation was reported to the authorities, and after investigating, it was discovered that the student had posted something online that was meant as a joke. However, in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe key point to remember is that once you post something online, you're giving up a level of control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want people to know something about you, it's best not to post it online. You can't dictate how others will react to what you share, and you can't force them to take it lightly.\n\nWhile I don't think it's appropriate for school officials to be friends with students on social media or monitoring their online activity without consent, if a concern is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take action. This is especially true if there's a potential threat to safety.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, I believe it's best for educators to maintain a professional distance from their students online. As an R.A., I don't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to intrude on their personal lives or be privy to information that might create a conflict of interest. By keeping a professional boundary, I can focus on supporting their academic and personal growth without compromising our relationship.",
            "The ongoing conflict has become excessively prolonged, deviating from its original intent. Initially, the objective was to establish democracy in a country plagued by an unfair political system, a goal that warrants consideration. However, over time, the mission seems to have lost its focus, and the driving force behind it appears to have shifted from promoting democracy to showcasing military prowess.\n\nThe motives behind the initial invasion are also suspect, particularly considering the historical tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While an altruistic aim to establish democracy is understandable, it becomes questionable when personal vendettas are involved.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the war made a significant statement, highlighting the determination to intervene. Nonetheless, the prolonged duration, spanning several years, has led to a protracted and increasingly costly endeavor. It is arguable that the purpose has been undermined, and the war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, driven by the desire to maintain a military presence rather than to achieve a decisive victory.\n\nThe financial burden of this conflict is substantial, diverting billions of dollars from domestic priorities such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and healthcare. These domestic issues, such as public roads, education, and healthcare, are pressing concerns that require attention and funding. It is imperative to reassess the allocation of resources, prioritizing the needs of our own citizens over the prolonged engagement in a foreign conflict. Ultimately, the war has become a costly and seemingly futile endeavor, draining our economy and diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.",
            "When considering whether a student's online profile or activity can be monitored to prevent harm, several factors come into play. For instance, social media platforms like Myspace often require users to allow others to access their profiles by accepting them as friends or acquaintances. In doing so, individuals essentially grant permission for those individuals to view their personal information.\n\nThis raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be traced and monitored. While it's impossible to have a single person continuously monitor every student's online presence, it's also not feasible to simply block certain individuals from accessing the internet. Instead, schools might consider implementing guidelines or policies regarding online safety and responsible behavior.\n\nSome argue that schools have a responsibility to protect students from potential harm, particularly if they have reason to believe that a student may be in danger. In this context, monitoring online activity might be justified. However, this raises issues of privacy and potential discrimination. Schools would need to carefully weigh the benefits of monitoring against the potential risks and ensure that any policies are fair and applied consistently.\n\nThe boundaries between personal and public spaces online are increasingly blurred. Platforms like Myspace and Facebook expose users to a wide audience, and individuals may share personal information without fully realizing its accessibility. This can be concerning, especially considering the ease with which strangers can gather information about others online.\n\nA notable example of this vulnerability can be seen in cases where individuals have used social media to gather sensitive information about others. For instance, a recent television program demonstrated how a person was able to gather a stranger's screen name and establish contact through instant messaging. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing personal details online.\n\nMany students, including myself, have Myspace profiles to connect with friends and maintain social relationships. However, this also means that we must navigate the risks associated with online sharing. It's essential to strike a balance between opening ourselves up to others and protecting our personal information.\n\nIn some cases, schools may restrict access to social media platforms, as was the case in my roommate's high school. While this may seem like an overreach, it also raises important questions about the boundaries between school and personal life. I'm not sure whether it's a matter of privacy or authority, but it's certainly a complex issue.\n\nOverall, the intersection of online safety, privacy, and responsibility is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and it's difficult to approach the subject without acknowledging the complex web of opinions surrounding it. As someone who has grappled with the nuances of this issue, I find myself reflecting on the overwhelming consensus that the war was a misguided endeavor. The vast majority of global polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and internationally, suggest that upwards of 75-80% of the population believes the war was a miscalculation.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by a significant portion of the US military personnel currently stationed in Iraq, with around 70% expressing the opinion that the war was a mistake and that withdrawal within the year is the most prudent course of action. The fact that the war has been widely regarded as a disaster from its inception, with no clear path forward for a successful exit, highlights the enormity of the challenge.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this debacle is the profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region with such a distinct cultural identity is a notion that has been repeatedly proven flawed. The previous administration's decision to invade Iraq was based on a simplistic understanding of the local context, which overlooked the complexities of the region.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, any evaluation of the war's justification requires a balanced consideration of the potential consequences. The catastrophic outcome that unfolded was predictable, and it's essential to acknowledge that the war was not a well-thought-out decision.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, it's becoming increasingly clear that there is no compelling argument to justify an extended US presence. The administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal over a year or more may be a step in the right direction, but the fundamental question remains: what is the purpose of our continued involvement? The voices of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for our departure, should be given significant weight in this decision. It's time to listen to their perspective and recognize that they may possess a deeper understanding of their own situation.\n\nUltimately, if we were to ask the Iraqi people whether they want us to leave, and they respond with a resounding \"yes,\" it would provide a clear justification for our exit. This approach would also absolve us of any potential blame for the consequences of our departure. If we were to decide to assist the Iraqi people after we leave, we could at least do so in a position of moral clarity, rather than being seen as occupying forces.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complicated and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our continued involvement is no longer justified. It's time for us to listen to the voices of the Iraqi people and to reevaluate our role in this conflict.",
            "Gender inequality remains a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in certain professional settings. It's not limited to women, as various fields, including the corporate world, fashion, and even parenting, exhibit inherent biases. The \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women face obstacles in advancing to leadership positions, is a notable example. \n\nWhile societal norms have evolved over time, deeply ingrained attitudes persist. Women are often held to a higher standard, with their professional abilities being scrutinized more closely than men's. Conversely, men who choose to stay at home to raise their children face stigma, as people often expect them to be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are passionate about fashion may be perceived as less credible due to traditional stereotypes. This can be overcome by highlighting the qualities and expertise of individuals who defy these expectations. A gradual shift in societal attitudes is underway, with more people accepting women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads. However, promoting this change requires a delicate approach, as forced efforts can lead to resistance.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic factors can also contribute to inequality. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of gender, may face prejudice based on their educational background or communication skills. For instance, a CEO from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged on their ability to articulate their thoughts, rather than their intelligence or business acumen.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that inequality is not limited to gender; various factors, including socioeconomic status and geographical background, can also contribute to prejudice. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the complexities of societal attitudes and the need for gradual change.",
            "There seems to be a shift in the way the law addresses marijuana possession, from treating it as a criminal offense to a more minor infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change is significant, as it spares individuals from the more severe consequences associated with a criminal charge, such as arrest and court appearances. However, the long-term implications of a decriminalized marijuana policy can still be a concern for those who worry about its impact on their future, particularly in the context of employment and other professional opportunities.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of decriminalization is that it can help alleviate the financial burden on local law enforcement and the judicial system. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession can be resource-intensive and costly. By reducing the number of arrests and court appearances, municipalities can redirect these resources to more pressing community needs, such as public education, social programs, and support services for vulnerable populations.\n\nDenver's approach to marijuana decriminalization is a notable example of this strategy. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana possession, the city has been able to free up resources for more constructive purposes. This is particularly relevant in areas where communities have traditionally been skeptical of marijuana use.\n\nWhile there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of widespread marijuana use, such as increased accidents and public health issues, it's essential to consider the complexities of individual reactions to the substance. People's responses to marijuana can vary greatly, and some may be more susceptible to its effects than others. Moreover, attitudes towards marijuana use are often influenced by cultural and personal factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize marijuana is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks. By considering the financial, social, and individual implications, we can work towards a more informed and evidence-based approach to marijuana policy.",
            "While I acknowledge the importance of tradition in many aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that a balance between preserving heritage and embracing change is crucial. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally essential to adapt to evolving societal norms and values.\n\nOne aspect that has always puzzled me is the perceived disconnect between Catholic doctrine and its application. On one hand, the Church emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, as seen in its teachings on tolerance and compassion. On the other hand, certain practices, such as excluding individuals from the community due to their religious background or perceived imperfections, seem to contradict this message.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' situation. As an Episcopalian, my father was not eligible for a Catholic ceremony, despite my mother's Catholic faith and my own upbringing in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's ideals of acceptance and its more rigid practices.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I think it's essential to consider the potential impact on the institution. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could alleviate certain problems, such as pedophilia, I'm not convinced that this would be a solution. The complexities of human behavior are multifaceted, and individuals who engage in such reprehensible actions are likely driven by factors beyond their marital status.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the Catholic Church should strive to reconcile its doctrine with its practices, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all members of the community.",
            "The issue of church and state separation is especially challenging when considering the definition of marriage. Balancing the involvement of the government in this matter can be delicate, as it involves determining the extent to which a personal, deeply held institution should be regulated by the state. The government's role in recognizing and defining marriage is a complex issue that must be approached with sensitivity.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider the distinction between civil unions and marriage. In this context, marriage is seen as a sacrament or a deeply personal commitment between two individuals, rather than a solely governmental concern. This perspective suggests that the government's role should be limited to recognizing and enforcing the legal aspects of a union, rather than imposing its own definition of what constitutes a valid marriage.\n\nIf the primary focus is on the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, then perhaps it would be more practical to view it as a civil union. This approach would allow the government to maintain a neutral stance on the issue, avoiding entanglement in the deeply personal and often contentious aspects of religious belief.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in defining marriage. If the goal is to establish a uniform national standard, it may be more effective to work towards a federal law that addresses the issue, rather than relying on individual state-by-state solutions.\n\nHowever, amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it represents a significant manipulation of the fundamental document. The constitution should be amended only when dealing with matters of grave national importance, and this issue, while significant to some, may not meet that threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the definition of marriage and the government's role in it is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. A more nuanced approach, focusing on the separation of church and state, and recognizing the complexities of the issue, may be more beneficial than imposing a broad, sweeping solution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have navigated the complexities of homosexuality through various perspectives. Having close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of the issue. While I may not personally adhere to the same lifestyle, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding their personal lives.\n\nIn a democratic society, it is essential to respect the autonomy of each state in making decisions that affect its citizens. By decentralizing the decision-making process, we can ensure that each region's values and values-based policies are reflected in their laws. This approach also acknowledges the diverse nature of the country, where different states have different cultural, social, and political landscapes.\n\nMy stance on gay marriage is founded on the principle of equality and individual freedom. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, deserves the same opportunities and rights. The decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to each state, allowing them to align their laws with their unique values and societal norms. This approach promotes inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for diversity.\n\nRegarding the current federal ban on gay marriage, I don't believe it is the president's role to impose a uniform stance across the country. Each state should have the authority to make its own decisions, free from federal interference. This would enable states to adapt to the changing values and needs of their citizens. Moreover, as the president's term is limited, I believe that the decision should be left to the next administration, ensuring a more transparent and democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a decentralized approach to addressing gay marriage, allowing each state to chart its own course. This approach honors the diversity of the country and promotes a more inclusive and respectful society for all individuals.",
            "In reflecting on the issue of school officials monitoring student activity on online platforms like Myspace, I must consider the balance between personal freedom and school safety. On one hand, Myspace is a public forum where users post content for the world to see. If a student shares information on this platform, they should be aware that it may be accessed by not only their peers but also school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety. If monitoring Myspace helps identify potential concerns or issues that could compromise school security, I think it's reasonable for officials to take notice. Even if the content is not posted under the school's name, they may still be able to access it through their own means.\n\nSome might argue that monitoring student online activity is an invasion of privacy. However, I'd like to propose that this perspective is shortsighted. If officials can use this information to prevent harm and create a safer school environment, I don't believe it's an unreasonable intrusion. In fact, I've spoken to a teacher who shared that they perform online monitoring to detect potential issues, such as substance abuse or other illicit activities.\n\nThis is not entirely unlike the lockdown drills we had in my high school, which were implemented in response to concerns about terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to the issue at hand, they demonstrate the school's commitment to ensuring student safety. By monitoring Myspace, officials are essentially taking a similar proactive approach.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in today's digital age, online content can be enduring and far-reaching. A single post or email can resurface years down the line and cause unintended consequences. This reality underscores the importance of responsible online behavior.\n\nUltimately, I believe that school officials have a responsibility to create a safe environment for their students. If monitoring online activity helps them achieve this goal, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of students.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective on the war. Initially, I was convinced that a swift and decisive action was necessary to rectify the situation. However, as I began to consider the potential consequences, I started to question the efficacy of our approach. It became apparent that a more measured and thoughtful strategy was required, taking into account the complexities of the region and the people involved.\n\nUpon reflection, I believe that our actions were motivated by a mix of emotions, including a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency to address the atrocity that had occurred. While I understand the sentiment behind this reaction, I now think that it led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the long-term effects of our intervention.\n\nThe fact that the people in the region are often at odds with one another is a significant factor in the ongoing conflict. It seems that as long as they are preoccupied with internal struggles, they are less likely to pose a threat to us. In this context, I question the value of our presence in the region. Rather than trying to impose our values and customs, we might be better off focusing on our own interests and security.\n\nI also think that we underestimated the cultural and historical context of war in that part of the world. The concept of conflict and violence is deeply ingrained in their society, and it's unrealistic to expect that we can change this overnight. In many ways, their approach to war is shaped by their unique cultural and historical experiences, and it's not necessarily comparable to our own experiences.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were motivated by a desire for revenge and a sense of national pride, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. This led to a hasty and ill-prepared intervention, which ultimately had unintended consequences. We should have taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the local dynamics and the potential outcomes of our actions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we made some progress in the region, I believe that it's time for us to reassess our presence and consider a more measured withdrawal. The reality is that we cannot stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued presence may actually hinder the local population's ability to govern themselves. It's in our best interest to focus on our own security and interests, rather than trying to impose our will on a region that is fundamentally different from our own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",
            "I would say yes \nBecause \nUm \nA lot of the things they do are very traditional \nLike they’ve done the same things for long periods of time \nAnd \nIt’s good to be rooted in tradition \nBut it’s also important to be adaptable to change \nUm \nI guess \nA lot of Catholics believe they have to go to Church every week \nAnd \nUm \nThey’re very strict on how things are done \nAnd \nSometimes \nI feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don’t follow the doctrine to a tee \nAnd \nUm \nThey don’t accept people who aren’t exactly perfect Catholics \nAnd \nThey also don’t accept people of other religions \nUm \nLike \nFor example \nMy mom was an Episcopalian \nNo \nI’m sorry \nMy dad was an Episcopalian \nMy mom was a Catholic \nAnd they wouldn’t marry my parents in the Catholic Church \nBecause of my dad’s religion \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat’s not really \nLike \nBeing tolerant of other religions \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others \nThat’s a Catholic teaching \nBut \nIt’s hypocritical to say to love others and then to not accept them \nIn a way like that \nSo \nI feel like a lot of Catholic doctrine tells you to do things \nBut then the Catholic practice goes against it \nBecause it’s so outdated \nBut they continue to stick with it anyway \n\nUm \nI don’t think that would necessarily influence it \nI mean \nI personally think that it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry \nBut \nAs \nI don’t think that would necessarily deter them from their \nLike \nPedophilic behavior \nSo \nBecause it’s just a different realm \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably don’t think that that would be an issue  \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who molest children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they had a \nA spouse or not \nBecause it’s a child which is different than a spouse \nSo if you’re going to do something like that \nYou’re probably going to do it whether or not you’re married \nLike \nI don’t think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose things from happening \nI think that would probably happen regardless \n\nNope \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on certain issues in order to prevent a decline in its followers. One of the primary reasons for this decline, as noted by various discussions, is the Church's perceived inflexibility in accepting modern values and perspectives. Specifically, its strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control may be contributing to a growing divide between the Church and its adherents. \n\nWhile the Church's convictions on these matters are understandable, they may seem outdated to some. By adjusting its stance to reflect a more contemporary outlook, the Church may be able to mitigate the loss of its following. Observers have noted that some individuals are beginning to disaffiliate with the Church due to disagreements over these issues, indicating a widening gap between the Church's views and those of its members. \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights may feel uncomfortable within a community that views the practice as morally reprehensible. Similarly, those who advocate for gay marriage may not feel welcome in a Church that does not recognize their union. The Church's stance on these matters can create a sense of dissonance and potentially drive individuals away. \n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is also a point of contention. While it is unclear whether allowing priests to be married or ordaining women as priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have fostered a more accepting environment. The Church's doctrine views priests as married to God, but this does not preclude the possibility of priests having a personal life outside of their faith. Many professionals lead dual lives, balancing their work and personal responsibilities. There is no apparent reason why priests should be held to a different standard. \n\nBy reevaluating its stance on these issues, the Catholic Church may be able to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that aligns with the values of its followers. This, in turn, could help prevent the continued decline in its following and foster a more harmonious relationship between the Church and its adherents.",
            "While I, personally, have not taken a strong stance on the matter, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. The concept of same-sex marriage is a topic that has sparked much debate, and I think it's essential to approach it with an open mind.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that sexual orientation does not seem to be a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it's unfair to hold them responsible for something that is an inherent aspect of who they are.\n\nFrom my perspective, it appears that the government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted. This is not a matter of national security or moral concerns but rather a personal aspect of an individual's life. It's essential to respect people's choices and identities, and the government should not overstep its bounds by imposing its views.\n\nIn my opinion, the government should not dictate how individuals choose to live their lives. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and it's essential to respect that. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or retribution. This includes those who identify as gay or LGBTQ+, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and respect their rights.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is an issue that warrants serious consideration. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions about the nature of homosexual relationships. However, a closer examination reveals that these relationships are not fundamentally different from heterosexual ones. In fact, research suggests that gay couples exhibit similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding gay marriage is the potential impact on the institution of marriage itself. However, this concern is misguided, as gay couples are not seeking to redefine marriage in a religious context, but rather to obtain a legal recognition of their relationship through a civil marriage certificate. This distinction is crucial, as it separates the issue from religious doctrine and focuses on the legal and social implications.\n\nThe notion that gay marriage poses a threat to traditional family values is also an oversimplification. In reality, the structure and roles within gay relationships are diverse and varied, much like those in heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, the argument that gay couples are not suitable parents due to their sexual orientation is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, research suggests that children raised by gay parents are no more likely to experience difficulties than those raised by heterosexual parents.\n\nThe treatment of children of gay parents in schools is a particularly disturbing aspect of this issue. The existence of special schools for children of gay parents in cities like New York highlights the need for greater acceptance and understanding. Rather than stigmatizing these children, we should focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nThe federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. By making gay marriage legal nationwide, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated equally under the law. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only morally reprehensible but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nLastly, it is essential to acknowledge the harm caused by perpetuating myths about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or the result of childhood trauma. By ignoring scientific evidence and instead relying on anecdotal opinions and popular culture, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a matter of human dignity and equality. By recognizing the similarities between gay and heterosexual relationships and promoting a culture of acceptance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
            "One of the key aspects of my experience working in a hospital pharmacy is the nuanced understanding of the relationship between a substance's legal status and its therapeutic value. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a drug does not necessarily negate its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I firmly believe that certain substances should not be accessible to the general public, their controlled use in a medical context is a different matter altogether. The fact that certain substances are restricted in their availability does not preclude their usefulness in a controlled environment. For instance, many pharmaceuticals that are classified as controlled substances, such as oxycodone and Vicodin, are regularly utilized in pharmacies due to their proven therapeutic benefits. This serves as a prime example of how the stigma surrounding a substance can hinder its acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is a complex issue. While it's true that excessive consumption of either substance can lead to negative consequences, I believe that it's crucial to separate the two in this context. The differing levels of social acceptance and regulation surrounding marijuana contribute to its often-misguided reputation. It's essential to reevaluate this stigma and consider the potential benefits of marijuana in a controlled environment.\n\nA more measured approach to addressing the issue of marijuana's illegality might be to first work on changing the public's perception of the substance. By doing so, individuals may be more inclined to use it responsibly, particularly in cases where it could be beneficial for medicinal purposes. I firmly believe that a more informed and open-minded approach to marijuana could lead to its more widespread acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.",
            "Over the past century, I've noticed a shift in the way the church adapts to the changing times. The once traditional Sunday masses have evolved into a more modern and casual setting. Gone are the days of donning elaborate outfits and picture-perfect appearances; today, people attend mass in jeans and khakis, reflecting the relaxed atmosphere that pervades the community. Families with young children often arrive fashionably late, adding to the casual vibe. This transformation has been particularly evident during summer masses, where beachwear is not uncommon.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I recall attending a private school on the weekends, where I would see friends and classmates every Sunday. The church became a hub for socializing and community building, rather than a strictly traditional gathering. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it easier for people to incorporate faith into their busy schedules.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I don't believe that allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented these incidents. While some might argue that marriage or a more inclusive clergy could have mitigated the problem, I firmly believe that the root of the issue lies in the individual's inherent nature. Research suggests that pedophilia may be linked to genetics, rather than environmental factors. This understanding is supported by studies that indicate a strong genetic component to the condition.\n\nIn cases where clergy members have engaged in such behavior, it's essential to acknowledge that their actions are a result of their personal choices and not a result of their marital status or position within the church. If someone with a predisposition to pedophilia were to get married, it's unlikely that their behavior would change. In fact, their actions might remain hidden for a time, only to surface later. Therefore, I don't think that the church's policies on marriage or clergy composition would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone significant changes, its ability to prevent pedophilia is not directly related to its policies on marriage or clergy. Rather, it's essential to address the root causes of such behavior and hold individuals accountable for their actions. If the church is found to have knowingly covered up such incidents, it's unacceptable and deserves condemnation.",
            "While the initial premise may have sparked some initial acceptance, I believe the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks created a complex geopolitical climate that contributed to the US decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration's assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved false, has been a contentious issue that continues to weigh heavily on my conscience. This deception, coupled with the administration's apparent disregard for the truth, has raised serious concerns about the erosion of the US's constitutional framework.\n\nThe revelation that Colin Powell, then-US Secretary of State, expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the UN, underscores the gravity of the situation. The notion that the administration prioritized its agenda over the well-being of the American people is a notion that has left a lasting impression. Furthermore, the perception that the Bush administration sought to circumvent the Constitution, often under the guise of national security, has only served to exacerbate these concerns.\n\nThe notion that the US invaded Iraq with the intention of expanding its energy interests, as alleged by a former high-ranking official, has further fueled my skepticism about the motivations behind the war. The consequences of this decision have been far-reaching, with the country teetering on the brink of chaos and the potential for civil war.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, the proposed solution of a coalition-led intervention, comprising nations from the surrounding region, has its own set of challenges. The risk of undermining Iraq's sovereignty, already a pressing concern, is a significant one. The difficulties in establishing a stable and effective government, as evident from the current state of the Iraqi Parliament, only serve to highlight the complexity of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I remain uncertain about the long-term implications of the invasion, and the continued involvement of the US in Iraq's affairs. While I can appreciate the need for a solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is required to address the multifaceted challenges facing the region.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the nuances of a situation that has garnered significant attention globally. Initially, I had reservations about the conflict, viewing it as a response to the 9/11 attacks rather than a declared war. As I delved deeper, I began to consider the underlying motivations behind the U.S. presence in Iraq. It appears that the primary goal was to establish a democratic government, mirroring the American system, and secure access to Iraqi oil reserves. However, this approach has been met with resistance, and the conflict has become increasingly contentious.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for cultural insensitivity and the risk of imposing Western values on an alien culture. The longer we remain in Iraq, the more we risk exacerbating existing tensions and potentially creating more enemies. The Al-Qaeda issue is a significant factor, as our attempts to impose democracy may be perceived as a form of cultural imperialism, fueling further hatred towards the U.S.\n\nMoreover, the war has had a profound impact on the people of Iraq, leaving many without basic necessities like education and safety. The presence of various factions vying for power has created a complex and volatile environment, making it challenging to establish a stable government. The ongoing conflict raises questions about the effectiveness of our military strategy and the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nWhile it's difficult to provide a clear-cut solution, I believe that a more measured approach is necessary. We must consider the potential consequences of our actions and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the situation. It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of the conflict and the diverse perspectives involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the War in Iraq are shaped by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that a more thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach is necessary to address the complexities of this situation.",
            "The notion that the government should have the authority to declare certain religious practices legal or illegal strikes me as problematic. The concept of separation of church and state, enshrined in the constitution, implies that such decisions should be left to the churches themselves. This separation serves as a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to hold diverse beliefs without fear of persecution.\n\nEfforts to introduce legislation or amendments that could restrict certain religious practices seem counterintuitive, given the principles of the constitution. In fact, such an amendment would be a departure from the fundamental principles of the document. Moreover, it could be argued that such a move would be an unusual instance of government overreach, as it would impose restrictions on the people rather than the government.\n\nThe motivations behind such an amendment are also cause for concern. If the primary driving force is a personal preference for a particular faith, it raises questions about the impartiality of the government in making decisions that affect the religious freedoms of all citizens. By doing so, it could be perceived as favoring one religion over others.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the impact of such an amendment is unclear, but it's possible that it could have unforeseen benefits on society. However, this seems a tenuous argument for restricting religious freedoms.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what practices are acceptable or not should be left to the churches, as they are best equipped to make informed decisions about the values and principles of their respective faiths. The government's role is to ensure that these decisions do not infringe on the rights of others, not to impose its own will on the people.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of US Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and one that I believe was marred by a lack of transparency and foresight on the part of the US government. The administration's narrative linking the 9/11 attacks to Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities was misleading, and it capitalized on the American people's outrage and fear to justify the invasion.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I was particularly concerned about the preemptive strike on Iraq. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam conflict are striking, with both instances involving a foreign government imposing its will on a sovereign nation, often with disastrous consequences. The US government's failure to learn from past mistakes is a troubling aspect of its decision-making process.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been staggering, with countless American lives lost and a protracted occupation that has shown no signs of resolution. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime created a power vacuum, which the US government was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath was marked by chaos, sectarian violence, and a protracted insurgency that has left the Iraqi people traumatized.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that the US government underestimated the complexities of nation-building and the difficulty of establishing a stable democracy in a war-torn country. The experience in Iraq serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of military intervention and the importance of thorough planning and consideration of long-term consequences.\n\nThe war in Iraq also raises questions about the motivations behind US foreign policy. The pursuit of oil and strategic interests has often been cited as a primary driver of US foreign policy, and the Iraq War is no exception. The lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the decision to invade has contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue that involved a range of factors, including politics, economics, and ideology. While it is difficult to predict the future, I hope that the US government will learn from the lessons of Iraq and approach future conflicts with a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to grapple with, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, as I reflect on the war, I am struck by the human cost and the sense of moral obligation that comes with intervening in a foreign country. The question of when to intervene and how to do so in a way that minimizes harm is a critical one that requires careful consideration and a commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the Iraq War serves as a reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of international relations and the importance of critically evaluating the motivations and actions of those in power.",
            "When considering the issue of gay marriage, I firmly believe that it is a matter of personal preference, one that has been increasingly linked to biological factors rather than sociological influences. Research suggests that there may be a genetic component to sexual orientation, which raises questions about the legitimacy of denying rights to individuals based on something that is largely beyond their control.\n\nThe idea that government and politics should play a role in this matter seems not only misguided but also inhumane. Marriage is a deeply personal and private affair, one that should be left to individuals to decide for themselves, without the interference of external entities. I've witnessed firsthand the loving relationships between gay couples in my community, who live and contribute to society just like any other family.\n\nThe notion that certain groups or individuals can dictate the definition of marriage is not only absurd but also an attempt to impose their will on others. In this case, I believe President Bush's stance on the matter is particularly problematic, as it seeks to reinterpret the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda.\n\nStudies have shown that there may be a chemical component to sexual orientation, which is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This suggests that being gay is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of one's identity. In light of this, it's hard to understand why gay couples are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the most striking disparities in this issue is the double standard that exists. When a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so in private, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a public spectacle, with the media and government scrutinizing every aspect of their relationship. This highlights the need for a more private and personal approach to marriage, one that respects the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices.\n\nOverall, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and equality, and that government and politics should not interfere with the rights of individuals to love and commit to one another.",
            "When something is posted online, it becomes public domain, available for anyone to see. As an RA, I've encountered instances where this has become a pressing concern. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information, especially when it comes to discussions about violent or disturbing topics. The internet's vast reach means that even seemingly private conversations can be accessed by a wide audience, including schools and law enforcement.\n\nIn our school, a recent incident highlighted the importance of this issue. A student shared some concerning comments online, which were later reported to the authorities. It's crucial to acknowledge that online statements, no matter how lighthearted they may seem, can be misinterpreted or taken seriously in the wrong context. This can lead to serious consequences, as in the case of the incident mentioned earlier.\n\nThe power dynamics between students and school officials are also worth examining. While it's understandable that students may not want their personal lives monitored, it's also true that school administrators have a responsibility to act on concerns that may indicate potential threats to student safety. However, this should be done in a way that respects student boundaries and doesn't involve unwarranted surveillance.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to strike a balance between free speech and responsibility. As an RA, I believe it's crucial to educate students about the potential consequences of their online actions and to encourage them to think critically about what they share online. This includes being mindful of their online presence and the potential impact it may have on their relationships and reputation.\n\nBy being aware of these complexities, we can work towards creating a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone involved.",
            "It's been a prolonged and seemingly inconclusive conflict, with its original objectives losing clarity over time. Initially, the goal was to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair government. While that objective is commendable, it's possible that personal animosities between key figures, such as the pre-existing tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAs the war has dragged on, it's become increasingly difficult to discern a clear purpose. The initial phases of the conflict, however, did serve as a powerful statement in support of democracy. Unfortunately, the prolonged nature of the war has compromised its original objectives and led to a loss of focus.\n\nOne could argue that the war's continuation stems from a desire to assert global dominance rather than a genuine commitment to promoting democracy. It's worth considering whether the initial motivations were truly altruistic or if they were driven by less noble intentions.\n\nGiven the immense financial and human costs, it's reasonable to question the war's continued relevance. The funds spent on this conflict could be better utilized to address pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. The fact that we're diverting resources away from our own nation's needs and toward a foreign conflict is a pressing concern.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's imperative to reassess our priorities and reevaluate the war's purpose. It's time for a decisive conclusion, allowing the affected nation to assume responsibility for its own governance and for us to redirect our resources toward more pressing domestic challenges.",
            "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences. This can make it challenging to determine who is genuinely interested in connecting with me and who might be seeking to exploit this information.\n\nIn my own case, I try to strike a balance between sharing enough information to connect with friends and keeping certain details private. However, it's difficult to know exactly what information is being shared and with whom, especially when interacting with people I don't know.\n\nA recent news story about someone using social media to gather information about a young girl and manipulate her highlights the potential risks of online interactions. While I wouldn't engage with someone who I didn't know online, I have experienced instances where people I don't recognize have contacted me through instant messaging, which raises concerns about their intentions.\n\nI also recall a situation where my roommate's high school had banned students from using Myspace, which led to a discussion about the school's authority in this matter. While I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, it did raise questions about the school's right to dictate what students can and cannot do online.\n\nThese are some of the thoughts that come to mind when considering the intersection of social media, privacy, and safety.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered widespread international condemnation. While it's natural to approach this topic with a sense of trepidation, considering the numerous polls and surveys that have been conducted on the matter, it's worth examining the broader context in which the war was initiated.\n\nAccording to various polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, a significant majority of the population – roughly 75 to 80% – views the war as a misstep. Within Iraq, a significant portion of the population shares this sentiment, with 80% advocating for a swift withdrawal. Similarly, a substantial number of US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, believe that the war was a misguided decision and that a withdrawal within a year would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe war's outcome has been widely regarded as a disaster, with many arguing that it was already a catastrophe before the US involvement. The attempt to impose democracy on a region with fundamentally different cultural values has been met with skepticism, and the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states appears insurmountable.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam Hussein was a troublesome leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of invasion before embarking on such a significant endeavor. The consequences of invading a country can be far-reaching and devastating, as seen in the case of Iraq.\n\nGiven the overwhelming international and regional support for a swift withdrawal, it's puzzling that the US administration continues to justify extended involvement. While it's understandable that they may be concerned about the potential consequences of a hasty exit, it's difficult to identify a compelling reason to maintain the current status quo.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a more palatable option, but the underlying question remains: why should the US continue to occupy Iraq? The Iraqi people, whom we aim to assist and protect, are clearly signaling that they want us to leave, and it's worth considering their perspective. By heeding their advice, we may be able to avoid further entanglement in a complex and intractable conflict.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to acknowledge the limits of our influence in the Middle East and to recognize that our actions will never be perceived as altruistic. However, by withdrawing from Iraq, we may be able to mitigate the damage and create a more favorable environment for future engagement.",
            "While societal progress has been made, I firmly believe that gender discrimination still persists in the United States. This issue extends beyond women, as it is deeply intertwined with the specific field or workplace in question. For instance, women often face significant challenges in the business world due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even with equal qualifications, they may struggle to advance to leadership positions. This stems from a long-standing societal bias, where men are often seen as the dominant force in the corporate world.\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in upper-management roles, leading to a reluctance to promote them to key positions. Conversely, men in non-traditional professions, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face prejudice due to societal expectations that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance, as some individuals view men in these roles as deviating from traditional norms.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender-based biases are evident. Men who pursue careers in fashion may be dismissed due to preconceived notions about their masculinity or style. This can lead to a lack of credibility, with some individuals questioning whether men in the fashion industry truly understand the needs of their female clients. However, as more men enter the field and share their perspectives, attitudes are beginning to shift.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. Rather than forcing change, it's necessary to create a gradual shift in societal attitudes. This can be achieved by showcasing the accomplishments and contributions of underrepresented groups, without being overly aggressive or pushy.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It's crucial to recognize that individuals can be discriminated against based on various factors, including their background, education, or even their accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged based on their grammar rather than their intelligence or capabilities.\n\nUltimately, overcoming these biases will require a continued effort to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can work towards a more equitable society where individuals are judged on their merits, regardless of their gender, background, or profession.",
            "In my understanding, the move to decriminalize marijuana has effectively downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. This shift has significant implications, particularly in job interviews and future opportunities, where a marijuana charge can have far-reaching consequences. While this decriminalization may alleviate some of the worst ramifications associated with a drug charge, the long-term effects on one's record can persist.\n\nHowever, there is another side to the argument. The costs associated with arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses can be substantial. From law enforcement expenses to court proceedings and public defenders, the financial burden on municipalities can be considerable. In some cases, these costs can be a significant factor in a community's decision-making process, particularly when they are struggling financially.\n\nDenver serves as an interesting example, as its relatively liberal attitude towards marijuana has allowed the city to redirect funds towards more pressing issues, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless. By decriminalizing marijuana, Denver has been able to allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nWhile it's true that complete legalization of marijuana could have its drawbacks, such as increased public consumption and potential coordination with driving, it's also essential to acknowledge the nuances of individual reactions to the substance. Research has shown that people respond differently to marijuana, and some may be more susceptible to its adverse effects than others. Personalities, moderation, and individual circumstances all play a significant role in determining how one interacts with marijuana.\n\nUltimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. It's crucial to recognize that people's experiences with substances are unique, and a more thoughtful approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding marijuana use.",
            "My stance on this issue is yes, albeit with certain reservations. While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships. My own family's experience illustrates this point; my parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in a Catholic ceremony due to their differing faiths.\n\nThis dichotomy between doctrine and practice is a significant issue within the Catholic Church. While the Church's teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and love, its rigid adherence to tradition often undermines these values. This has led me to question the effectiveness of certain Church practices and policies.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marital status, it's essential to separate the potential benefits of allowing priests to marry from the underlying causes of clergy misconduct. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could help prevent certain behaviors, I believe that such actions are often driven by deeper psychological issues. Ultimately, the relationship between marriage and clergy misconduct is complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the value of tradition, I also believe that the Catholic Church must re-examine its practices and policies to ensure they align with its core teachings. By doing so, the Church can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment that truly reflects its values.",
            "The issue at hand is a complex one, and I am still in the process of forming a well-rounded opinion. Both sides of the debate present valid arguments, making it challenging to definitively declare a winner. One of the primary difficulties lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state. The concept of marriage, particularly in its definition, raises questions about the role of government intervention.\n\nWhile many view marriage as a sacrament, others see it as a civil union, which has significant implications for taxation and government recognition. For instance, individuals who have been baptized may receive certain benefits. I believe that the government should consider marriage as a civil union, focusing on the union of two individuals rather than the specifics of the ceremony. This approach avoids entangling church and state, allowing individuals to define their union according to their personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, I believe that the primary concern should be the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, not the label attached to their union. In the event that all states can come to a mutually agreeable decision, a federal law would be a more practical solution than a constitutional amendment. However, altering the constitution to ban gay marriage would be an extreme measure, as it is a relatively minor issue compared to the weight and significance of constitutional amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and its definition requires careful consideration of the separation of church and state, individual rights, and the role of government intervention. A more nuanced approach would prioritize civil unions and the inherent value of all individuals, rather than focusing on specific labels or definitions.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has led me to develop a nuanced perspective on the issue of homosexuality. While I have close friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I don't necessarily align with the entire spectrum of the gay rights movement. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their personal lives, and therefore, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think the decision should be left to the federal government, as this is a matter of state-level politics. Each state has its unique cultural and social dynamics, and it's essential to respect the democratic process. In democratic states, the residents are likely to have already expressed their views on the issue through their elected representatives. Conversely, in more conservative states, the residents have also had a say in the decision-making process.\n\nI believe that individuals should be free to live their lives according to their own values and principles, and as such, they should have the same opportunities and rights as heterosexual individuals. This is why I think it's essential to let each state decide whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal government should not impose its will on the states, as this would undermine the principles of local governance.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced that the President's personal opinion on the matter should dictate the nation's stance. Given the limited time left in President Bush's term, it's likely that the issue will be revisited by future administrations. Rather than creating a national debate, it would be more practical to allow each state to handle the matter according to its own values and priorities.\n\nUltimately, this issue should be left to the discretion of each state, as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision. This approach respects the diversity of the nation and allows for a more inclusive and adaptive response to the complexities of modern society.",
            "When considering the intersection of online privacy and school safety, it's essential to acknowledge that online platforms like Myspace are inherently public spaces. By definition, posting content on such sites makes it accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. \n\nIn the case of a student posting potentially incriminating content online, it's reasonable for school officials to have access to that information, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school's name. The notion that officials can access this information from their personal residences is a reality, and it underscores the need for responsible online behavior among students.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring online activity raises concerns about privacy. While it's understandable that schools may want to ensure a safe environment, overstepping into the realm of monitoring students' personal online lives can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThis is a delicate balance, especially considering the potential consequences of not taking proactive measures to prevent incidents like school shootings. While it's true that school officials may have legitimate reasons for monitoring online activity, it's also essential to respect students' right to online privacy. \n\nIn some cases, school officials may use online monitoring as a means to identify potential issues and prevent them from escalating. For instance, if a student is posting about substance use or other concerning behavior, it's reasonable for officials to take note and address the situation. However, this approach must be carefully managed to avoid crossing the line into excessive monitoring.\n\nWhen discussing this topic with a former teacher, I was reminded of the importance of school safety drills and lockdown procedures. These measures are put in place to ensure the well-being of students in the event of an emergency, such as a school shooting. While the specific incident I'm referring to may seem unrelated, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context of school safety and the measures taken to prevent incidents.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials is to create a safe and supportive environment for students. While online monitoring can be a valuable tool in achieving this goal, it's crucial to strike a balance between safety and privacy. By being mindful of these considerations, we can work towards creating a more effective and responsible approach to school safety.",
            "My initial perspective on the war was shaped by the personal impact of 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation now, I realize that our entry into the conflict was likely premature and misguided. While the emotional response to the tragedy was understandable, it appears that we overlooked several crucial aspects and failed to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nOur forces were sent to the region without adequate preparation, and the nature of war in the target country is vastly different from what we experience. The local culture and methods of warfare are often brutal and driven by a desire for self-preservation, rather than a genuine interest in nation-building.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems that our primary motivation for going to war was a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The decision to invade Iraq was likely influenced by a mix of public sentiment and a perceived need for action following 9/11. While I understand the sentiment behind this decision, I now believe that it was a hasty and misguided one.\n\nLooking back, it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges we would face. A more measured approach, with a clear plan and a deeper understanding of the local culture, would have been more effective in the long run. Unfortunately, our impulsive response led to a situation that has been difficult to extricate ourselves from.\n\nThe reality is that the country we intervened in is unlikely to change its fundamental nature, and our attempts to impose our will on them have been counterproductive. In many ways, our presence has become a catalyst for further division and conflict, rather than a force for stability.\n\nWhile we have made some progress, it's clear that our presence is no longer tenable. The fact is that we can't stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued involvement is only serving to perpetuate a cycle of violence and instability. It's time for us to acknowledge that our intervention has not achieved its intended goals and to begin planning for a responsible exit strategy."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on certain issues in order to prevent a decline in its followers. One of the primary reasons for this decline, as noted by various discussions, is the Church's perceived inflexibility in accepting modern values and perspectives. Specifically, its strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control may be contributing to a growing divide between the Church and its adherents. \n\nWhile the Church's convictions on these matters are understandable, they may seem outdated to some. By adjusting its stance to reflect a more contemporary outlook, the Church may be able to mitigate the loss of its following. Observers have noted that some individuals are beginning to disaffiliate with the Church due to disagreements over these issues, indicating a widening gap between the Church's views and those of its members. \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights may feel uncomfortable within a community that views the practice as morally reprehensible. Similarly, those who advocate for gay marriage may not feel welcome in a Church that does not recognize their union. The Church's stance on these matters can create a sense of dissonance and potentially drive individuals away. \n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is also a point of contention. While it is unclear whether allowing priests to be married or ordaining women as priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have fostered a more accepting environment. The Church's doctrine views priests as married to God, but this does not preclude the possibility of priests having a personal life outside of their faith. Many professionals lead dual lives, balancing their work and personal responsibilities. There is no apparent reason why priests should be held to a different standard. \n\nBy reevaluating its stance on these issues, the Catholic Church may be able to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that aligns with the values of its followers. This, in turn, could help prevent the continued decline in its following and foster a more harmonious relationship between the Church and its adherents.",
            "While I, personally, have not taken a strong stance on the matter, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. The concept of same-sex marriage is a topic that has sparked much debate, and I think it's essential to approach it with an open mind.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that sexual orientation does not seem to be a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it's unfair to hold them responsible for something that is an inherent aspect of who they are.\n\nFrom my perspective, it appears that the government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted. This is not a matter of national security or moral concerns but rather a personal aspect of an individual's life. It's essential to respect people's choices and identities, and the government should not overstep its bounds by imposing its views.\n\nIn my opinion, the government should not dictate how individuals choose to live their lives. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and it's essential to respect that. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or retribution. This includes those who identify as gay or LGBTQ+, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and respect their rights.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is an issue that warrants serious consideration. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions about the nature of homosexual relationships. However, a closer examination reveals that these relationships are not fundamentally different from heterosexual ones. In fact, research suggests that gay couples exhibit similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding gay marriage is the potential impact on the institution of marriage itself. However, this concern is misguided, as gay couples are not seeking to redefine marriage in a religious context, but rather to obtain a legal recognition of their relationship through a civil marriage certificate. This distinction is crucial, as it separates the issue from religious doctrine and focuses on the legal and social implications.\n\nThe notion that gay marriage poses a threat to traditional family values is also an oversimplification. In reality, the structure and roles within gay relationships are diverse and varied, much like those in heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, the argument that gay couples are not suitable parents due to their sexual orientation is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, research suggests that children raised by gay parents are no more likely to experience difficulties than those raised by heterosexual parents.\n\nThe treatment of children of gay parents in schools is a particularly disturbing aspect of this issue. The existence of special schools for children of gay parents in cities like New York highlights the need for greater acceptance and understanding. Rather than stigmatizing these children, we should focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nThe federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. By making gay marriage legal nationwide, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated equally under the law. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only morally reprehensible but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nLastly, it is essential to acknowledge the harm caused by perpetuating myths about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or the result of childhood trauma. By ignoring scientific evidence and instead relying on anecdotal opinions and popular culture, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a matter of human dignity and equality. By recognizing the similarities between gay and heterosexual relationships and promoting a culture of acceptance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
            "One of the key aspects of my experience working in a hospital pharmacy is the nuanced understanding of the relationship between a substance's legal status and its therapeutic value. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a drug does not necessarily negate its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I firmly believe that certain substances should not be accessible to the general public, their controlled use in a medical context is a different matter altogether. The fact that certain substances are restricted in their availability does not preclude their usefulness in a controlled environment. For instance, many pharmaceuticals that are classified as controlled substances, such as oxycodone and Vicodin, are regularly utilized in pharmacies due to their proven therapeutic benefits. This serves as a prime example of how the stigma surrounding a substance can hinder its acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is a complex issue. While it's true that excessive consumption of either substance can lead to negative consequences, I believe that it's crucial to separate the two in this context. The differing levels of social acceptance and regulation surrounding marijuana contribute to its often-misguided reputation. It's essential to reevaluate this stigma and consider the potential benefits of marijuana in a controlled environment.\n\nA more measured approach to addressing the issue of marijuana's illegality might be to first work on changing the public's perception of the substance. By doing so, individuals may be more inclined to use it responsibly, particularly in cases where it could be beneficial for medicinal purposes. I firmly believe that a more informed and open-minded approach to marijuana could lead to its more widespread acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.",
            "Over the past century, I've noticed a shift in the way the church adapts to the changing times. The once traditional Sunday masses have evolved into a more modern and casual setting. Gone are the days of donning elaborate outfits and picture-perfect appearances; today, people attend mass in jeans and khakis, reflecting the relaxed atmosphere that pervades the community. Families with young children often arrive fashionably late, adding to the casual vibe. This transformation has been particularly evident during summer masses, where beachwear is not uncommon.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I recall attending a private school on the weekends, where I would see friends and classmates every Sunday. The church became a hub for socializing and community building, rather than a strictly traditional gathering. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it easier for people to incorporate faith into their busy schedules.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I don't believe that allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented these incidents. While some might argue that marriage or a more inclusive clergy could have mitigated the problem, I firmly believe that the root of the issue lies in the individual's inherent nature. Research suggests that pedophilia may be linked to genetics, rather than environmental factors. This understanding is supported by studies that indicate a strong genetic component to the condition.\n\nIn cases where clergy members have engaged in such behavior, it's essential to acknowledge that their actions are a result of their personal choices and not a result of their marital status or position within the church. If someone with a predisposition to pedophilia were to get married, it's unlikely that their behavior would change. In fact, their actions might remain hidden for a time, only to surface later. Therefore, I don't think that the church's policies on marriage or clergy composition would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone significant changes, its ability to prevent pedophilia is not directly related to its policies on marriage or clergy. Rather, it's essential to address the root causes of such behavior and hold individuals accountable for their actions. If the church is found to have knowingly covered up such incidents, it's unacceptable and deserves condemnation.",
            "While the initial premise may have sparked some initial acceptance, I believe the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks created a complex geopolitical climate that contributed to the US decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration's assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved false, has been a contentious issue that continues to weigh heavily on my conscience. This deception, coupled with the administration's apparent disregard for the truth, has raised serious concerns about the erosion of the US's constitutional framework.\n\nThe revelation that Colin Powell, then-US Secretary of State, expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the UN, underscores the gravity of the situation. The notion that the administration prioritized its agenda over the well-being of the American people is a notion that has left a lasting impression. Furthermore, the perception that the Bush administration sought to circumvent the Constitution, often under the guise of national security, has only served to exacerbate these concerns.\n\nThe notion that the US invaded Iraq with the intention of expanding its energy interests, as alleged by a former high-ranking official, has further fueled my skepticism about the motivations behind the war. The consequences of this decision have been far-reaching, with the country teetering on the brink of chaos and the potential for civil war.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, the proposed solution of a coalition-led intervention, comprising nations from the surrounding region, has its own set of challenges. The risk of undermining Iraq's sovereignty, already a pressing concern, is a significant one. The difficulties in establishing a stable and effective government, as evident from the current state of the Iraqi Parliament, only serve to highlight the complexity of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I remain uncertain about the long-term implications of the invasion, and the continued involvement of the US in Iraq's affairs. While I can appreciate the need for a solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is required to address the multifaceted challenges facing the region.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the nuances of a situation that has garnered significant attention globally. Initially, I had reservations about the conflict, viewing it as a response to the 9/11 attacks rather than a declared war. As I delved deeper, I began to consider the underlying motivations behind the U.S. presence in Iraq. It appears that the primary goal was to establish a democratic government, mirroring the American system, and secure access to Iraqi oil reserves. However, this approach has been met with resistance, and the conflict has become increasingly contentious.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for cultural insensitivity and the risk of imposing Western values on an alien culture. The longer we remain in Iraq, the more we risk exacerbating existing tensions and potentially creating more enemies. The Al-Qaeda issue is a significant factor, as our attempts to impose democracy may be perceived as a form of cultural imperialism, fueling further hatred towards the U.S.\n\nMoreover, the war has had a profound impact on the people of Iraq, leaving many without basic necessities like education and safety. The presence of various factions vying for power has created a complex and volatile environment, making it challenging to establish a stable government. The ongoing conflict raises questions about the effectiveness of our military strategy and the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nWhile it's difficult to provide a clear-cut solution, I believe that a more measured approach is necessary. We must consider the potential consequences of our actions and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the situation. It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of the conflict and the diverse perspectives involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the War in Iraq are shaped by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that a more thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach is necessary to address the complexities of this situation.",
            "The notion that the government should have the authority to declare certain religious practices legal or illegal strikes me as problematic. The concept of separation of church and state, enshrined in the constitution, implies that such decisions should be left to the churches themselves. This separation serves as a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to hold diverse beliefs without fear of persecution.\n\nEfforts to introduce legislation or amendments that could restrict certain religious practices seem counterintuitive, given the principles of the constitution. In fact, such an amendment would be a departure from the fundamental principles of the document. Moreover, it could be argued that such a move would be an unusual instance of government overreach, as it would impose restrictions on the people rather than the government.\n\nThe motivations behind such an amendment are also cause for concern. If the primary driving force is a personal preference for a particular faith, it raises questions about the impartiality of the government in making decisions that affect the religious freedoms of all citizens. By doing so, it could be perceived as favoring one religion over others.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the impact of such an amendment is unclear, but it's possible that it could have unforeseen benefits on society. However, this seems a tenuous argument for restricting religious freedoms.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what practices are acceptable or not should be left to the churches, as they are best equipped to make informed decisions about the values and principles of their respective faiths. The government's role is to ensure that these decisions do not infringe on the rights of others, not to impose its own will on the people.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of US Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and one that I believe was marred by a lack of transparency and foresight on the part of the US government. The administration's narrative linking the 9/11 attacks to Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities was misleading, and it capitalized on the American people's outrage and fear to justify the invasion.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I was particularly concerned about the preemptive strike on Iraq. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam conflict are striking, with both instances involving a foreign government imposing its will on a sovereign nation, often with disastrous consequences. The US government's failure to learn from past mistakes is a troubling aspect of its decision-making process.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been staggering, with countless American lives lost and a protracted occupation that has shown no signs of resolution. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime created a power vacuum, which the US government was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath was marked by chaos, sectarian violence, and a protracted insurgency that has left the Iraqi people traumatized.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that the US government underestimated the complexities of nation-building and the difficulty of establishing a stable democracy in a war-torn country. The experience in Iraq serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of military intervention and the importance of thorough planning and consideration of long-term consequences.\n\nThe war in Iraq also raises questions about the motivations behind US foreign policy. The pursuit of oil and strategic interests has often been cited as a primary driver of US foreign policy, and the Iraq War is no exception. The lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the decision to invade has contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue that involved a range of factors, including politics, economics, and ideology. While it is difficult to predict the future, I hope that the US government will learn from the lessons of Iraq and approach future conflicts with a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to grapple with, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, as I reflect on the war, I am struck by the human cost and the sense of moral obligation that comes with intervening in a foreign country. The question of when to intervene and how to do so in a way that minimizes harm is a critical one that requires careful consideration and a commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the Iraq War serves as a reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of international relations and the importance of critically evaluating the motivations and actions of those in power.",
            "When considering the issue of gay marriage, I firmly believe that it is a matter of personal preference, one that has been increasingly linked to biological factors rather than sociological influences. Research suggests that there may be a genetic component to sexual orientation, which raises questions about the legitimacy of denying rights to individuals based on something that is largely beyond their control.\n\nThe idea that government and politics should play a role in this matter seems not only misguided but also inhumane. Marriage is a deeply personal and private affair, one that should be left to individuals to decide for themselves, without the interference of external entities. I've witnessed firsthand the loving relationships between gay couples in my community, who live and contribute to society just like any other family.\n\nThe notion that certain groups or individuals can dictate the definition of marriage is not only absurd but also an attempt to impose their will on others. In this case, I believe President Bush's stance on the matter is particularly problematic, as it seeks to reinterpret the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda.\n\nStudies have shown that there may be a chemical component to sexual orientation, which is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This suggests that being gay is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of one's identity. In light of this, it's hard to understand why gay couples are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the most striking disparities in this issue is the double standard that exists. When a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so in private, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a public spectacle, with the media and government scrutinizing every aspect of their relationship. This highlights the need for a more private and personal approach to marriage, one that respects the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices.\n\nOverall, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and equality, and that government and politics should not interfere with the rights of individuals to love and commit to one another.",
            "When something is posted online, it becomes public domain, available for anyone to see. As an RA, I've encountered instances where this has become a pressing concern. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information, especially when it comes to discussions about violent or disturbing topics. The internet's vast reach means that even seemingly private conversations can be accessed by a wide audience, including schools and law enforcement.\n\nIn our school, a recent incident highlighted the importance of this issue. A student shared some concerning comments online, which were later reported to the authorities. It's crucial to acknowledge that online statements, no matter how lighthearted they may seem, can be misinterpreted or taken seriously in the wrong context. This can lead to serious consequences, as in the case of the incident mentioned earlier.\n\nThe power dynamics between students and school officials are also worth examining. While it's understandable that students may not want their personal lives monitored, it's also true that school administrators have a responsibility to act on concerns that may indicate potential threats to student safety. However, this should be done in a way that respects student boundaries and doesn't involve unwarranted surveillance.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to strike a balance between free speech and responsibility. As an RA, I believe it's crucial to educate students about the potential consequences of their online actions and to encourage them to think critically about what they share online. This includes being mindful of their online presence and the potential impact it may have on their relationships and reputation.\n\nBy being aware of these complexities, we can work towards creating a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone involved.",
            "It's been a prolonged and seemingly inconclusive conflict, with its original objectives losing clarity over time. Initially, the goal was to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair government. While that objective is commendable, it's possible that personal animosities between key figures, such as the pre-existing tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAs the war has dragged on, it's become increasingly difficult to discern a clear purpose. The initial phases of the conflict, however, did serve as a powerful statement in support of democracy. Unfortunately, the prolonged nature of the war has compromised its original objectives and led to a loss of focus.\n\nOne could argue that the war's continuation stems from a desire to assert global dominance rather than a genuine commitment to promoting democracy. It's worth considering whether the initial motivations were truly altruistic or if they were driven by less noble intentions.\n\nGiven the immense financial and human costs, it's reasonable to question the war's continued relevance. The funds spent on this conflict could be better utilized to address pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. The fact that we're diverting resources away from our own nation's needs and toward a foreign conflict is a pressing concern.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's imperative to reassess our priorities and reevaluate the war's purpose. It's time for a decisive conclusion, allowing the affected nation to assume responsibility for its own governance and for us to redirect our resources toward more pressing domestic challenges.",
            "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences. This can make it challenging to determine who is genuinely interested in connecting with me and who might be seeking to exploit this information.\n\nIn my own case, I try to strike a balance between sharing enough information to connect with friends and keeping certain details private. However, it's difficult to know exactly what information is being shared and with whom, especially when interacting with people I don't know.\n\nA recent news story about someone using social media to gather information about a young girl and manipulate her highlights the potential risks of online interactions. While I wouldn't engage with someone who I didn't know online, I have experienced instances where people I don't recognize have contacted me through instant messaging, which raises concerns about their intentions.\n\nI also recall a situation where my roommate's high school had banned students from using Myspace, which led to a discussion about the school's authority in this matter. While I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, it did raise questions about the school's right to dictate what students can and cannot do online.\n\nThese are some of the thoughts that come to mind when considering the intersection of social media, privacy, and safety.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered widespread international condemnation. While it's natural to approach this topic with a sense of trepidation, considering the numerous polls and surveys that have been conducted on the matter, it's worth examining the broader context in which the war was initiated.\n\nAccording to various polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, a significant majority of the population – roughly 75 to 80% – views the war as a misstep. Within Iraq, a significant portion of the population shares this sentiment, with 80% advocating for a swift withdrawal. Similarly, a substantial number of US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, believe that the war was a misguided decision and that a withdrawal within a year would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe war's outcome has been widely regarded as a disaster, with many arguing that it was already a catastrophe before the US involvement. The attempt to impose democracy on a region with fundamentally different cultural values has been met with skepticism, and the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states appears insurmountable.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam Hussein was a troublesome leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of invasion before embarking on such a significant endeavor. The consequences of invading a country can be far-reaching and devastating, as seen in the case of Iraq.\n\nGiven the overwhelming international and regional support for a swift withdrawal, it's puzzling that the US administration continues to justify extended involvement. While it's understandable that they may be concerned about the potential consequences of a hasty exit, it's difficult to identify a compelling reason to maintain the current status quo.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a more palatable option, but the underlying question remains: why should the US continue to occupy Iraq? The Iraqi people, whom we aim to assist and protect, are clearly signaling that they want us to leave, and it's worth considering their perspective. By heeding their advice, we may be able to avoid further entanglement in a complex and intractable conflict.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to acknowledge the limits of our influence in the Middle East and to recognize that our actions will never be perceived as altruistic. However, by withdrawing from Iraq, we may be able to mitigate the damage and create a more favorable environment for future engagement.",
            "While societal progress has been made, I firmly believe that gender discrimination still persists in the United States. This issue extends beyond women, as it is deeply intertwined with the specific field or workplace in question. For instance, women often face significant challenges in the business world due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even with equal qualifications, they may struggle to advance to leadership positions. This stems from a long-standing societal bias, where men are often seen as the dominant force in the corporate world.\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in upper-management roles, leading to a reluctance to promote them to key positions. Conversely, men in non-traditional professions, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face prejudice due to societal expectations that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance, as some individuals view men in these roles as deviating from traditional norms.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender-based biases are evident. Men who pursue careers in fashion may be dismissed due to preconceived notions about their masculinity or style. This can lead to a lack of credibility, with some individuals questioning whether men in the fashion industry truly understand the needs of their female clients. However, as more men enter the field and share their perspectives, attitudes are beginning to shift.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. Rather than forcing change, it's necessary to create a gradual shift in societal attitudes. This can be achieved by showcasing the accomplishments and contributions of underrepresented groups, without being overly aggressive or pushy.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It's crucial to recognize that individuals can be discriminated against based on various factors, including their background, education, or even their accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged based on their grammar rather than their intelligence or capabilities.\n\nUltimately, overcoming these biases will require a continued effort to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can work towards a more equitable society where individuals are judged on their merits, regardless of their gender, background, or profession.",
            "In my understanding, the move to decriminalize marijuana has effectively downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. This shift has significant implications, particularly in job interviews and future opportunities, where a marijuana charge can have far-reaching consequences. While this decriminalization may alleviate some of the worst ramifications associated with a drug charge, the long-term effects on one's record can persist.\n\nHowever, there is another side to the argument. The costs associated with arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses can be substantial. From law enforcement expenses to court proceedings and public defenders, the financial burden on municipalities can be considerable. In some cases, these costs can be a significant factor in a community's decision-making process, particularly when they are struggling financially.\n\nDenver serves as an interesting example, as its relatively liberal attitude towards marijuana has allowed the city to redirect funds towards more pressing issues, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless. By decriminalizing marijuana, Denver has been able to allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nWhile it's true that complete legalization of marijuana could have its drawbacks, such as increased public consumption and potential coordination with driving, it's also essential to acknowledge the nuances of individual reactions to the substance. Research has shown that people respond differently to marijuana, and some may be more susceptible to its adverse effects than others. Personalities, moderation, and individual circumstances all play a significant role in determining how one interacts with marijuana.\n\nUltimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. It's crucial to recognize that people's experiences with substances are unique, and a more thoughtful approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding marijuana use.",
            "My stance on this issue is yes, albeit with certain reservations. While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships. My own family's experience illustrates this point; my parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in a Catholic ceremony due to their differing faiths.\n\nThis dichotomy between doctrine and practice is a significant issue within the Catholic Church. While the Church's teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and love, its rigid adherence to tradition often undermines these values. This has led me to question the effectiveness of certain Church practices and policies.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marital status, it's essential to separate the potential benefits of allowing priests to marry from the underlying causes of clergy misconduct. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could help prevent certain behaviors, I believe that such actions are often driven by deeper psychological issues. Ultimately, the relationship between marriage and clergy misconduct is complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the value of tradition, I also believe that the Catholic Church must re-examine its practices and policies to ensure they align with its core teachings. By doing so, the Church can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment that truly reflects its values.",
            "The issue at hand is a complex one, and I am still in the process of forming a well-rounded opinion. Both sides of the debate present valid arguments, making it challenging to definitively declare a winner. One of the primary difficulties lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state. The concept of marriage, particularly in its definition, raises questions about the role of government intervention.\n\nWhile many view marriage as a sacrament, others see it as a civil union, which has significant implications for taxation and government recognition. For instance, individuals who have been baptized may receive certain benefits. I believe that the government should consider marriage as a civil union, focusing on the union of two individuals rather than the specifics of the ceremony. This approach avoids entangling church and state, allowing individuals to define their union according to their personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, I believe that the primary concern should be the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, not the label attached to their union. In the event that all states can come to a mutually agreeable decision, a federal law would be a more practical solution than a constitutional amendment. However, altering the constitution to ban gay marriage would be an extreme measure, as it is a relatively minor issue compared to the weight and significance of constitutional amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and its definition requires careful consideration of the separation of church and state, individual rights, and the role of government intervention. A more nuanced approach would prioritize civil unions and the inherent value of all individuals, rather than focusing on specific labels or definitions.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has led me to develop a nuanced perspective on the issue of homosexuality. While I have close friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I don't necessarily align with the entire spectrum of the gay rights movement. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their personal lives, and therefore, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think the decision should be left to the federal government, as this is a matter of state-level politics. Each state has its unique cultural and social dynamics, and it's essential to respect the democratic process. In democratic states, the residents are likely to have already expressed their views on the issue through their elected representatives. Conversely, in more conservative states, the residents have also had a say in the decision-making process.\n\nI believe that individuals should be free to live their lives according to their own values and principles, and as such, they should have the same opportunities and rights as heterosexual individuals. This is why I think it's essential to let each state decide whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal government should not impose its will on the states, as this would undermine the principles of local governance.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced that the President's personal opinion on the matter should dictate the nation's stance. Given the limited time left in President Bush's term, it's likely that the issue will be revisited by future administrations. Rather than creating a national debate, it would be more practical to allow each state to handle the matter according to its own values and priorities.\n\nUltimately, this issue should be left to the discretion of each state, as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision. This approach respects the diversity of the nation and allows for a more inclusive and adaptive response to the complexities of modern society.",
            "When considering the intersection of online privacy and school safety, it's essential to acknowledge that online platforms like Myspace are inherently public spaces. By definition, posting content on such sites makes it accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. \n\nIn the case of a student posting potentially incriminating content online, it's reasonable for school officials to have access to that information, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school's name. The notion that officials can access this information from their personal residences is a reality, and it underscores the need for responsible online behavior among students.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring online activity raises concerns about privacy. While it's understandable that schools may want to ensure a safe environment, overstepping into the realm of monitoring students' personal online lives can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThis is a delicate balance, especially considering the potential consequences of not taking proactive measures to prevent incidents like school shootings. While it's true that school officials may have legitimate reasons for monitoring online activity, it's also essential to respect students' right to online privacy. \n\nIn some cases, school officials may use online monitoring as a means to identify potential issues and prevent them from escalating. For instance, if a student is posting about substance use or other concerning behavior, it's reasonable for officials to take note and address the situation. However, this approach must be carefully managed to avoid crossing the line into excessive monitoring.\n\nWhen discussing this topic with a former teacher, I was reminded of the importance of school safety drills and lockdown procedures. These measures are put in place to ensure the well-being of students in the event of an emergency, such as a school shooting. While the specific incident I'm referring to may seem unrelated, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context of school safety and the measures taken to prevent incidents.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials is to create a safe and supportive environment for students. While online monitoring can be a valuable tool in achieving this goal, it's crucial to strike a balance between safety and privacy. By being mindful of these considerations, we can work towards creating a more effective and responsible approach to school safety.",
            "My initial perspective on the war was shaped by the personal impact of 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation now, I realize that our entry into the conflict was likely premature and misguided. While the emotional response to the tragedy was understandable, it appears that we overlooked several crucial aspects and failed to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nOur forces were sent to the region without adequate preparation, and the nature of war in the target country is vastly different from what we experience. The local culture and methods of warfare are often brutal and driven by a desire for self-preservation, rather than a genuine interest in nation-building.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems that our primary motivation for going to war was a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The decision to invade Iraq was likely influenced by a mix of public sentiment and a perceived need for action following 9/11. While I understand the sentiment behind this decision, I now believe that it was a hasty and misguided one.\n\nLooking back, it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges we would face. A more measured approach, with a clear plan and a deeper understanding of the local culture, would have been more effective in the long run. Unfortunately, our impulsive response led to a situation that has been difficult to extricate ourselves from.\n\nThe reality is that the country we intervened in is unlikely to change its fundamental nature, and our attempts to impose our will on them have been counterproductive. In many ways, our presence has become a catalyst for further division and conflict, rather than a force for stability.\n\nWhile we have made some progress, it's clear that our presence is no longer tenable. The fact is that we can't stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued involvement is only serving to perpetuate a cycle of violence and instability. It's time for us to acknowledge that our intervention has not achieved its intended goals and to begin planning for a responsible exit strategy."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on certain issues in order to prevent a decline in its followers. One of the primary reasons for this decline, as noted by various discussions, is the Church's perceived inflexibility in accepting modern values and perspectives. Specifically, its strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control may be contributing to a growing divide between the Church and its adherents. \n\nWhile the Church's convictions on these matters are understandable, they may seem outdated to some. By adjusting its stance to reflect a more contemporary outlook, the Church may be able to mitigate the loss of its following. Observers have noted that some individuals are beginning to disaffiliate with the Church due to disagreements over these issues, indicating a widening gap between the Church's views and those of its members. \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights may feel uncomfortable within a community that views the practice as morally reprehensible. Similarly, those who advocate for gay marriage may not feel welcome in a Church that does not recognize their union. The Church's stance on these matters can create a sense of dissonance and potentially drive individuals away. \n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is also a point of contention. While it is unclear whether allowing priests to be married or ordaining women as priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have fostered a more accepting environment. The Church's doctrine views priests as married to God, but this does not preclude the possibility of priests having a personal life outside of their faith. Many professionals lead dual lives, balancing their work and personal responsibilities. There is no apparent reason why priests should be held to a different standard. \n\nBy reevaluating its stance on these issues, the Catholic Church may be able to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that aligns with the values of its followers. This, in turn, could help prevent the continued decline in its following and foster a more harmonious relationship between the Church and its adherents.",
            "While I, personally, have not taken a strong stance on the matter, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. The concept of same-sex marriage is a topic that has sparked much debate, and I think it's essential to approach it with an open mind.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that sexual orientation does not seem to be a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it's unfair to hold them responsible for something that is an inherent aspect of who they are.\n\nFrom my perspective, it appears that the government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted. This is not a matter of national security or moral concerns but rather a personal aspect of an individual's life. It's essential to respect people's choices and identities, and the government should not overstep its bounds by imposing its views.\n\nIn my opinion, the government should not dictate how individuals choose to live their lives. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and it's essential to respect that. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or retribution. This includes those who identify as gay or LGBTQ+, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and respect their rights.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is an issue that warrants serious consideration. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions about the nature of homosexual relationships. However, a closer examination reveals that these relationships are not fundamentally different from heterosexual ones. In fact, research suggests that gay couples exhibit similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding gay marriage is the potential impact on the institution of marriage itself. However, this concern is misguided, as gay couples are not seeking to redefine marriage in a religious context, but rather to obtain a legal recognition of their relationship through a civil marriage certificate. This distinction is crucial, as it separates the issue from religious doctrine and focuses on the legal and social implications.\n\nThe notion that gay marriage poses a threat to traditional family values is also an oversimplification. In reality, the structure and roles within gay relationships are diverse and varied, much like those in heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, the argument that gay couples are not suitable parents due to their sexual orientation is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, research suggests that children raised by gay parents are no more likely to experience difficulties than those raised by heterosexual parents.\n\nThe treatment of children of gay parents in schools is a particularly disturbing aspect of this issue. The existence of special schools for children of gay parents in cities like New York highlights the need for greater acceptance and understanding. Rather than stigmatizing these children, we should focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nThe federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. By making gay marriage legal nationwide, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated equally under the law. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only morally reprehensible but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nLastly, it is essential to acknowledge the harm caused by perpetuating myths about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or the result of childhood trauma. By ignoring scientific evidence and instead relying on anecdotal opinions and popular culture, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a matter of human dignity and equality. By recognizing the similarities between gay and heterosexual relationships and promoting a culture of acceptance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
            "One of the key aspects of my experience working in a hospital pharmacy is the nuanced understanding of the relationship between a substance's legal status and its therapeutic value. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a drug does not necessarily negate its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I firmly believe that certain substances should not be accessible to the general public, their controlled use in a medical context is a different matter altogether. The fact that certain substances are restricted in their availability does not preclude their usefulness in a controlled environment. For instance, many pharmaceuticals that are classified as controlled substances, such as oxycodone and Vicodin, are regularly utilized in pharmacies due to their proven therapeutic benefits. This serves as a prime example of how the stigma surrounding a substance can hinder its acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is a complex issue. While it's true that excessive consumption of either substance can lead to negative consequences, I believe that it's crucial to separate the two in this context. The differing levels of social acceptance and regulation surrounding marijuana contribute to its often-misguided reputation. It's essential to reevaluate this stigma and consider the potential benefits of marijuana in a controlled environment.\n\nA more measured approach to addressing the issue of marijuana's illegality might be to first work on changing the public's perception of the substance. By doing so, individuals may be more inclined to use it responsibly, particularly in cases where it could be beneficial for medicinal purposes. I firmly believe that a more informed and open-minded approach to marijuana could lead to its more widespread acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.",
            "Over the past century, I've noticed a shift in the way the church adapts to the changing times. The once traditional Sunday masses have evolved into a more modern and casual setting. Gone are the days of donning elaborate outfits and picture-perfect appearances; today, people attend mass in jeans and khakis, reflecting the relaxed atmosphere that pervades the community. Families with young children often arrive fashionably late, adding to the casual vibe. This transformation has been particularly evident during summer masses, where beachwear is not uncommon.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I recall attending a private school on the weekends, where I would see friends and classmates every Sunday. The church became a hub for socializing and community building, rather than a strictly traditional gathering. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it easier for people to incorporate faith into their busy schedules.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I don't believe that allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented these incidents. While some might argue that marriage or a more inclusive clergy could have mitigated the problem, I firmly believe that the root of the issue lies in the individual's inherent nature. Research suggests that pedophilia may be linked to genetics, rather than environmental factors. This understanding is supported by studies that indicate a strong genetic component to the condition.\n\nIn cases where clergy members have engaged in such behavior, it's essential to acknowledge that their actions are a result of their personal choices and not a result of their marital status or position within the church. If someone with a predisposition to pedophilia were to get married, it's unlikely that their behavior would change. In fact, their actions might remain hidden for a time, only to surface later. Therefore, I don't think that the church's policies on marriage or clergy composition would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone significant changes, its ability to prevent pedophilia is not directly related to its policies on marriage or clergy. Rather, it's essential to address the root causes of such behavior and hold individuals accountable for their actions. If the church is found to have knowingly covered up such incidents, it's unacceptable and deserves condemnation.",
            "While the initial premise may have sparked some initial acceptance, I believe the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks created a complex geopolitical climate that contributed to the US decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration's assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved false, has been a contentious issue that continues to weigh heavily on my conscience. This deception, coupled with the administration's apparent disregard for the truth, has raised serious concerns about the erosion of the US's constitutional framework.\n\nThe revelation that Colin Powell, then-US Secretary of State, expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the UN, underscores the gravity of the situation. The notion that the administration prioritized its agenda over the well-being of the American people is a notion that has left a lasting impression. Furthermore, the perception that the Bush administration sought to circumvent the Constitution, often under the guise of national security, has only served to exacerbate these concerns.\n\nThe notion that the US invaded Iraq with the intention of expanding its energy interests, as alleged by a former high-ranking official, has further fueled my skepticism about the motivations behind the war. The consequences of this decision have been far-reaching, with the country teetering on the brink of chaos and the potential for civil war.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, the proposed solution of a coalition-led intervention, comprising nations from the surrounding region, has its own set of challenges. The risk of undermining Iraq's sovereignty, already a pressing concern, is a significant one. The difficulties in establishing a stable and effective government, as evident from the current state of the Iraqi Parliament, only serve to highlight the complexity of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I remain uncertain about the long-term implications of the invasion, and the continued involvement of the US in Iraq's affairs. While I can appreciate the need for a solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is required to address the multifaceted challenges facing the region.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the nuances of a situation that has garnered significant attention globally. Initially, I had reservations about the conflict, viewing it as a response to the 9/11 attacks rather than a declared war. As I delved deeper, I began to consider the underlying motivations behind the U.S. presence in Iraq. It appears that the primary goal was to establish a democratic government, mirroring the American system, and secure access to Iraqi oil reserves. However, this approach has been met with resistance, and the conflict has become increasingly contentious.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for cultural insensitivity and the risk of imposing Western values on an alien culture. The longer we remain in Iraq, the more we risk exacerbating existing tensions and potentially creating more enemies. The Al-Qaeda issue is a significant factor, as our attempts to impose democracy may be perceived as a form of cultural imperialism, fueling further hatred towards the U.S.\n\nMoreover, the war has had a profound impact on the people of Iraq, leaving many without basic necessities like education and safety. The presence of various factions vying for power has created a complex and volatile environment, making it challenging to establish a stable government. The ongoing conflict raises questions about the effectiveness of our military strategy and the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nWhile it's difficult to provide a clear-cut solution, I believe that a more measured approach is necessary. We must consider the potential consequences of our actions and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the situation. It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of the conflict and the diverse perspectives involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the War in Iraq are shaped by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that a more thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach is necessary to address the complexities of this situation.",
            "The notion that the government should have the authority to declare certain religious practices legal or illegal strikes me as problematic. The concept of separation of church and state, enshrined in the constitution, implies that such decisions should be left to the churches themselves. This separation serves as a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to hold diverse beliefs without fear of persecution.\n\nEfforts to introduce legislation or amendments that could restrict certain religious practices seem counterintuitive, given the principles of the constitution. In fact, such an amendment would be a departure from the fundamental principles of the document. Moreover, it could be argued that such a move would be an unusual instance of government overreach, as it would impose restrictions on the people rather than the government.\n\nThe motivations behind such an amendment are also cause for concern. If the primary driving force is a personal preference for a particular faith, it raises questions about the impartiality of the government in making decisions that affect the religious freedoms of all citizens. By doing so, it could be perceived as favoring one religion over others.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the impact of such an amendment is unclear, but it's possible that it could have unforeseen benefits on society. However, this seems a tenuous argument for restricting religious freedoms.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what practices are acceptable or not should be left to the churches, as they are best equipped to make informed decisions about the values and principles of their respective faiths. The government's role is to ensure that these decisions do not infringe on the rights of others, not to impose its own will on the people.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of US Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and one that I believe was marred by a lack of transparency and foresight on the part of the US government. The administration's narrative linking the 9/11 attacks to Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities was misleading, and it capitalized on the American people's outrage and fear to justify the invasion.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I was particularly concerned about the preemptive strike on Iraq. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam conflict are striking, with both instances involving a foreign government imposing its will on a sovereign nation, often with disastrous consequences. The US government's failure to learn from past mistakes is a troubling aspect of its decision-making process.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been staggering, with countless American lives lost and a protracted occupation that has shown no signs of resolution. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime created a power vacuum, which the US government was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath was marked by chaos, sectarian violence, and a protracted insurgency that has left the Iraqi people traumatized.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that the US government underestimated the complexities of nation-building and the difficulty of establishing a stable democracy in a war-torn country. The experience in Iraq serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of military intervention and the importance of thorough planning and consideration of long-term consequences.\n\nThe war in Iraq also raises questions about the motivations behind US foreign policy. The pursuit of oil and strategic interests has often been cited as a primary driver of US foreign policy, and the Iraq War is no exception. The lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the decision to invade has contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue that involved a range of factors, including politics, economics, and ideology. While it is difficult to predict the future, I hope that the US government will learn from the lessons of Iraq and approach future conflicts with a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to grapple with, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, as I reflect on the war, I am struck by the human cost and the sense of moral obligation that comes with intervening in a foreign country. The question of when to intervene and how to do so in a way that minimizes harm is a critical one that requires careful consideration and a commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the Iraq War serves as a reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of international relations and the importance of critically evaluating the motivations and actions of those in power.",
            "When considering the issue of gay marriage, I firmly believe that it is a matter of personal preference, one that has been increasingly linked to biological factors rather than sociological influences. Research suggests that there may be a genetic component to sexual orientation, which raises questions about the legitimacy of denying rights to individuals based on something that is largely beyond their control.\n\nThe idea that government and politics should play a role in this matter seems not only misguided but also inhumane. Marriage is a deeply personal and private affair, one that should be left to individuals to decide for themselves, without the interference of external entities. I've witnessed firsthand the loving relationships between gay couples in my community, who live and contribute to society just like any other family.\n\nThe notion that certain groups or individuals can dictate the definition of marriage is not only absurd but also an attempt to impose their will on others. In this case, I believe President Bush's stance on the matter is particularly problematic, as it seeks to reinterpret the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda.\n\nStudies have shown that there may be a chemical component to sexual orientation, which is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This suggests that being gay is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of one's identity. In light of this, it's hard to understand why gay couples are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the most striking disparities in this issue is the double standard that exists. When a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so in private, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a public spectacle, with the media and government scrutinizing every aspect of their relationship. This highlights the need for a more private and personal approach to marriage, one that respects the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices.\n\nOverall, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and equality, and that government and politics should not interfere with the rights of individuals to love and commit to one another.",
            "When something is posted online, it becomes public domain, available for anyone to see. As an RA, I've encountered instances where this has become a pressing concern. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information, especially when it comes to discussions about violent or disturbing topics. The internet's vast reach means that even seemingly private conversations can be accessed by a wide audience, including schools and law enforcement.\n\nIn our school, a recent incident highlighted the importance of this issue. A student shared some concerning comments online, which were later reported to the authorities. It's crucial to acknowledge that online statements, no matter how lighthearted they may seem, can be misinterpreted or taken seriously in the wrong context. This can lead to serious consequences, as in the case of the incident mentioned earlier.\n\nThe power dynamics between students and school officials are also worth examining. While it's understandable that students may not want their personal lives monitored, it's also true that school administrators have a responsibility to act on concerns that may indicate potential threats to student safety. However, this should be done in a way that respects student boundaries and doesn't involve unwarranted surveillance.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to strike a balance between free speech and responsibility. As an RA, I believe it's crucial to educate students about the potential consequences of their online actions and to encourage them to think critically about what they share online. This includes being mindful of their online presence and the potential impact it may have on their relationships and reputation.\n\nBy being aware of these complexities, we can work towards creating a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone involved.",
            "It's been a prolonged and seemingly inconclusive conflict, with its original objectives losing clarity over time. Initially, the goal was to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair government. While that objective is commendable, it's possible that personal animosities between key figures, such as the pre-existing tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAs the war has dragged on, it's become increasingly difficult to discern a clear purpose. The initial phases of the conflict, however, did serve as a powerful statement in support of democracy. Unfortunately, the prolonged nature of the war has compromised its original objectives and led to a loss of focus.\n\nOne could argue that the war's continuation stems from a desire to assert global dominance rather than a genuine commitment to promoting democracy. It's worth considering whether the initial motivations were truly altruistic or if they were driven by less noble intentions.\n\nGiven the immense financial and human costs, it's reasonable to question the war's continued relevance. The funds spent on this conflict could be better utilized to address pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. The fact that we're diverting resources away from our own nation's needs and toward a foreign conflict is a pressing concern.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's imperative to reassess our priorities and reevaluate the war's purpose. It's time for a decisive conclusion, allowing the affected nation to assume responsibility for its own governance and for us to redirect our resources toward more pressing domestic challenges.",
            "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences. This can make it challenging to determine who is genuinely interested in connecting with me and who might be seeking to exploit this information.\n\nIn my own case, I try to strike a balance between sharing enough information to connect with friends and keeping certain details private. However, it's difficult to know exactly what information is being shared and with whom, especially when interacting with people I don't know.\n\nA recent news story about someone using social media to gather information about a young girl and manipulate her highlights the potential risks of online interactions. While I wouldn't engage with someone who I didn't know online, I have experienced instances where people I don't recognize have contacted me through instant messaging, which raises concerns about their intentions.\n\nI also recall a situation where my roommate's high school had banned students from using Myspace, which led to a discussion about the school's authority in this matter. While I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, it did raise questions about the school's right to dictate what students can and cannot do online.\n\nThese are some of the thoughts that come to mind when considering the intersection of social media, privacy, and safety.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered widespread international condemnation. While it's natural to approach this topic with a sense of trepidation, considering the numerous polls and surveys that have been conducted on the matter, it's worth examining the broader context in which the war was initiated.\n\nAccording to various polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, a significant majority of the population – roughly 75 to 80% – views the war as a misstep. Within Iraq, a significant portion of the population shares this sentiment, with 80% advocating for a swift withdrawal. Similarly, a substantial number of US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, believe that the war was a misguided decision and that a withdrawal within a year would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe war's outcome has been widely regarded as a disaster, with many arguing that it was already a catastrophe before the US involvement. The attempt to impose democracy on a region with fundamentally different cultural values has been met with skepticism, and the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states appears insurmountable.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam Hussein was a troublesome leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of invasion before embarking on such a significant endeavor. The consequences of invading a country can be far-reaching and devastating, as seen in the case of Iraq.\n\nGiven the overwhelming international and regional support for a swift withdrawal, it's puzzling that the US administration continues to justify extended involvement. While it's understandable that they may be concerned about the potential consequences of a hasty exit, it's difficult to identify a compelling reason to maintain the current status quo.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a more palatable option, but the underlying question remains: why should the US continue to occupy Iraq? The Iraqi people, whom we aim to assist and protect, are clearly signaling that they want us to leave, and it's worth considering their perspective. By heeding their advice, we may be able to avoid further entanglement in a complex and intractable conflict.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to acknowledge the limits of our influence in the Middle East and to recognize that our actions will never be perceived as altruistic. However, by withdrawing from Iraq, we may be able to mitigate the damage and create a more favorable environment for future engagement.",
            "While societal progress has been made, I firmly believe that gender discrimination still persists in the United States. This issue extends beyond women, as it is deeply intertwined with the specific field or workplace in question. For instance, women often face significant challenges in the business world due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even with equal qualifications, they may struggle to advance to leadership positions. This stems from a long-standing societal bias, where men are often seen as the dominant force in the corporate world.\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in upper-management roles, leading to a reluctance to promote them to key positions. Conversely, men in non-traditional professions, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face prejudice due to societal expectations that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance, as some individuals view men in these roles as deviating from traditional norms.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender-based biases are evident. Men who pursue careers in fashion may be dismissed due to preconceived notions about their masculinity or style. This can lead to a lack of credibility, with some individuals questioning whether men in the fashion industry truly understand the needs of their female clients. However, as more men enter the field and share their perspectives, attitudes are beginning to shift.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. Rather than forcing change, it's necessary to create a gradual shift in societal attitudes. This can be achieved by showcasing the accomplishments and contributions of underrepresented groups, without being overly aggressive or pushy.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It's crucial to recognize that individuals can be discriminated against based on various factors, including their background, education, or even their accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged based on their grammar rather than their intelligence or capabilities.\n\nUltimately, overcoming these biases will require a continued effort to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can work towards a more equitable society where individuals are judged on their merits, regardless of their gender, background, or profession.",
            "In my understanding, the move to decriminalize marijuana has effectively downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. This shift has significant implications, particularly in job interviews and future opportunities, where a marijuana charge can have far-reaching consequences. While this decriminalization may alleviate some of the worst ramifications associated with a drug charge, the long-term effects on one's record can persist.\n\nHowever, there is another side to the argument. The costs associated with arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses can be substantial. From law enforcement expenses to court proceedings and public defenders, the financial burden on municipalities can be considerable. In some cases, these costs can be a significant factor in a community's decision-making process, particularly when they are struggling financially.\n\nDenver serves as an interesting example, as its relatively liberal attitude towards marijuana has allowed the city to redirect funds towards more pressing issues, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless. By decriminalizing marijuana, Denver has been able to allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nWhile it's true that complete legalization of marijuana could have its drawbacks, such as increased public consumption and potential coordination with driving, it's also essential to acknowledge the nuances of individual reactions to the substance. Research has shown that people respond differently to marijuana, and some may be more susceptible to its adverse effects than others. Personalities, moderation, and individual circumstances all play a significant role in determining how one interacts with marijuana.\n\nUltimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. It's crucial to recognize that people's experiences with substances are unique, and a more thoughtful approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding marijuana use.",
            "My stance on this issue is yes, albeit with certain reservations. While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships. My own family's experience illustrates this point; my parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in a Catholic ceremony due to their differing faiths.\n\nThis dichotomy between doctrine and practice is a significant issue within the Catholic Church. While the Church's teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and love, its rigid adherence to tradition often undermines these values. This has led me to question the effectiveness of certain Church practices and policies.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marital status, it's essential to separate the potential benefits of allowing priests to marry from the underlying causes of clergy misconduct. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could help prevent certain behaviors, I believe that such actions are often driven by deeper psychological issues. Ultimately, the relationship between marriage and clergy misconduct is complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the value of tradition, I also believe that the Catholic Church must re-examine its practices and policies to ensure they align with its core teachings. By doing so, the Church can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment that truly reflects its values.",
            "The issue at hand is a complex one, and I am still in the process of forming a well-rounded opinion. Both sides of the debate present valid arguments, making it challenging to definitively declare a winner. One of the primary difficulties lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state. The concept of marriage, particularly in its definition, raises questions about the role of government intervention.\n\nWhile many view marriage as a sacrament, others see it as a civil union, which has significant implications for taxation and government recognition. For instance, individuals who have been baptized may receive certain benefits. I believe that the government should consider marriage as a civil union, focusing on the union of two individuals rather than the specifics of the ceremony. This approach avoids entangling church and state, allowing individuals to define their union according to their personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, I believe that the primary concern should be the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, not the label attached to their union. In the event that all states can come to a mutually agreeable decision, a federal law would be a more practical solution than a constitutional amendment. However, altering the constitution to ban gay marriage would be an extreme measure, as it is a relatively minor issue compared to the weight and significance of constitutional amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and its definition requires careful consideration of the separation of church and state, individual rights, and the role of government intervention. A more nuanced approach would prioritize civil unions and the inherent value of all individuals, rather than focusing on specific labels or definitions.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has led me to develop a nuanced perspective on the issue of homosexuality. While I have close friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I don't necessarily align with the entire spectrum of the gay rights movement. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their personal lives, and therefore, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think the decision should be left to the federal government, as this is a matter of state-level politics. Each state has its unique cultural and social dynamics, and it's essential to respect the democratic process. In democratic states, the residents are likely to have already expressed their views on the issue through their elected representatives. Conversely, in more conservative states, the residents have also had a say in the decision-making process.\n\nI believe that individuals should be free to live their lives according to their own values and principles, and as such, they should have the same opportunities and rights as heterosexual individuals. This is why I think it's essential to let each state decide whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal government should not impose its will on the states, as this would undermine the principles of local governance.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced that the President's personal opinion on the matter should dictate the nation's stance. Given the limited time left in President Bush's term, it's likely that the issue will be revisited by future administrations. Rather than creating a national debate, it would be more practical to allow each state to handle the matter according to its own values and priorities.\n\nUltimately, this issue should be left to the discretion of each state, as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision. This approach respects the diversity of the nation and allows for a more inclusive and adaptive response to the complexities of modern society.",
            "When considering the intersection of online privacy and school safety, it's essential to acknowledge that online platforms like Myspace are inherently public spaces. By definition, posting content on such sites makes it accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. \n\nIn the case of a student posting potentially incriminating content online, it's reasonable for school officials to have access to that information, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school's name. The notion that officials can access this information from their personal residences is a reality, and it underscores the need for responsible online behavior among students.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring online activity raises concerns about privacy. While it's understandable that schools may want to ensure a safe environment, overstepping into the realm of monitoring students' personal online lives can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThis is a delicate balance, especially considering the potential consequences of not taking proactive measures to prevent incidents like school shootings. While it's true that school officials may have legitimate reasons for monitoring online activity, it's also essential to respect students' right to online privacy. \n\nIn some cases, school officials may use online monitoring as a means to identify potential issues and prevent them from escalating. For instance, if a student is posting about substance use or other concerning behavior, it's reasonable for officials to take note and address the situation. However, this approach must be carefully managed to avoid crossing the line into excessive monitoring.\n\nWhen discussing this topic with a former teacher, I was reminded of the importance of school safety drills and lockdown procedures. These measures are put in place to ensure the well-being of students in the event of an emergency, such as a school shooting. While the specific incident I'm referring to may seem unrelated, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context of school safety and the measures taken to prevent incidents.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials is to create a safe and supportive environment for students. While online monitoring can be a valuable tool in achieving this goal, it's crucial to strike a balance between safety and privacy. By being mindful of these considerations, we can work towards creating a more effective and responsible approach to school safety.",
            "My initial perspective on the war was shaped by the personal impact of 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation now, I realize that our entry into the conflict was likely premature and misguided. While the emotional response to the tragedy was understandable, it appears that we overlooked several crucial aspects and failed to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nOur forces were sent to the region without adequate preparation, and the nature of war in the target country is vastly different from what we experience. The local culture and methods of warfare are often brutal and driven by a desire for self-preservation, rather than a genuine interest in nation-building.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems that our primary motivation for going to war was a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The decision to invade Iraq was likely influenced by a mix of public sentiment and a perceived need for action following 9/11. While I understand the sentiment behind this decision, I now believe that it was a hasty and misguided one.\n\nLooking back, it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges we would face. A more measured approach, with a clear plan and a deeper understanding of the local culture, would have been more effective in the long run. Unfortunately, our impulsive response led to a situation that has been difficult to extricate ourselves from.\n\nThe reality is that the country we intervened in is unlikely to change its fundamental nature, and our attempts to impose our will on them have been counterproductive. In many ways, our presence has become a catalyst for further division and conflict, rather than a force for stability.\n\nWhile we have made some progress, it's clear that our presence is no longer tenable. The fact is that we can't stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued involvement is only serving to perpetuate a cycle of violence and instability. It's time for us to acknowledge that our intervention has not achieved its intended goals and to begin planning for a responsible exit strategy."
