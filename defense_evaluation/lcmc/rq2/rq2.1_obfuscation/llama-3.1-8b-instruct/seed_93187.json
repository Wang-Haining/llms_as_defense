            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on certain issues in order to prevent a decline in its followers. One of the primary reasons for this decline, as noted by various discussions, is the Church's perceived inflexibility in accepting modern values and perspectives. Specifically, its strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control may be contributing to a growing divide between the Church and its adherents. \n\nWhile the Church's convictions on these matters are understandable, they may seem outdated to some. By adjusting its stance to reflect a more contemporary outlook, the Church may be able to mitigate the loss of its following. Observers have noted that some individuals are beginning to disaffiliate with the Church due to disagreements over these issues, indicating a widening gap between the Church's views and those of its members. \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights may feel uncomfortable within a community that views the practice as morally reprehensible. Similarly, those who advocate for gay marriage may not feel welcome in a Church that does not recognize their union. The Church's stance on these matters can create a sense of dissonance and potentially drive individuals away. \n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is also a point of contention. While it is unclear whether allowing priests to be married or ordaining women as priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have fostered a more accepting environment. The Church's doctrine views priests as married to God, but this does not preclude the possibility of priests having a personal life outside of their faith. Many professionals lead dual lives, balancing their work and personal responsibilities. There is no apparent reason why priests should be held to a different standard. \n\nBy reevaluating its stance on these issues, the Catholic Church may be able to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that aligns with the values of its followers. This, in turn, could help prevent the continued decline in its following and foster a more harmonious relationship between the Church and its adherents.",
            "While I, personally, have not taken a strong stance on the matter, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. The concept of same-sex marriage is a topic that has sparked much debate, and I think it's essential to approach it with an open mind.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that sexual orientation does not seem to be a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it's unfair to hold them responsible for something that is an inherent aspect of who they are.\n\nFrom my perspective, it appears that the government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted. This is not a matter of national security or moral concerns but rather a personal aspect of an individual's life. It's essential to respect people's choices and identities, and the government should not overstep its bounds by imposing its views.\n\nIn my opinion, the government should not dictate how individuals choose to live their lives. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and it's essential to respect that. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or retribution. This includes those who identify as gay or LGBTQ+, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and respect their rights.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is an issue that warrants serious consideration. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions about the nature of homosexual relationships. However, a closer examination reveals that these relationships are not fundamentally different from heterosexual ones. In fact, research suggests that gay couples exhibit similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding gay marriage is the potential impact on the institution of marriage itself. However, this concern is misguided, as gay couples are not seeking to redefine marriage in a religious context, but rather to obtain a legal recognition of their relationship through a civil marriage certificate. This distinction is crucial, as it separates the issue from religious doctrine and focuses on the legal and social implications.\n\nThe notion that gay marriage poses a threat to traditional family values is also an oversimplification. In reality, the structure and roles within gay relationships are diverse and varied, much like those in heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, the argument that gay couples are not suitable parents due to their sexual orientation is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, research suggests that children raised by gay parents are no more likely to experience difficulties than those raised by heterosexual parents.\n\nThe treatment of children of gay parents in schools is a particularly disturbing aspect of this issue. The existence of special schools for children of gay parents in cities like New York highlights the need for greater acceptance and understanding. Rather than stigmatizing these children, we should focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nThe federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. By making gay marriage legal nationwide, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated equally under the law. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only morally reprehensible but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nLastly, it is essential to acknowledge the harm caused by perpetuating myths about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or the result of childhood trauma. By ignoring scientific evidence and instead relying on anecdotal opinions and popular culture, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a matter of human dignity and equality. By recognizing the similarities between gay and heterosexual relationships and promoting a culture of acceptance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
            "One of the key aspects of my experience working in a hospital pharmacy is the nuanced understanding of the relationship between a substance's legal status and its therapeutic value. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a drug does not necessarily negate its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I firmly believe that certain substances should not be accessible to the general public, their controlled use in a medical context is a different matter altogether. The fact that certain substances are restricted in their availability does not preclude their usefulness in a controlled environment. For instance, many pharmaceuticals that are classified as controlled substances, such as oxycodone and Vicodin, are regularly utilized in pharmacies due to their proven therapeutic benefits. This serves as a prime example of how the stigma surrounding a substance can hinder its acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is a complex issue. While it's true that excessive consumption of either substance can lead to negative consequences, I believe that it's crucial to separate the two in this context. The differing levels of social acceptance and regulation surrounding marijuana contribute to its often-misguided reputation. It's essential to reevaluate this stigma and consider the potential benefits of marijuana in a controlled environment.\n\nA more measured approach to addressing the issue of marijuana's illegality might be to first work on changing the public's perception of the substance. By doing so, individuals may be more inclined to use it responsibly, particularly in cases where it could be beneficial for medicinal purposes. I firmly believe that a more informed and open-minded approach to marijuana could lead to its more widespread acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.",
            "Over the past century, I've noticed a shift in the way the church adapts to the changing times. The once traditional Sunday masses have evolved into a more modern and casual setting. Gone are the days of donning elaborate outfits and picture-perfect appearances; today, people attend mass in jeans and khakis, reflecting the relaxed atmosphere that pervades the community. Families with young children often arrive fashionably late, adding to the casual vibe. This transformation has been particularly evident during summer masses, where beachwear is not uncommon.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I recall attending a private school on the weekends, where I would see friends and classmates every Sunday. The church became a hub for socializing and community building, rather than a strictly traditional gathering. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it easier for people to incorporate faith into their busy schedules.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I don't believe that allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented these incidents. While some might argue that marriage or a more inclusive clergy could have mitigated the problem, I firmly believe that the root of the issue lies in the individual's inherent nature. Research suggests that pedophilia may be linked to genetics, rather than environmental factors. This understanding is supported by studies that indicate a strong genetic component to the condition.\n\nIn cases where clergy members have engaged in such behavior, it's essential to acknowledge that their actions are a result of their personal choices and not a result of their marital status or position within the church. If someone with a predisposition to pedophilia were to get married, it's unlikely that their behavior would change. In fact, their actions might remain hidden for a time, only to surface later. Therefore, I don't think that the church's policies on marriage or clergy composition would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone significant changes, its ability to prevent pedophilia is not directly related to its policies on marriage or clergy. Rather, it's essential to address the root causes of such behavior and hold individuals accountable for their actions. If the church is found to have knowingly covered up such incidents, it's unacceptable and deserves condemnation.",
            "While the initial premise may have sparked some initial acceptance, I believe the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks created a complex geopolitical climate that contributed to the US decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration's assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved false, has been a contentious issue that continues to weigh heavily on my conscience. This deception, coupled with the administration's apparent disregard for the truth, has raised serious concerns about the erosion of the US's constitutional framework.\n\nThe revelation that Colin Powell, then-US Secretary of State, expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the UN, underscores the gravity of the situation. The notion that the administration prioritized its agenda over the well-being of the American people is a notion that has left a lasting impression. Furthermore, the perception that the Bush administration sought to circumvent the Constitution, often under the guise of national security, has only served to exacerbate these concerns.\n\nThe notion that the US invaded Iraq with the intention of expanding its energy interests, as alleged by a former high-ranking official, has further fueled my skepticism about the motivations behind the war. The consequences of this decision have been far-reaching, with the country teetering on the brink of chaos and the potential for civil war.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, the proposed solution of a coalition-led intervention, comprising nations from the surrounding region, has its own set of challenges. The risk of undermining Iraq's sovereignty, already a pressing concern, is a significant one. The difficulties in establishing a stable and effective government, as evident from the current state of the Iraqi Parliament, only serve to highlight the complexity of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I remain uncertain about the long-term implications of the invasion, and the continued involvement of the US in Iraq's affairs. While I can appreciate the need for a solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is required to address the multifaceted challenges facing the region.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the nuances of a situation that has garnered significant attention globally. Initially, I had reservations about the conflict, viewing it as a response to the 9/11 attacks rather than a declared war. As I delved deeper, I began to consider the underlying motivations behind the U.S. presence in Iraq. It appears that the primary goal was to establish a democratic government, mirroring the American system, and secure access to Iraqi oil reserves. However, this approach has been met with resistance, and the conflict has become increasingly contentious.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for cultural insensitivity and the risk of imposing Western values on an alien culture. The longer we remain in Iraq, the more we risk exacerbating existing tensions and potentially creating more enemies. The Al-Qaeda issue is a significant factor, as our attempts to impose democracy may be perceived as a form of cultural imperialism, fueling further hatred towards the U.S.\n\nMoreover, the war has had a profound impact on the people of Iraq, leaving many without basic necessities like education and safety. The presence of various factions vying for power has created a complex and volatile environment, making it challenging to establish a stable government. The ongoing conflict raises questions about the effectiveness of our military strategy and the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nWhile it's difficult to provide a clear-cut solution, I believe that a more measured approach is necessary. We must consider the potential consequences of our actions and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the situation. It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of the conflict and the diverse perspectives involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the War in Iraq are shaped by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that a more thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach is necessary to address the complexities of this situation.",
            "The notion that the government should have the authority to declare certain religious practices legal or illegal strikes me as problematic. The concept of separation of church and state, enshrined in the constitution, implies that such decisions should be left to the churches themselves. This separation serves as a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to hold diverse beliefs without fear of persecution.\n\nEfforts to introduce legislation or amendments that could restrict certain religious practices seem counterintuitive, given the principles of the constitution. In fact, such an amendment would be a departure from the fundamental principles of the document. Moreover, it could be argued that such a move would be an unusual instance of government overreach, as it would impose restrictions on the people rather than the government.\n\nThe motivations behind such an amendment are also cause for concern. If the primary driving force is a personal preference for a particular faith, it raises questions about the impartiality of the government in making decisions that affect the religious freedoms of all citizens. By doing so, it could be perceived as favoring one religion over others.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the impact of such an amendment is unclear, but it's possible that it could have unforeseen benefits on society. However, this seems a tenuous argument for restricting religious freedoms.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what practices are acceptable or not should be left to the churches, as they are best equipped to make informed decisions about the values and principles of their respective faiths. The government's role is to ensure that these decisions do not infringe on the rights of others, not to impose its own will on the people.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of US Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and one that I believe was marred by a lack of transparency and foresight on the part of the US government. The administration's narrative linking the 9/11 attacks to Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities was misleading, and it capitalized on the American people's outrage and fear to justify the invasion.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I was particularly concerned about the preemptive strike on Iraq. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam conflict are striking, with both instances involving a foreign government imposing its will on a sovereign nation, often with disastrous consequences. The US government's failure to learn from past mistakes is a troubling aspect of its decision-making process.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been staggering, with countless American lives lost and a protracted occupation that has shown no signs of resolution. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime created a power vacuum, which the US government was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath was marked by chaos, sectarian violence, and a protracted insurgency that has left the Iraqi people traumatized.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that the US government underestimated the complexities of nation-building and the difficulty of establishing a stable democracy in a war-torn country. The experience in Iraq serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of military intervention and the importance of thorough planning and consideration of long-term consequences.\n\nThe war in Iraq also raises questions about the motivations behind US foreign policy. The pursuit of oil and strategic interests has often been cited as a primary driver of US foreign policy, and the Iraq War is no exception. The lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the decision to invade has contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue that involved a range of factors, including politics, economics, and ideology. While it is difficult to predict the future, I hope that the US government will learn from the lessons of Iraq and approach future conflicts with a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to grapple with, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, as I reflect on the war, I am struck by the human cost and the sense of moral obligation that comes with intervening in a foreign country. The question of when to intervene and how to do so in a way that minimizes harm is a critical one that requires careful consideration and a commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the Iraq War serves as a reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of international relations and the importance of critically evaluating the motivations and actions of those in power.",
            "When considering the issue of gay marriage, I firmly believe that it is a matter of personal preference, one that has been increasingly linked to biological factors rather than sociological influences. Research suggests that there may be a genetic component to sexual orientation, which raises questions about the legitimacy of denying rights to individuals based on something that is largely beyond their control.\n\nThe idea that government and politics should play a role in this matter seems not only misguided but also inhumane. Marriage is a deeply personal and private affair, one that should be left to individuals to decide for themselves, without the interference of external entities. I've witnessed firsthand the loving relationships between gay couples in my community, who live and contribute to society just like any other family.\n\nThe notion that certain groups or individuals can dictate the definition of marriage is not only absurd but also an attempt to impose their will on others. In this case, I believe President Bush's stance on the matter is particularly problematic, as it seeks to reinterpret the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda.\n\nStudies have shown that there may be a chemical component to sexual orientation, which is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This suggests that being gay is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of one's identity. In light of this, it's hard to understand why gay couples are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the most striking disparities in this issue is the double standard that exists. When a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so in private, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a public spectacle, with the media and government scrutinizing every aspect of their relationship. This highlights the need for a more private and personal approach to marriage, one that respects the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices.\n\nOverall, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and equality, and that government and politics should not interfere with the rights of individuals to love and commit to one another.",
            "When something is posted online, it becomes public domain, available for anyone to see. As an RA, I've encountered instances where this has become a pressing concern. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information, especially when it comes to discussions about violent or disturbing topics. The internet's vast reach means that even seemingly private conversations can be accessed by a wide audience, including schools and law enforcement.\n\nIn our school, a recent incident highlighted the importance of this issue. A student shared some concerning comments online, which were later reported to the authorities. It's crucial to acknowledge that online statements, no matter how lighthearted they may seem, can be misinterpreted or taken seriously in the wrong context. This can lead to serious consequences, as in the case of the incident mentioned earlier.\n\nThe power dynamics between students and school officials are also worth examining. While it's understandable that students may not want their personal lives monitored, it's also true that school administrators have a responsibility to act on concerns that may indicate potential threats to student safety. However, this should be done in a way that respects student boundaries and doesn't involve unwarranted surveillance.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to strike a balance between free speech and responsibility. As an RA, I believe it's crucial to educate students about the potential consequences of their online actions and to encourage them to think critically about what they share online. This includes being mindful of their online presence and the potential impact it may have on their relationships and reputation.\n\nBy being aware of these complexities, we can work towards creating a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone involved.",
            "It's been a prolonged and seemingly inconclusive conflict, with its original objectives losing clarity over time. Initially, the goal was to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair government. While that objective is commendable, it's possible that personal animosities between key figures, such as the pre-existing tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAs the war has dragged on, it's become increasingly difficult to discern a clear purpose. The initial phases of the conflict, however, did serve as a powerful statement in support of democracy. Unfortunately, the prolonged nature of the war has compromised its original objectives and led to a loss of focus.\n\nOne could argue that the war's continuation stems from a desire to assert global dominance rather than a genuine commitment to promoting democracy. It's worth considering whether the initial motivations were truly altruistic or if they were driven by less noble intentions.\n\nGiven the immense financial and human costs, it's reasonable to question the war's continued relevance. The funds spent on this conflict could be better utilized to address pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. The fact that we're diverting resources away from our own nation's needs and toward a foreign conflict is a pressing concern.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's imperative to reassess our priorities and reevaluate the war's purpose. It's time for a decisive conclusion, allowing the affected nation to assume responsibility for its own governance and for us to redirect our resources toward more pressing domestic challenges.",
            "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences. This can make it challenging to determine who is genuinely interested in connecting with me and who might be seeking to exploit this information.\n\nIn my own case, I try to strike a balance between sharing enough information to connect with friends and keeping certain details private. However, it's difficult to know exactly what information is being shared and with whom, especially when interacting with people I don't know.\n\nA recent news story about someone using social media to gather information about a young girl and manipulate her highlights the potential risks of online interactions. While I wouldn't engage with someone who I didn't know online, I have experienced instances where people I don't recognize have contacted me through instant messaging, which raises concerns about their intentions.\n\nI also recall a situation where my roommate's high school had banned students from using Myspace, which led to a discussion about the school's authority in this matter. While I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, it did raise questions about the school's right to dictate what students can and cannot do online.\n\nThese are some of the thoughts that come to mind when considering the intersection of social media, privacy, and safety.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered widespread international condemnation. While it's natural to approach this topic with a sense of trepidation, considering the numerous polls and surveys that have been conducted on the matter, it's worth examining the broader context in which the war was initiated.\n\nAccording to various polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, a significant majority of the population – roughly 75 to 80% – views the war as a misstep. Within Iraq, a significant portion of the population shares this sentiment, with 80% advocating for a swift withdrawal. Similarly, a substantial number of US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, believe that the war was a misguided decision and that a withdrawal within a year would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe war's outcome has been widely regarded as a disaster, with many arguing that it was already a catastrophe before the US involvement. The attempt to impose democracy on a region with fundamentally different cultural values has been met with skepticism, and the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states appears insurmountable.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam Hussein was a troublesome leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of invasion before embarking on such a significant endeavor. The consequences of invading a country can be far-reaching and devastating, as seen in the case of Iraq.\n\nGiven the overwhelming international and regional support for a swift withdrawal, it's puzzling that the US administration continues to justify extended involvement. While it's understandable that they may be concerned about the potential consequences of a hasty exit, it's difficult to identify a compelling reason to maintain the current status quo.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a more palatable option, but the underlying question remains: why should the US continue to occupy Iraq? The Iraqi people, whom we aim to assist and protect, are clearly signaling that they want us to leave, and it's worth considering their perspective. By heeding their advice, we may be able to avoid further entanglement in a complex and intractable conflict.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to acknowledge the limits of our influence in the Middle East and to recognize that our actions will never be perceived as altruistic. However, by withdrawing from Iraq, we may be able to mitigate the damage and create a more favorable environment for future engagement.",
            "While societal progress has been made, I firmly believe that gender discrimination still persists in the United States. This issue extends beyond women, as it is deeply intertwined with the specific field or workplace in question. For instance, women often face significant challenges in the business world due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even with equal qualifications, they may struggle to advance to leadership positions. This stems from a long-standing societal bias, where men are often seen as the dominant force in the corporate world.\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in upper-management roles, leading to a reluctance to promote them to key positions. Conversely, men in non-traditional professions, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face prejudice due to societal expectations that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance, as some individuals view men in these roles as deviating from traditional norms.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender-based biases are evident. Men who pursue careers in fashion may be dismissed due to preconceived notions about their masculinity or style. This can lead to a lack of credibility, with some individuals questioning whether men in the fashion industry truly understand the needs of their female clients. However, as more men enter the field and share their perspectives, attitudes are beginning to shift.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. Rather than forcing change, it's necessary to create a gradual shift in societal attitudes. This can be achieved by showcasing the accomplishments and contributions of underrepresented groups, without being overly aggressive or pushy.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It's crucial to recognize that individuals can be discriminated against based on various factors, including their background, education, or even their accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged based on their grammar rather than their intelligence or capabilities.\n\nUltimately, overcoming these biases will require a continued effort to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can work towards a more equitable society where individuals are judged on their merits, regardless of their gender, background, or profession.",
            "In my understanding, the move to decriminalize marijuana has effectively downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. This shift has significant implications, particularly in job interviews and future opportunities, where a marijuana charge can have far-reaching consequences. While this decriminalization may alleviate some of the worst ramifications associated with a drug charge, the long-term effects on one's record can persist.\n\nHowever, there is another side to the argument. The costs associated with arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses can be substantial. From law enforcement expenses to court proceedings and public defenders, the financial burden on municipalities can be considerable. In some cases, these costs can be a significant factor in a community's decision-making process, particularly when they are struggling financially.\n\nDenver serves as an interesting example, as its relatively liberal attitude towards marijuana has allowed the city to redirect funds towards more pressing issues, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless. By decriminalizing marijuana, Denver has been able to allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nWhile it's true that complete legalization of marijuana could have its drawbacks, such as increased public consumption and potential coordination with driving, it's also essential to acknowledge the nuances of individual reactions to the substance. Research has shown that people respond differently to marijuana, and some may be more susceptible to its adverse effects than others. Personalities, moderation, and individual circumstances all play a significant role in determining how one interacts with marijuana.\n\nUltimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. It's crucial to recognize that people's experiences with substances are unique, and a more thoughtful approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding marijuana use.",
            "My stance on this issue is yes, albeit with certain reservations. While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships. My own family's experience illustrates this point; my parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in a Catholic ceremony due to their differing faiths.\n\nThis dichotomy between doctrine and practice is a significant issue within the Catholic Church. While the Church's teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and love, its rigid adherence to tradition often undermines these values. This has led me to question the effectiveness of certain Church practices and policies.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marital status, it's essential to separate the potential benefits of allowing priests to marry from the underlying causes of clergy misconduct. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could help prevent certain behaviors, I believe that such actions are often driven by deeper psychological issues. Ultimately, the relationship between marriage and clergy misconduct is complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the value of tradition, I also believe that the Catholic Church must re-examine its practices and policies to ensure they align with its core teachings. By doing so, the Church can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment that truly reflects its values.",
            "The issue at hand is a complex one, and I am still in the process of forming a well-rounded opinion. Both sides of the debate present valid arguments, making it challenging to definitively declare a winner. One of the primary difficulties lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state. The concept of marriage, particularly in its definition, raises questions about the role of government intervention.\n\nWhile many view marriage as a sacrament, others see it as a civil union, which has significant implications for taxation and government recognition. For instance, individuals who have been baptized may receive certain benefits. I believe that the government should consider marriage as a civil union, focusing on the union of two individuals rather than the specifics of the ceremony. This approach avoids entangling church and state, allowing individuals to define their union according to their personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, I believe that the primary concern should be the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, not the label attached to their union. In the event that all states can come to a mutually agreeable decision, a federal law would be a more practical solution than a constitutional amendment. However, altering the constitution to ban gay marriage would be an extreme measure, as it is a relatively minor issue compared to the weight and significance of constitutional amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and its definition requires careful consideration of the separation of church and state, individual rights, and the role of government intervention. A more nuanced approach would prioritize civil unions and the inherent value of all individuals, rather than focusing on specific labels or definitions.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has led me to develop a nuanced perspective on the issue of homosexuality. While I have close friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I don't necessarily align with the entire spectrum of the gay rights movement. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their personal lives, and therefore, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think the decision should be left to the federal government, as this is a matter of state-level politics. Each state has its unique cultural and social dynamics, and it's essential to respect the democratic process. In democratic states, the residents are likely to have already expressed their views on the issue through their elected representatives. Conversely, in more conservative states, the residents have also had a say in the decision-making process.\n\nI believe that individuals should be free to live their lives according to their own values and principles, and as such, they should have the same opportunities and rights as heterosexual individuals. This is why I think it's essential to let each state decide whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal government should not impose its will on the states, as this would undermine the principles of local governance.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced that the President's personal opinion on the matter should dictate the nation's stance. Given the limited time left in President Bush's term, it's likely that the issue will be revisited by future administrations. Rather than creating a national debate, it would be more practical to allow each state to handle the matter according to its own values and priorities.\n\nUltimately, this issue should be left to the discretion of each state, as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision. This approach respects the diversity of the nation and allows for a more inclusive and adaptive response to the complexities of modern society.",
            "When considering the intersection of online privacy and school safety, it's essential to acknowledge that online platforms like Myspace are inherently public spaces. By definition, posting content on such sites makes it accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. \n\nIn the case of a student posting potentially incriminating content online, it's reasonable for school officials to have access to that information, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school's name. The notion that officials can access this information from their personal residences is a reality, and it underscores the need for responsible online behavior among students.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring online activity raises concerns about privacy. While it's understandable that schools may want to ensure a safe environment, overstepping into the realm of monitoring students' personal online lives can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThis is a delicate balance, especially considering the potential consequences of not taking proactive measures to prevent incidents like school shootings. While it's true that school officials may have legitimate reasons for monitoring online activity, it's also essential to respect students' right to online privacy. \n\nIn some cases, school officials may use online monitoring as a means to identify potential issues and prevent them from escalating. For instance, if a student is posting about substance use or other concerning behavior, it's reasonable for officials to take note and address the situation. However, this approach must be carefully managed to avoid crossing the line into excessive monitoring.\n\nWhen discussing this topic with a former teacher, I was reminded of the importance of school safety drills and lockdown procedures. These measures are put in place to ensure the well-being of students in the event of an emergency, such as a school shooting. While the specific incident I'm referring to may seem unrelated, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context of school safety and the measures taken to prevent incidents.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials is to create a safe and supportive environment for students. While online monitoring can be a valuable tool in achieving this goal, it's crucial to strike a balance between safety and privacy. By being mindful of these considerations, we can work towards creating a more effective and responsible approach to school safety.",
            "My initial perspective on the war was shaped by the personal impact of 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation now, I realize that our entry into the conflict was likely premature and misguided. While the emotional response to the tragedy was understandable, it appears that we overlooked several crucial aspects and failed to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nOur forces were sent to the region without adequate preparation, and the nature of war in the target country is vastly different from what we experience. The local culture and methods of warfare are often brutal and driven by a desire for self-preservation, rather than a genuine interest in nation-building.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems that our primary motivation for going to war was a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The decision to invade Iraq was likely influenced by a mix of public sentiment and a perceived need for action following 9/11. While I understand the sentiment behind this decision, I now believe that it was a hasty and misguided one.\n\nLooking back, it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges we would face. A more measured approach, with a clear plan and a deeper understanding of the local culture, would have been more effective in the long run. Unfortunately, our impulsive response led to a situation that has been difficult to extricate ourselves from.\n\nThe reality is that the country we intervened in is unlikely to change its fundamental nature, and our attempts to impose our will on them have been counterproductive. In many ways, our presence has become a catalyst for further division and conflict, rather than a force for stability.\n\nWhile we have made some progress, it's clear that our presence is no longer tenable. The fact is that we can't stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued involvement is only serving to perpetuate a cycle of violence and instability. It's time for us to acknowledge that our intervention has not achieved its intended goals and to begin planning for a responsible exit strategy."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on certain issues in order to prevent a decline in its followers. One of the primary reasons for this decline, as noted by various discussions, is the Church's perceived inflexibility in accepting modern values and perspectives. Specifically, its strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control may be contributing to a growing divide between the Church and its adherents. \n\nWhile the Church's convictions on these matters are understandable, they may seem outdated to some. By adjusting its stance to reflect a more contemporary outlook, the Church may be able to mitigate the loss of its following. Observers have noted that some individuals are beginning to disaffiliate with the Church due to disagreements over these issues, indicating a widening gap between the Church's views and those of its members. \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights may feel uncomfortable within a community that views the practice as morally reprehensible. Similarly, those who advocate for gay marriage may not feel welcome in a Church that does not recognize their union. The Church's stance on these matters can create a sense of dissonance and potentially drive individuals away. \n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is also a point of contention. While it is unclear whether allowing priests to be married or ordaining women as priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have fostered a more accepting environment. The Church's doctrine views priests as married to God, but this does not preclude the possibility of priests having a personal life outside of their faith. Many professionals lead dual lives, balancing their work and personal responsibilities. There is no apparent reason why priests should be held to a different standard. \n\nBy reevaluating its stance on these issues, the Catholic Church may be able to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that aligns with the values of its followers. This, in turn, could help prevent the continued decline in its following and foster a more harmonious relationship between the Church and its adherents.",
            "While I, personally, have not taken a strong stance on the matter, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. The concept of same-sex marriage is a topic that has sparked much debate, and I think it's essential to approach it with an open mind.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that sexual orientation does not seem to be a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it's unfair to hold them responsible for something that is an inherent aspect of who they are.\n\nFrom my perspective, it appears that the government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted. This is not a matter of national security or moral concerns but rather a personal aspect of an individual's life. It's essential to respect people's choices and identities, and the government should not overstep its bounds by imposing its views.\n\nIn my opinion, the government should not dictate how individuals choose to live their lives. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and it's essential to respect that. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or retribution. This includes those who identify as gay or LGBTQ+, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and respect their rights.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is an issue that warrants serious consideration. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions about the nature of homosexual relationships. However, a closer examination reveals that these relationships are not fundamentally different from heterosexual ones. In fact, research suggests that gay couples exhibit similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding gay marriage is the potential impact on the institution of marriage itself. However, this concern is misguided, as gay couples are not seeking to redefine marriage in a religious context, but rather to obtain a legal recognition of their relationship through a civil marriage certificate. This distinction is crucial, as it separates the issue from religious doctrine and focuses on the legal and social implications.\n\nThe notion that gay marriage poses a threat to traditional family values is also an oversimplification. In reality, the structure and roles within gay relationships are diverse and varied, much like those in heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, the argument that gay couples are not suitable parents due to their sexual orientation is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, research suggests that children raised by gay parents are no more likely to experience difficulties than those raised by heterosexual parents.\n\nThe treatment of children of gay parents in schools is a particularly disturbing aspect of this issue. The existence of special schools for children of gay parents in cities like New York highlights the need for greater acceptance and understanding. Rather than stigmatizing these children, we should focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nThe federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. By making gay marriage legal nationwide, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated equally under the law. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only morally reprehensible but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nLastly, it is essential to acknowledge the harm caused by perpetuating myths about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or the result of childhood trauma. By ignoring scientific evidence and instead relying on anecdotal opinions and popular culture, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a matter of human dignity and equality. By recognizing the similarities between gay and heterosexual relationships and promoting a culture of acceptance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
            "One of the key aspects of my experience working in a hospital pharmacy is the nuanced understanding of the relationship between a substance's legal status and its therapeutic value. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a drug does not necessarily negate its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I firmly believe that certain substances should not be accessible to the general public, their controlled use in a medical context is a different matter altogether. The fact that certain substances are restricted in their availability does not preclude their usefulness in a controlled environment. For instance, many pharmaceuticals that are classified as controlled substances, such as oxycodone and Vicodin, are regularly utilized in pharmacies due to their proven therapeutic benefits. This serves as a prime example of how the stigma surrounding a substance can hinder its acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is a complex issue. While it's true that excessive consumption of either substance can lead to negative consequences, I believe that it's crucial to separate the two in this context. The differing levels of social acceptance and regulation surrounding marijuana contribute to its often-misguided reputation. It's essential to reevaluate this stigma and consider the potential benefits of marijuana in a controlled environment.\n\nA more measured approach to addressing the issue of marijuana's illegality might be to first work on changing the public's perception of the substance. By doing so, individuals may be more inclined to use it responsibly, particularly in cases where it could be beneficial for medicinal purposes. I firmly believe that a more informed and open-minded approach to marijuana could lead to its more widespread acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.",
            "Over the past century, I've noticed a shift in the way the church adapts to the changing times. The once traditional Sunday masses have evolved into a more modern and casual setting. Gone are the days of donning elaborate outfits and picture-perfect appearances; today, people attend mass in jeans and khakis, reflecting the relaxed atmosphere that pervades the community. Families with young children often arrive fashionably late, adding to the casual vibe. This transformation has been particularly evident during summer masses, where beachwear is not uncommon.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I recall attending a private school on the weekends, where I would see friends and classmates every Sunday. The church became a hub for socializing and community building, rather than a strictly traditional gathering. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it easier for people to incorporate faith into their busy schedules.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I don't believe that allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented these incidents. While some might argue that marriage or a more inclusive clergy could have mitigated the problem, I firmly believe that the root of the issue lies in the individual's inherent nature. Research suggests that pedophilia may be linked to genetics, rather than environmental factors. This understanding is supported by studies that indicate a strong genetic component to the condition.\n\nIn cases where clergy members have engaged in such behavior, it's essential to acknowledge that their actions are a result of their personal choices and not a result of their marital status or position within the church. If someone with a predisposition to pedophilia were to get married, it's unlikely that their behavior would change. In fact, their actions might remain hidden for a time, only to surface later. Therefore, I don't think that the church's policies on marriage or clergy composition would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone significant changes, its ability to prevent pedophilia is not directly related to its policies on marriage or clergy. Rather, it's essential to address the root causes of such behavior and hold individuals accountable for their actions. If the church is found to have knowingly covered up such incidents, it's unacceptable and deserves condemnation.",
            "While the initial premise may have sparked some initial acceptance, I believe the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks created a complex geopolitical climate that contributed to the US decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration's assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved false, has been a contentious issue that continues to weigh heavily on my conscience. This deception, coupled with the administration's apparent disregard for the truth, has raised serious concerns about the erosion of the US's constitutional framework.\n\nThe revelation that Colin Powell, then-US Secretary of State, expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the UN, underscores the gravity of the situation. The notion that the administration prioritized its agenda over the well-being of the American people is a notion that has left a lasting impression. Furthermore, the perception that the Bush administration sought to circumvent the Constitution, often under the guise of national security, has only served to exacerbate these concerns.\n\nThe notion that the US invaded Iraq with the intention of expanding its energy interests, as alleged by a former high-ranking official, has further fueled my skepticism about the motivations behind the war. The consequences of this decision have been far-reaching, with the country teetering on the brink of chaos and the potential for civil war.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, the proposed solution of a coalition-led intervention, comprising nations from the surrounding region, has its own set of challenges. The risk of undermining Iraq's sovereignty, already a pressing concern, is a significant one. The difficulties in establishing a stable and effective government, as evident from the current state of the Iraqi Parliament, only serve to highlight the complexity of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I remain uncertain about the long-term implications of the invasion, and the continued involvement of the US in Iraq's affairs. While I can appreciate the need for a solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is required to address the multifaceted challenges facing the region.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the nuances of a situation that has garnered significant attention globally. Initially, I had reservations about the conflict, viewing it as a response to the 9/11 attacks rather than a declared war. As I delved deeper, I began to consider the underlying motivations behind the U.S. presence in Iraq. It appears that the primary goal was to establish a democratic government, mirroring the American system, and secure access to Iraqi oil reserves. However, this approach has been met with resistance, and the conflict has become increasingly contentious.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for cultural insensitivity and the risk of imposing Western values on an alien culture. The longer we remain in Iraq, the more we risk exacerbating existing tensions and potentially creating more enemies. The Al-Qaeda issue is a significant factor, as our attempts to impose democracy may be perceived as a form of cultural imperialism, fueling further hatred towards the U.S.\n\nMoreover, the war has had a profound impact on the people of Iraq, leaving many without basic necessities like education and safety. The presence of various factions vying for power has created a complex and volatile environment, making it challenging to establish a stable government. The ongoing conflict raises questions about the effectiveness of our military strategy and the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nWhile it's difficult to provide a clear-cut solution, I believe that a more measured approach is necessary. We must consider the potential consequences of our actions and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the situation. It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of the conflict and the diverse perspectives involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the War in Iraq are shaped by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that a more thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach is necessary to address the complexities of this situation.",
            "The notion that the government should have the authority to declare certain religious practices legal or illegal strikes me as problematic. The concept of separation of church and state, enshrined in the constitution, implies that such decisions should be left to the churches themselves. This separation serves as a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to hold diverse beliefs without fear of persecution.\n\nEfforts to introduce legislation or amendments that could restrict certain religious practices seem counterintuitive, given the principles of the constitution. In fact, such an amendment would be a departure from the fundamental principles of the document. Moreover, it could be argued that such a move would be an unusual instance of government overreach, as it would impose restrictions on the people rather than the government.\n\nThe motivations behind such an amendment are also cause for concern. If the primary driving force is a personal preference for a particular faith, it raises questions about the impartiality of the government in making decisions that affect the religious freedoms of all citizens. By doing so, it could be perceived as favoring one religion over others.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the impact of such an amendment is unclear, but it's possible that it could have unforeseen benefits on society. However, this seems a tenuous argument for restricting religious freedoms.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what practices are acceptable or not should be left to the churches, as they are best equipped to make informed decisions about the values and principles of their respective faiths. The government's role is to ensure that these decisions do not infringe on the rights of others, not to impose its own will on the people.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of US Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and one that I believe was marred by a lack of transparency and foresight on the part of the US government. The administration's narrative linking the 9/11 attacks to Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities was misleading, and it capitalized on the American people's outrage and fear to justify the invasion.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I was particularly concerned about the preemptive strike on Iraq. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam conflict are striking, with both instances involving a foreign government imposing its will on a sovereign nation, often with disastrous consequences. The US government's failure to learn from past mistakes is a troubling aspect of its decision-making process.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been staggering, with countless American lives lost and a protracted occupation that has shown no signs of resolution. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime created a power vacuum, which the US government was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath was marked by chaos, sectarian violence, and a protracted insurgency that has left the Iraqi people traumatized.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that the US government underestimated the complexities of nation-building and the difficulty of establishing a stable democracy in a war-torn country. The experience in Iraq serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of military intervention and the importance of thorough planning and consideration of long-term consequences.\n\nThe war in Iraq also raises questions about the motivations behind US foreign policy. The pursuit of oil and strategic interests has often been cited as a primary driver of US foreign policy, and the Iraq War is no exception. The lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the decision to invade has contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue that involved a range of factors, including politics, economics, and ideology. While it is difficult to predict the future, I hope that the US government will learn from the lessons of Iraq and approach future conflicts with a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to grapple with, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, as I reflect on the war, I am struck by the human cost and the sense of moral obligation that comes with intervening in a foreign country. The question of when to intervene and how to do so in a way that minimizes harm is a critical one that requires careful consideration and a commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the Iraq War serves as a reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of international relations and the importance of critically evaluating the motivations and actions of those in power.",
            "When considering the issue of gay marriage, I firmly believe that it is a matter of personal preference, one that has been increasingly linked to biological factors rather than sociological influences. Research suggests that there may be a genetic component to sexual orientation, which raises questions about the legitimacy of denying rights to individuals based on something that is largely beyond their control.\n\nThe idea that government and politics should play a role in this matter seems not only misguided but also inhumane. Marriage is a deeply personal and private affair, one that should be left to individuals to decide for themselves, without the interference of external entities. I've witnessed firsthand the loving relationships between gay couples in my community, who live and contribute to society just like any other family.\n\nThe notion that certain groups or individuals can dictate the definition of marriage is not only absurd but also an attempt to impose their will on others. In this case, I believe President Bush's stance on the matter is particularly problematic, as it seeks to reinterpret the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda.\n\nStudies have shown that there may be a chemical component to sexual orientation, which is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This suggests that being gay is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of one's identity. In light of this, it's hard to understand why gay couples are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the most striking disparities in this issue is the double standard that exists. When a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so in private, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a public spectacle, with the media and government scrutinizing every aspect of their relationship. This highlights the need for a more private and personal approach to marriage, one that respects the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices.\n\nOverall, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and equality, and that government and politics should not interfere with the rights of individuals to love and commit to one another.",
            "When something is posted online, it becomes public domain, available for anyone to see. As an RA, I've encountered instances where this has become a pressing concern. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information, especially when it comes to discussions about violent or disturbing topics. The internet's vast reach means that even seemingly private conversations can be accessed by a wide audience, including schools and law enforcement.\n\nIn our school, a recent incident highlighted the importance of this issue. A student shared some concerning comments online, which were later reported to the authorities. It's crucial to acknowledge that online statements, no matter how lighthearted they may seem, can be misinterpreted or taken seriously in the wrong context. This can lead to serious consequences, as in the case of the incident mentioned earlier.\n\nThe power dynamics between students and school officials are also worth examining. While it's understandable that students may not want their personal lives monitored, it's also true that school administrators have a responsibility to act on concerns that may indicate potential threats to student safety. However, this should be done in a way that respects student boundaries and doesn't involve unwarranted surveillance.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to strike a balance between free speech and responsibility. As an RA, I believe it's crucial to educate students about the potential consequences of their online actions and to encourage them to think critically about what they share online. This includes being mindful of their online presence and the potential impact it may have on their relationships and reputation.\n\nBy being aware of these complexities, we can work towards creating a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone involved.",
            "It's been a prolonged and seemingly inconclusive conflict, with its original objectives losing clarity over time. Initially, the goal was to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair government. While that objective is commendable, it's possible that personal animosities between key figures, such as the pre-existing tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAs the war has dragged on, it's become increasingly difficult to discern a clear purpose. The initial phases of the conflict, however, did serve as a powerful statement in support of democracy. Unfortunately, the prolonged nature of the war has compromised its original objectives and led to a loss of focus.\n\nOne could argue that the war's continuation stems from a desire to assert global dominance rather than a genuine commitment to promoting democracy. It's worth considering whether the initial motivations were truly altruistic or if they were driven by less noble intentions.\n\nGiven the immense financial and human costs, it's reasonable to question the war's continued relevance. The funds spent on this conflict could be better utilized to address pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. The fact that we're diverting resources away from our own nation's needs and toward a foreign conflict is a pressing concern.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's imperative to reassess our priorities and reevaluate the war's purpose. It's time for a decisive conclusion, allowing the affected nation to assume responsibility for its own governance and for us to redirect our resources toward more pressing domestic challenges.",
            "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences. This can make it challenging to determine who is genuinely interested in connecting with me and who might be seeking to exploit this information.\n\nIn my own case, I try to strike a balance between sharing enough information to connect with friends and keeping certain details private. However, it's difficult to know exactly what information is being shared and with whom, especially when interacting with people I don't know.\n\nA recent news story about someone using social media to gather information about a young girl and manipulate her highlights the potential risks of online interactions. While I wouldn't engage with someone who I didn't know online, I have experienced instances where people I don't recognize have contacted me through instant messaging, which raises concerns about their intentions.\n\nI also recall a situation where my roommate's high school had banned students from using Myspace, which led to a discussion about the school's authority in this matter. While I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, it did raise questions about the school's right to dictate what students can and cannot do online.\n\nThese are some of the thoughts that come to mind when considering the intersection of social media, privacy, and safety.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered widespread international condemnation. While it's natural to approach this topic with a sense of trepidation, considering the numerous polls and surveys that have been conducted on the matter, it's worth examining the broader context in which the war was initiated.\n\nAccording to various polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, a significant majority of the population – roughly 75 to 80% – views the war as a misstep. Within Iraq, a significant portion of the population shares this sentiment, with 80% advocating for a swift withdrawal. Similarly, a substantial number of US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, believe that the war was a misguided decision and that a withdrawal within a year would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe war's outcome has been widely regarded as a disaster, with many arguing that it was already a catastrophe before the US involvement. The attempt to impose democracy on a region with fundamentally different cultural values has been met with skepticism, and the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states appears insurmountable.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam Hussein was a troublesome leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of invasion before embarking on such a significant endeavor. The consequences of invading a country can be far-reaching and devastating, as seen in the case of Iraq.\n\nGiven the overwhelming international and regional support for a swift withdrawal, it's puzzling that the US administration continues to justify extended involvement. While it's understandable that they may be concerned about the potential consequences of a hasty exit, it's difficult to identify a compelling reason to maintain the current status quo.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a more palatable option, but the underlying question remains: why should the US continue to occupy Iraq? The Iraqi people, whom we aim to assist and protect, are clearly signaling that they want us to leave, and it's worth considering their perspective. By heeding their advice, we may be able to avoid further entanglement in a complex and intractable conflict.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to acknowledge the limits of our influence in the Middle East and to recognize that our actions will never be perceived as altruistic. However, by withdrawing from Iraq, we may be able to mitigate the damage and create a more favorable environment for future engagement.",
            "While societal progress has been made, I firmly believe that gender discrimination still persists in the United States. This issue extends beyond women, as it is deeply intertwined with the specific field or workplace in question. For instance, women often face significant challenges in the business world due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even with equal qualifications, they may struggle to advance to leadership positions. This stems from a long-standing societal bias, where men are often seen as the dominant force in the corporate world.\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in upper-management roles, leading to a reluctance to promote them to key positions. Conversely, men in non-traditional professions, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face prejudice due to societal expectations that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance, as some individuals view men in these roles as deviating from traditional norms.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender-based biases are evident. Men who pursue careers in fashion may be dismissed due to preconceived notions about their masculinity or style. This can lead to a lack of credibility, with some individuals questioning whether men in the fashion industry truly understand the needs of their female clients. However, as more men enter the field and share their perspectives, attitudes are beginning to shift.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. Rather than forcing change, it's necessary to create a gradual shift in societal attitudes. This can be achieved by showcasing the accomplishments and contributions of underrepresented groups, without being overly aggressive or pushy.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It's crucial to recognize that individuals can be discriminated against based on various factors, including their background, education, or even their accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged based on their grammar rather than their intelligence or capabilities.\n\nUltimately, overcoming these biases will require a continued effort to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can work towards a more equitable society where individuals are judged on their merits, regardless of their gender, background, or profession.",
            "In my understanding, the move to decriminalize marijuana has effectively downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. This shift has significant implications, particularly in job interviews and future opportunities, where a marijuana charge can have far-reaching consequences. While this decriminalization may alleviate some of the worst ramifications associated with a drug charge, the long-term effects on one's record can persist.\n\nHowever, there is another side to the argument. The costs associated with arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses can be substantial. From law enforcement expenses to court proceedings and public defenders, the financial burden on municipalities can be considerable. In some cases, these costs can be a significant factor in a community's decision-making process, particularly when they are struggling financially.\n\nDenver serves as an interesting example, as its relatively liberal attitude towards marijuana has allowed the city to redirect funds towards more pressing issues, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless. By decriminalizing marijuana, Denver has been able to allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nWhile it's true that complete legalization of marijuana could have its drawbacks, such as increased public consumption and potential coordination with driving, it's also essential to acknowledge the nuances of individual reactions to the substance. Research has shown that people respond differently to marijuana, and some may be more susceptible to its adverse effects than others. Personalities, moderation, and individual circumstances all play a significant role in determining how one interacts with marijuana.\n\nUltimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. It's crucial to recognize that people's experiences with substances are unique, and a more thoughtful approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding marijuana use.",
            "My stance on this issue is yes, albeit with certain reservations. While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships. My own family's experience illustrates this point; my parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in a Catholic ceremony due to their differing faiths.\n\nThis dichotomy between doctrine and practice is a significant issue within the Catholic Church. While the Church's teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and love, its rigid adherence to tradition often undermines these values. This has led me to question the effectiveness of certain Church practices and policies.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marital status, it's essential to separate the potential benefits of allowing priests to marry from the underlying causes of clergy misconduct. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could help prevent certain behaviors, I believe that such actions are often driven by deeper psychological issues. Ultimately, the relationship between marriage and clergy misconduct is complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the value of tradition, I also believe that the Catholic Church must re-examine its practices and policies to ensure they align with its core teachings. By doing so, the Church can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment that truly reflects its values.",
            "The issue at hand is a complex one, and I am still in the process of forming a well-rounded opinion. Both sides of the debate present valid arguments, making it challenging to definitively declare a winner. One of the primary difficulties lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state. The concept of marriage, particularly in its definition, raises questions about the role of government intervention.\n\nWhile many view marriage as a sacrament, others see it as a civil union, which has significant implications for taxation and government recognition. For instance, individuals who have been baptized may receive certain benefits. I believe that the government should consider marriage as a civil union, focusing on the union of two individuals rather than the specifics of the ceremony. This approach avoids entangling church and state, allowing individuals to define their union according to their personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, I believe that the primary concern should be the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, not the label attached to their union. In the event that all states can come to a mutually agreeable decision, a federal law would be a more practical solution than a constitutional amendment. However, altering the constitution to ban gay marriage would be an extreme measure, as it is a relatively minor issue compared to the weight and significance of constitutional amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and its definition requires careful consideration of the separation of church and state, individual rights, and the role of government intervention. A more nuanced approach would prioritize civil unions and the inherent value of all individuals, rather than focusing on specific labels or definitions.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has led me to develop a nuanced perspective on the issue of homosexuality. While I have close friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I don't necessarily align with the entire spectrum of the gay rights movement. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their personal lives, and therefore, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think the decision should be left to the federal government, as this is a matter of state-level politics. Each state has its unique cultural and social dynamics, and it's essential to respect the democratic process. In democratic states, the residents are likely to have already expressed their views on the issue through their elected representatives. Conversely, in more conservative states, the residents have also had a say in the decision-making process.\n\nI believe that individuals should be free to live their lives according to their own values and principles, and as such, they should have the same opportunities and rights as heterosexual individuals. This is why I think it's essential to let each state decide whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal government should not impose its will on the states, as this would undermine the principles of local governance.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced that the President's personal opinion on the matter should dictate the nation's stance. Given the limited time left in President Bush's term, it's likely that the issue will be revisited by future administrations. Rather than creating a national debate, it would be more practical to allow each state to handle the matter according to its own values and priorities.\n\nUltimately, this issue should be left to the discretion of each state, as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision. This approach respects the diversity of the nation and allows for a more inclusive and adaptive response to the complexities of modern society.",
            "When considering the intersection of online privacy and school safety, it's essential to acknowledge that online platforms like Myspace are inherently public spaces. By definition, posting content on such sites makes it accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. \n\nIn the case of a student posting potentially incriminating content online, it's reasonable for school officials to have access to that information, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school's name. The notion that officials can access this information from their personal residences is a reality, and it underscores the need for responsible online behavior among students.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring online activity raises concerns about privacy. While it's understandable that schools may want to ensure a safe environment, overstepping into the realm of monitoring students' personal online lives can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThis is a delicate balance, especially considering the potential consequences of not taking proactive measures to prevent incidents like school shootings. While it's true that school officials may have legitimate reasons for monitoring online activity, it's also essential to respect students' right to online privacy. \n\nIn some cases, school officials may use online monitoring as a means to identify potential issues and prevent them from escalating. For instance, if a student is posting about substance use or other concerning behavior, it's reasonable for officials to take note and address the situation. However, this approach must be carefully managed to avoid crossing the line into excessive monitoring.\n\nWhen discussing this topic with a former teacher, I was reminded of the importance of school safety drills and lockdown procedures. These measures are put in place to ensure the well-being of students in the event of an emergency, such as a school shooting. While the specific incident I'm referring to may seem unrelated, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context of school safety and the measures taken to prevent incidents.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials is to create a safe and supportive environment for students. While online monitoring can be a valuable tool in achieving this goal, it's crucial to strike a balance between safety and privacy. By being mindful of these considerations, we can work towards creating a more effective and responsible approach to school safety.",
            "My initial perspective on the war was shaped by the personal impact of 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation now, I realize that our entry into the conflict was likely premature and misguided. While the emotional response to the tragedy was understandable, it appears that we overlooked several crucial aspects and failed to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nOur forces were sent to the region without adequate preparation, and the nature of war in the target country is vastly different from what we experience. The local culture and methods of warfare are often brutal and driven by a desire for self-preservation, rather than a genuine interest in nation-building.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems that our primary motivation for going to war was a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The decision to invade Iraq was likely influenced by a mix of public sentiment and a perceived need for action following 9/11. While I understand the sentiment behind this decision, I now believe that it was a hasty and misguided one.\n\nLooking back, it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges we would face. A more measured approach, with a clear plan and a deeper understanding of the local culture, would have been more effective in the long run. Unfortunately, our impulsive response led to a situation that has been difficult to extricate ourselves from.\n\nThe reality is that the country we intervened in is unlikely to change its fundamental nature, and our attempts to impose our will on them have been counterproductive. In many ways, our presence has become a catalyst for further division and conflict, rather than a force for stability.\n\nWhile we have made some progress, it's clear that our presence is no longer tenable. The fact is that we can't stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued involvement is only serving to perpetuate a cycle of violence and instability. It's time for us to acknowledge that our intervention has not achieved its intended goals and to begin planning for a responsible exit strategy."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church may need to reassess its stance on certain issues in order to prevent a decline in its followers. One of the primary reasons for this decline, as noted by various discussions, is the Church's perceived inflexibility in accepting modern values and perspectives. Specifically, its strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control may be contributing to a growing divide between the Church and its adherents. \n\nWhile the Church's convictions on these matters are understandable, they may seem outdated to some. By adjusting its stance to reflect a more contemporary outlook, the Church may be able to mitigate the loss of its following. Observers have noted that some individuals are beginning to disaffiliate with the Church due to disagreements over these issues, indicating a widening gap between the Church's views and those of its members. \n\nFor instance, individuals who support abortion rights may feel uncomfortable within a community that views the practice as morally reprehensible. Similarly, those who advocate for gay marriage may not feel welcome in a Church that does not recognize their union. The Church's stance on these matters can create a sense of dissonance and potentially drive individuals away. \n\nThe Church's stance on female priests and married clergy is also a point of contention. While it is unclear whether allowing priests to be married or ordaining women as priests would have prevented past controversies, it is possible that a more inclusive approach could have fostered a more accepting environment. The Church's doctrine views priests as married to God, but this does not preclude the possibility of priests having a personal life outside of their faith. Many professionals lead dual lives, balancing their work and personal responsibilities. There is no apparent reason why priests should be held to a different standard. \n\nBy reevaluating its stance on these issues, the Catholic Church may be able to create a more inclusive and welcoming environment that aligns with the values of its followers. This, in turn, could help prevent the continued decline in its following and foster a more harmonious relationship between the Church and its adherents.",
            "While I, personally, have not taken a strong stance on the matter, I believe that individuals should not be judged or held accountable for their sexual orientation. The concept of same-sex marriage is a topic that has sparked much debate, and I think it's essential to approach it with an open mind.\n\nUpon reflection, I've come to the realization that sexual orientation does not seem to be a choice. People are born with their inherent characteristics, and it's unfair to hold them responsible for something that is an inherent aspect of who they are.\n\nFrom my perspective, it appears that the government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted. This is not a matter of national security or moral concerns but rather a personal aspect of an individual's life. It's essential to respect people's choices and identities, and the government should not overstep its bounds by imposing its views.\n\nIn my opinion, the government should not dictate how individuals choose to live their lives. Everyone has the right to their own identity, and it's essential to respect that. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nUltimately, I believe that individuals should be free to live their lives as they see fit, without fear of judgment or retribution. This includes those who identify as gay or LGBTQ+, and it's crucial that we acknowledge and respect their rights.",
            "The legalization of gay marriage is an issue that warrants serious consideration. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions about the nature of homosexual relationships. However, a closer examination reveals that these relationships are not fundamentally different from heterosexual ones. In fact, research suggests that gay couples exhibit similar relationship dynamics and satisfaction rates as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the key concerns surrounding gay marriage is the potential impact on the institution of marriage itself. However, this concern is misguided, as gay couples are not seeking to redefine marriage in a religious context, but rather to obtain a legal recognition of their relationship through a civil marriage certificate. This distinction is crucial, as it separates the issue from religious doctrine and focuses on the legal and social implications.\n\nThe notion that gay marriage poses a threat to traditional family values is also an oversimplification. In reality, the structure and roles within gay relationships are diverse and varied, much like those in heterosexual relationships. Furthermore, the argument that gay couples are not suitable parents due to their sexual orientation is not supported by scientific evidence. In fact, research suggests that children raised by gay parents are no more likely to experience difficulties than those raised by heterosexual parents.\n\nThe treatment of children of gay parents in schools is a particularly disturbing aspect of this issue. The existence of special schools for children of gay parents in cities like New York highlights the need for greater acceptance and understanding. Rather than stigmatizing these children, we should focus on promoting a culture of inclusivity and respect.\n\nThe federal government has a crucial role to play in addressing this issue. By making gay marriage legal nationwide, the government can ensure that all citizens are treated equally under the law. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only morally reprehensible but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"under God\" clause in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nLastly, it is essential to acknowledge the harm caused by perpetuating myths about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked the notion that gay people are psychologically damaged or the result of childhood trauma. By ignoring scientific evidence and instead relying on anecdotal opinions and popular culture, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of gay marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a matter of human dignity and equality. By recognizing the similarities between gay and heterosexual relationships and promoting a culture of acceptance, we can work towards a more inclusive and compassionate society.",
            "One of the key aspects of my experience working in a hospital pharmacy is the nuanced understanding of the relationship between a substance's legal status and its therapeutic value. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a drug does not necessarily negate its potential benefits.\n\nWhile I firmly believe that certain substances should not be accessible to the general public, their controlled use in a medical context is a different matter altogether. The fact that certain substances are restricted in their availability does not preclude their usefulness in a controlled environment. For instance, many pharmaceuticals that are classified as controlled substances, such as oxycodone and Vicodin, are regularly utilized in pharmacies due to their proven therapeutic benefits. This serves as a prime example of how the stigma surrounding a substance can hinder its acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.\n\nComparing marijuana to alcohol is a complex issue. While it's true that excessive consumption of either substance can lead to negative consequences, I believe that it's crucial to separate the two in this context. The differing levels of social acceptance and regulation surrounding marijuana contribute to its often-misguided reputation. It's essential to reevaluate this stigma and consider the potential benefits of marijuana in a controlled environment.\n\nA more measured approach to addressing the issue of marijuana's illegality might be to first work on changing the public's perception of the substance. By doing so, individuals may be more inclined to use it responsibly, particularly in cases where it could be beneficial for medicinal purposes. I firmly believe that a more informed and open-minded approach to marijuana could lead to its more widespread acceptance as a legitimate treatment option.",
            "Over the past century, I've noticed a shift in the way the church adapts to the changing times. The once traditional Sunday masses have evolved into a more modern and casual setting. Gone are the days of donning elaborate outfits and picture-perfect appearances; today, people attend mass in jeans and khakis, reflecting the relaxed atmosphere that pervades the community. Families with young children often arrive fashionably late, adding to the casual vibe. This transformation has been particularly evident during summer masses, where beachwear is not uncommon.\n\nAs I reflect on my own experiences, I recall attending a private school on the weekends, where I would see friends and classmates every Sunday. The church became a hub for socializing and community building, rather than a strictly traditional gathering. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it easier for people to incorporate faith into their busy schedules.\n\nRegarding the recent allegations of pedophilia within the Catholic Church, I don't believe that allowing married priests or female priests would have prevented these incidents. While some might argue that marriage or a more inclusive clergy could have mitigated the problem, I firmly believe that the root of the issue lies in the individual's inherent nature. Research suggests that pedophilia may be linked to genetics, rather than environmental factors. This understanding is supported by studies that indicate a strong genetic component to the condition.\n\nIn cases where clergy members have engaged in such behavior, it's essential to acknowledge that their actions are a result of their personal choices and not a result of their marital status or position within the church. If someone with a predisposition to pedophilia were to get married, it's unlikely that their behavior would change. In fact, their actions might remain hidden for a time, only to surface later. Therefore, I don't think that the church's policies on marriage or clergy composition would have made a significant difference in preventing these incidents.\n\nIn conclusion, while the church has undergone significant changes, its ability to prevent pedophilia is not directly related to its policies on marriage or clergy. Rather, it's essential to address the root causes of such behavior and hold individuals accountable for their actions. If the church is found to have knowingly covered up such incidents, it's unacceptable and deserves condemnation.",
            "While the initial premise may have sparked some initial acceptance, I believe the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks created a complex geopolitical climate that contributed to the US decision to invade Iraq. The Bush administration's assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, which ultimately proved false, has been a contentious issue that continues to weigh heavily on my conscience. This deception, coupled with the administration's apparent disregard for the truth, has raised serious concerns about the erosion of the US's constitutional framework.\n\nThe revelation that Colin Powell, then-US Secretary of State, expressed doubts about the evidence presented at the UN, underscores the gravity of the situation. The notion that the administration prioritized its agenda over the well-being of the American people is a notion that has left a lasting impression. Furthermore, the perception that the Bush administration sought to circumvent the Constitution, often under the guise of national security, has only served to exacerbate these concerns.\n\nThe notion that the US invaded Iraq with the intention of expanding its energy interests, as alleged by a former high-ranking official, has further fueled my skepticism about the motivations behind the war. The consequences of this decision have been far-reaching, with the country teetering on the brink of chaos and the potential for civil war.\n\nIn the face of this uncertainty, the proposed solution of a coalition-led intervention, comprising nations from the surrounding region, has its own set of challenges. The risk of undermining Iraq's sovereignty, already a pressing concern, is a significant one. The difficulties in establishing a stable and effective government, as evident from the current state of the Iraqi Parliament, only serve to highlight the complexity of the situation.\n\nUltimately, I remain uncertain about the long-term implications of the invasion, and the continued involvement of the US in Iraq's affairs. While I can appreciate the need for a solution, I believe that a more nuanced approach is required to address the multifaceted challenges facing the region.",
            "My thoughts on the War in Iraq are complex and multifaceted, reflecting the nuances of a situation that has garnered significant attention globally. Initially, I had reservations about the conflict, viewing it as a response to the 9/11 attacks rather than a declared war. As I delved deeper, I began to consider the underlying motivations behind the U.S. presence in Iraq. It appears that the primary goal was to establish a democratic government, mirroring the American system, and secure access to Iraqi oil reserves. However, this approach has been met with resistance, and the conflict has become increasingly contentious.\n\nOne of the primary concerns is the potential for cultural insensitivity and the risk of imposing Western values on an alien culture. The longer we remain in Iraq, the more we risk exacerbating existing tensions and potentially creating more enemies. The Al-Qaeda issue is a significant factor, as our attempts to impose democracy may be perceived as a form of cultural imperialism, fueling further hatred towards the U.S.\n\nMoreover, the war has had a profound impact on the people of Iraq, leaving many without basic necessities like education and safety. The presence of various factions vying for power has created a complex and volatile environment, making it challenging to establish a stable government. The ongoing conflict raises questions about the effectiveness of our military strategy and the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nWhile it's difficult to provide a clear-cut solution, I believe that a more measured approach is necessary. We must consider the potential consequences of our actions and strive for a more nuanced understanding of the situation. It's essential to acknowledge the complexities of the conflict and the diverse perspectives involved.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the War in Iraq are shaped by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of the Iraqi people and the potential long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that a more thoughtful and culturally sensitive approach is necessary to address the complexities of this situation.",
            "The notion that the government should have the authority to declare certain religious practices legal or illegal strikes me as problematic. The concept of separation of church and state, enshrined in the constitution, implies that such decisions should be left to the churches themselves. This separation serves as a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to hold diverse beliefs without fear of persecution.\n\nEfforts to introduce legislation or amendments that could restrict certain religious practices seem counterintuitive, given the principles of the constitution. In fact, such an amendment would be a departure from the fundamental principles of the document. Moreover, it could be argued that such a move would be an unusual instance of government overreach, as it would impose restrictions on the people rather than the government.\n\nThe motivations behind such an amendment are also cause for concern. If the primary driving force is a personal preference for a particular faith, it raises questions about the impartiality of the government in making decisions that affect the religious freedoms of all citizens. By doing so, it could be perceived as favoring one religion over others.\n\nFrom an economic standpoint, the impact of such an amendment is unclear, but it's possible that it could have unforeseen benefits on society. However, this seems a tenuous argument for restricting religious freedoms.\n\nUltimately, the decision on what practices are acceptable or not should be left to the churches, as they are best equipped to make informed decisions about the values and principles of their respective faiths. The government's role is to ensure that these decisions do not infringe on the rights of others, not to impose its own will on the people.",
            "The Iraq War: A Critical Examination of US Policy\n\nThe invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a pivotal moment in modern history, and one that I believe was marred by a lack of transparency and foresight on the part of the US government. The administration's narrative linking the 9/11 attacks to Iraq's alleged WMD capabilities was misleading, and it capitalized on the American people's outrage and fear to justify the invasion.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, I was particularly concerned about the preemptive strike on Iraq. The parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam conflict are striking, with both instances involving a foreign government imposing its will on a sovereign nation, often with disastrous consequences. The US government's failure to learn from past mistakes is a troubling aspect of its decision-making process.\n\nThe human cost of the war has been staggering, with countless American lives lost and a protracted occupation that has shown no signs of resolution. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime created a power vacuum, which the US government was ill-prepared to fill. The aftermath was marked by chaos, sectarian violence, and a protracted insurgency that has left the Iraqi people traumatized.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that the US government underestimated the complexities of nation-building and the difficulty of establishing a stable democracy in a war-torn country. The experience in Iraq serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of military intervention and the importance of thorough planning and consideration of long-term consequences.\n\nThe war in Iraq also raises questions about the motivations behind US foreign policy. The pursuit of oil and strategic interests has often been cited as a primary driver of US foreign policy, and the Iraq War is no exception. The lack of accountability and transparency surrounding the decision to invade has contributed to a sense of disillusionment and mistrust among the American people.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War was a complex and multifaceted issue that involved a range of factors, including politics, economics, and ideology. While it is difficult to predict the future, I hope that the US government will learn from the lessons of Iraq and approach future conflicts with a more nuanced and thoughtful perspective.\n\nThis is not an easy issue to grapple with, and there are valid arguments on both sides. However, as I reflect on the war, I am struck by the human cost and the sense of moral obligation that comes with intervening in a foreign country. The question of when to intervene and how to do so in a way that minimizes harm is a critical one that requires careful consideration and a commitment to transparency and accountability.\n\nUltimately, the Iraq War serves as a reminder of the complexities and uncertainties of international relations and the importance of critically evaluating the motivations and actions of those in power.",
            "When considering the issue of gay marriage, I firmly believe that it is a matter of personal preference, one that has been increasingly linked to biological factors rather than sociological influences. Research suggests that there may be a genetic component to sexual orientation, which raises questions about the legitimacy of denying rights to individuals based on something that is largely beyond their control.\n\nThe idea that government and politics should play a role in this matter seems not only misguided but also inhumane. Marriage is a deeply personal and private affair, one that should be left to individuals to decide for themselves, without the interference of external entities. I've witnessed firsthand the loving relationships between gay couples in my community, who live and contribute to society just like any other family.\n\nThe notion that certain groups or individuals can dictate the definition of marriage is not only absurd but also an attempt to impose their will on others. In this case, I believe President Bush's stance on the matter is particularly problematic, as it seeks to reinterpret the concept of marriage to suit his own agenda.\n\nStudies have shown that there may be a chemical component to sexual orientation, which is shaped by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors. This suggests that being gay is not a choice, but rather an inherent aspect of one's identity. In light of this, it's hard to understand why gay couples are not afforded the same rights as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nOne of the most striking disparities in this issue is the double standard that exists. When a heterosexual couple wants to get married, they can do so in private, without drawing attention to themselves. However, if a gay couple wants to get married, it's suddenly a public spectacle, with the media and government scrutinizing every aspect of their relationship. This highlights the need for a more private and personal approach to marriage, one that respects the autonomy of individuals to make their own choices.\n\nOverall, I firmly believe that gay marriage is a matter of personal freedom and equality, and that government and politics should not interfere with the rights of individuals to love and commit to one another.",
            "When something is posted online, it becomes public domain, available for anyone to see. As an RA, I've encountered instances where this has become a pressing concern. It's essential to consider the potential consequences of sharing sensitive information, especially when it comes to discussions about violent or disturbing topics. The internet's vast reach means that even seemingly private conversations can be accessed by a wide audience, including schools and law enforcement.\n\nIn our school, a recent incident highlighted the importance of this issue. A student shared some concerning comments online, which were later reported to the authorities. It's crucial to acknowledge that online statements, no matter how lighthearted they may seem, can be misinterpreted or taken seriously in the wrong context. This can lead to serious consequences, as in the case of the incident mentioned earlier.\n\nThe power dynamics between students and school officials are also worth examining. While it's understandable that students may not want their personal lives monitored, it's also true that school administrators have a responsibility to act on concerns that may indicate potential threats to student safety. However, this should be done in a way that respects student boundaries and doesn't involve unwarranted surveillance.\n\nIn this context, it's essential to strike a balance between free speech and responsibility. As an RA, I believe it's crucial to educate students about the potential consequences of their online actions and to encourage them to think critically about what they share online. This includes being mindful of their online presence and the potential impact it may have on their relationships and reputation.\n\nBy being aware of these complexities, we can work towards creating a safer and more considerate online environment for everyone involved.",
            "It's been a prolonged and seemingly inconclusive conflict, with its original objectives losing clarity over time. Initially, the goal was to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair government. While that objective is commendable, it's possible that personal animosities between key figures, such as the pre-existing tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision-making process.\n\nAs the war has dragged on, it's become increasingly difficult to discern a clear purpose. The initial phases of the conflict, however, did serve as a powerful statement in support of democracy. Unfortunately, the prolonged nature of the war has compromised its original objectives and led to a loss of focus.\n\nOne could argue that the war's continuation stems from a desire to assert global dominance rather than a genuine commitment to promoting democracy. It's worth considering whether the initial motivations were truly altruistic or if they were driven by less noble intentions.\n\nGiven the immense financial and human costs, it's reasonable to question the war's continued relevance. The funds spent on this conflict could be better utilized to address pressing domestic issues, such as poverty, infrastructure development, and healthcare. The fact that we're diverting resources away from our own nation's needs and toward a foreign conflict is a pressing concern.\n\nIn light of these considerations, it's imperative to reassess our priorities and reevaluate the war's purpose. It's time for a decisive conclusion, allowing the affected nation to assume responsibility for its own governance and for us to redirect our resources toward more pressing domestic challenges.",
            "When considering the use of social media to prevent potential threats, one cannot help but wonder about the balance between personal privacy and public safety. If someone had discovered a concerning post on a social media site such as Myspace, it raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be monitored.\n\nIn theory, when individuals share information online, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. If you have a public profile on a site like Myspace, you've essentially granted permission to those you've accepted as friends to view your content. However, this doesn't necessarily justify the idea of having someone constantly monitoring students' profiles to prevent potential harm.\n\nThis situation becomes even more complex when considering the logistics of such a system. Having one person tasked with reviewing every student's profile would be impractical and potentially discriminatory, as it could lead to unfair scrutiny of certain individuals. It's also worth questioning whether such a measure would be effective or if it would simply be a waste of resources.\n\nIn reality, most people cannot and do not want to stay on top of every single online profile, and an individual randomly stumbling upon a concerning post is far more likely than a dedicated monitor. However, this does raise concerns about the potential for malicious individuals to use this information for their own purposes.\n\nAs someone who uses social media platforms like Facebook, I understand the importance of being cautious about what I share online. There are already concerns about people being able to access and misuse information about me, such as my contact information, schedule, and personal preferences. This can make it challenging to determine who is genuinely interested in connecting with me and who might be seeking to exploit this information.\n\nIn my own case, I try to strike a balance between sharing enough information to connect with friends and keeping certain details private. However, it's difficult to know exactly what information is being shared and with whom, especially when interacting with people I don't know.\n\nA recent news story about someone using social media to gather information about a young girl and manipulate her highlights the potential risks of online interactions. While I wouldn't engage with someone who I didn't know online, I have experienced instances where people I don't recognize have contacted me through instant messaging, which raises concerns about their intentions.\n\nI also recall a situation where my roommate's high school had banned students from using Myspace, which led to a discussion about the school's authority in this matter. While I'm not sure if it's a privacy issue, it did raise questions about the school's right to dictate what students can and cannot do online.\n\nThese are some of the thoughts that come to mind when considering the intersection of social media, privacy, and safety.",
            "The Iraq War is a complex and multifaceted issue that has garnered widespread international condemnation. While it's natural to approach this topic with a sense of trepidation, considering the numerous polls and surveys that have been conducted on the matter, it's worth examining the broader context in which the war was initiated.\n\nAccording to various polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and globally, a significant majority of the population – roughly 75 to 80% – views the war as a misstep. Within Iraq, a significant portion of the population shares this sentiment, with 80% advocating for a swift withdrawal. Similarly, a substantial number of US troops stationed in Iraq, approximately 70%, believe that the war was a misguided decision and that a withdrawal within a year would be the most appropriate course of action.\n\nThe war's outcome has been widely regarded as a disaster, with many arguing that it was already a catastrophe before the US involvement. The attempt to impose democracy on a region with fundamentally different cultural values has been met with skepticism, and the cultural gap between the US and Middle Eastern states appears insurmountable.\n\nWhile it's true that Saddam Hussein was a troublesome leader, it's essential to weigh the pros and cons of invasion before embarking on such a significant endeavor. The consequences of invading a country can be far-reaching and devastating, as seen in the case of Iraq.\n\nGiven the overwhelming international and regional support for a swift withdrawal, it's puzzling that the US administration continues to justify extended involvement. While it's understandable that they may be concerned about the potential consequences of a hasty exit, it's difficult to identify a compelling reason to maintain the current status quo.\n\nA gradual withdrawal over a period of a year or more might be a more palatable option, but the underlying question remains: why should the US continue to occupy Iraq? The Iraqi people, whom we aim to assist and protect, are clearly signaling that they want us to leave, and it's worth considering their perspective. By heeding their advice, we may be able to avoid further entanglement in a complex and intractable conflict.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to acknowledge the limits of our influence in the Middle East and to recognize that our actions will never be perceived as altruistic. However, by withdrawing from Iraq, we may be able to mitigate the damage and create a more favorable environment for future engagement.",
            "While societal progress has been made, I firmly believe that gender discrimination still persists in the United States. This issue extends beyond women, as it is deeply intertwined with the specific field or workplace in question. For instance, women often face significant challenges in the business world due to the \"glass ceiling,\" where even with equal qualifications, they may struggle to advance to leadership positions. This stems from a long-standing societal bias, where men are often seen as the dominant force in the corporate world.\n\nHistorically, women have been underrepresented in upper-management roles, leading to a reluctance to promote them to key positions. Conversely, men in non-traditional professions, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face prejudice due to societal expectations that men should be the primary breadwinners. This can lead to a lack of understanding and acceptance, as some individuals view men in these roles as deviating from traditional norms.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender-based biases are evident. Men who pursue careers in fashion may be dismissed due to preconceived notions about their masculinity or style. This can lead to a lack of credibility, with some individuals questioning whether men in the fashion industry truly understand the needs of their female clients. However, as more men enter the field and share their perspectives, attitudes are beginning to shift.\n\nTo address these issues, it's essential to promote understanding and acceptance by highlighting the qualities and strengths of individuals who are often stereotyped. Rather than forcing change, it's necessary to create a gradual shift in societal attitudes. This can be achieved by showcasing the accomplishments and contributions of underrepresented groups, without being overly aggressive or pushy.\n\nWhile progress has been made, there is still a long way to go. It's crucial to recognize that individuals can be discriminated against based on various factors, including their background, education, or even their accent. For instance, someone from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged based on their grammar rather than their intelligence or capabilities.\n\nUltimately, overcoming these biases will require a continued effort to promote understanding, acceptance, and inclusivity. By acknowledging and addressing these issues, we can work towards a more equitable society where individuals are judged on their merits, regardless of their gender, background, or profession.",
            "In my understanding, the move to decriminalize marijuana has effectively downgraded it from a serious offense to a more minor infraction, akin to a traffic citation. This shift has significant implications, particularly in job interviews and future opportunities, where a marijuana charge can have far-reaching consequences. While this decriminalization may alleviate some of the worst ramifications associated with a drug charge, the long-term effects on one's record can persist.\n\nHowever, there is another side to the argument. The costs associated with arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana offenses can be substantial. From law enforcement expenses to court proceedings and public defenders, the financial burden on municipalities can be considerable. In some cases, these costs can be a significant factor in a community's decision-making process, particularly when they are struggling financially.\n\nDenver serves as an interesting example, as its relatively liberal attitude towards marijuana has allowed the city to redirect funds towards more pressing issues, such as public education, social programs for the elderly, and food assistance for the homeless. By decriminalizing marijuana, Denver has been able to allocate resources more efficiently.\n\nWhile it's true that complete legalization of marijuana could have its drawbacks, such as increased public consumption and potential coordination with driving, it's also essential to acknowledge the nuances of individual reactions to the substance. Research has shown that people respond differently to marijuana, and some may be more susceptible to its adverse effects than others. Personalities, moderation, and individual circumstances all play a significant role in determining how one interacts with marijuana.\n\nUltimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their own set of problems, and it's challenging to make blanket statements about their effects. It's crucial to recognize that people's experiences with substances are unique, and a more thoughtful approach is necessary to address the complex issues surrounding marijuana use.",
            "My stance on this issue is yes, albeit with certain reservations. While traditional practices have their value, they must be balanced with adaptability and an openness to change. However, it's also crucial to acknowledge the challenges posed by adhering to outdated customs. One notable example of this is the Catholic Church's stance on attendance and doctrine. Many Catholics feel a strong obligation to attend church regularly, which can sometimes manifest as a rigid adherence to traditional practices and a lack of acceptance for those who don't conform.\n\nNotably, this attitude can be hypocritical, as the Church teaches the importance of love and acceptance, yet fails to practice what it preaches when it comes to interfaith relationships. My own family's experience illustrates this point; my parents, a Catholic and an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in a Catholic ceremony due to their differing faiths.\n\nThis dichotomy between doctrine and practice is a significant issue within the Catholic Church. While the Church's teachings emphasize the importance of compassion and love, its rigid adherence to tradition often undermines these values. This has led me to question the effectiveness of certain Church practices and policies.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marital status, it's essential to separate the potential benefits of allowing priests to marry from the underlying causes of clergy misconduct. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could help prevent certain behaviors, I believe that such actions are often driven by deeper psychological issues. Ultimately, the relationship between marriage and clergy misconduct is complex and multifaceted.\n\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge the value of tradition, I also believe that the Catholic Church must re-examine its practices and policies to ensure they align with its core teachings. By doing so, the Church can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment that truly reflects its values.",
            "The issue at hand is a complex one, and I am still in the process of forming a well-rounded opinion. Both sides of the debate present valid arguments, making it challenging to definitively declare a winner. One of the primary difficulties lies in the delicate balance between the separation of church and state. The concept of marriage, particularly in its definition, raises questions about the role of government intervention.\n\nWhile many view marriage as a sacrament, others see it as a civil union, which has significant implications for taxation and government recognition. For instance, individuals who have been baptized may receive certain benefits. I believe that the government should consider marriage as a civil union, focusing on the union of two individuals rather than the specifics of the ceremony. This approach avoids entangling church and state, allowing individuals to define their union according to their personal beliefs.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, I believe that the primary concern should be the inherent rights and dignity of all individuals, not the label attached to their union. In the event that all states can come to a mutually agreeable decision, a federal law would be a more practical solution than a constitutional amendment. However, altering the constitution to ban gay marriage would be an extreme measure, as it is a relatively minor issue compared to the weight and significance of constitutional amendments.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and its definition requires careful consideration of the separation of church and state, individual rights, and the role of government intervention. A more nuanced approach would prioritize civil unions and the inherent value of all individuals, rather than focusing on specific labels or definitions.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household has led me to develop a nuanced perspective on the issue of homosexuality. While I have close friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I don't necessarily align with the entire spectrum of the gay rights movement. However, I firmly believe that individuals should have the autonomy to make their own choices regarding their personal lives, and therefore, I support the legalization of same-sex marriage.\n\nI don't think the decision should be left to the federal government, as this is a matter of state-level politics. Each state has its unique cultural and social dynamics, and it's essential to respect the democratic process. In democratic states, the residents are likely to have already expressed their views on the issue through their elected representatives. Conversely, in more conservative states, the residents have also had a say in the decision-making process.\n\nI believe that individuals should be free to live their lives according to their own values and principles, and as such, they should have the same opportunities and rights as heterosexual individuals. This is why I think it's essential to let each state decide whether to legalize same-sex marriage. The federal government should not impose its will on the states, as this would undermine the principles of local governance.\n\nFurthermore, I'm not convinced that the President's personal opinion on the matter should dictate the nation's stance. Given the limited time left in President Bush's term, it's likely that the issue will be revisited by future administrations. Rather than creating a national debate, it would be more practical to allow each state to handle the matter according to its own values and priorities.\n\nUltimately, this issue should be left to the discretion of each state, as they are the ones who will be directly impacted by the decision. This approach respects the diversity of the nation and allows for a more inclusive and adaptive response to the complexities of modern society.",
            "When considering the intersection of online privacy and school safety, it's essential to acknowledge that online platforms like Myspace are inherently public spaces. By definition, posting content on such sites makes it accessible to a wide audience, including school officials. \n\nIn the case of a student posting potentially incriminating content online, it's reasonable for school officials to have access to that information, even if it's not directly affiliated with the school's name. The notion that officials can access this information from their personal residences is a reality, and it underscores the need for responsible online behavior among students.\n\nHowever, the debate surrounding school officials monitoring online activity raises concerns about privacy. While it's understandable that schools may want to ensure a safe environment, overstepping into the realm of monitoring students' personal online lives can be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThis is a delicate balance, especially considering the potential consequences of not taking proactive measures to prevent incidents like school shootings. While it's true that school officials may have legitimate reasons for monitoring online activity, it's also essential to respect students' right to online privacy. \n\nIn some cases, school officials may use online monitoring as a means to identify potential issues and prevent them from escalating. For instance, if a student is posting about substance use or other concerning behavior, it's reasonable for officials to take note and address the situation. However, this approach must be carefully managed to avoid crossing the line into excessive monitoring.\n\nWhen discussing this topic with a former teacher, I was reminded of the importance of school safety drills and lockdown procedures. These measures are put in place to ensure the well-being of students in the event of an emergency, such as a school shooting. While the specific incident I'm referring to may seem unrelated, it's essential to acknowledge the broader context of school safety and the measures taken to prevent incidents.\n\nUltimately, the goal of school officials is to create a safe and supportive environment for students. While online monitoring can be a valuable tool in achieving this goal, it's crucial to strike a balance between safety and privacy. By being mindful of these considerations, we can work towards creating a more effective and responsible approach to school safety.",
            "My initial perspective on the war was shaped by the personal impact of 9/11. However, as I reflect on the situation now, I realize that our entry into the conflict was likely premature and misguided. While the emotional response to the tragedy was understandable, it appears that we overlooked several crucial aspects and failed to develop a comprehensive plan for the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nOur forces were sent to the region without adequate preparation, and the nature of war in the target country is vastly different from what we experience. The local culture and methods of warfare are often brutal and driven by a desire for self-preservation, rather than a genuine interest in nation-building.\n\nIn retrospect, it seems that our primary motivation for going to war was a desire for revenge, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The decision to invade Iraq was likely influenced by a mix of public sentiment and a perceived need for action following 9/11. While I understand the sentiment behind this decision, I now believe that it was a hasty and misguided one.\n\nLooking back, it's clear that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges we would face. A more measured approach, with a clear plan and a deeper understanding of the local culture, would have been more effective in the long run. Unfortunately, our impulsive response led to a situation that has been difficult to extricate ourselves from.\n\nThe reality is that the country we intervened in is unlikely to change its fundamental nature, and our attempts to impose our will on them have been counterproductive. In many ways, our presence has become a catalyst for further division and conflict, rather than a force for stability.\n\nWhile we have made some progress, it's clear that our presence is no longer tenable. The fact is that we can't stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued involvement is only serving to perpetuate a cycle of violence and instability. It's time for us to acknowledge that our intervention has not achieved its intended goals and to begin planning for a responsible exit strategy."
