            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces a challenge in retaining its following due to its stance on certain issues.  One reason for this decline may be the Church's reluctance to adapt to changing societal values.  Specifically, its views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have led to a growing divergence between the Church and its adherents.  While the Church's strong stance on these matters is understandable, its views may be seen as outdated by some.\n\nAs a result, individuals who hold different opinions on these issues may feel uneasy about affiliating with the Church.  For instance, those who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage may find it difficult to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, the Church's stance on these issues may deter individuals who value inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Catholic Church's reluctance to ordain female priests and permit priests to marry is another area of contention.  While some may argue that these changes would not have prevented past controversies, it is worth considering whether greater flexibility in these areas could help the Church stay relevant.  After all, many professionals in other fields balance their work and personal lives, and there is no reason why priests should be held to a different standard.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church's stance on these issues may be a major factor in its declining popularity.  By adopting a more inclusive and flexible approach, the Church may be able to reconnect with its followers and attract a new generation of adherents.  However, this would require the Church to re-examine its traditional views and consider the changing values of modern society.",
            "In my opinion, the issue of gay marriage is a complex one. However, I do not believe that individuals have a choice in their sexual orientation. I think it's essential to recognize that people are born with their orientation, and it's not a decision they make consciously.\n\nI also believe that it's unfair to hold someone accountable for their sexual orientation. It's not something they can change, and it's not something they should be judged for. The idea that a couple of the same sex cannot marry while a heterosexual couple can seems discriminatory and unjust.\n\nI think it's essential to separate the issue of gay marriage from the concept of the federal government's involvement. I don't believe that this is a matter of national security or moral obligation, but rather a personal right that individuals should have the freedom to exercise. The government should not interfere with people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal choices and relationships.\n\nIt's crucial to respect people's differences and not judge them based on their orientation. Gay people are not making a choice, and they should not be punished for being who they are. Ultimately, I think the federal government should stay out of this issue, as it's a matter of individual freedom and human rights.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientation is not a choice, and they should be free to live their lives without judgment or persecution.",
            "I firmly believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, not only for the sake of equality but also due to the numerous benefits it would bring to society. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families. However, this notion is inherently flawed, as it disregards the diversity and individuality of relationships.\n\nLike two sides of the same coin, heterosexual and homosexual relationships share many commonalities. They both involve commitment, love, and a deep emotional bond. The notion that homosexual couples are inherently different is unfounded, and the legal recognition of their relationships should not be denied.\n\nOne of the critical issues that arise when discussing same-sex marriage is the lack of recognition of partners in times of need. For instance, if a partner is hospitalized, their loved one may be denied visitation rights due to not being considered a family member. This is not only unfair but also highlights the need for equal treatment under the law.\n\nScientific studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples face the same challenges and have the same level of relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to marry in a church; rather, they seek a legal document that recognizes their commitment to one another.\n\nThe separation of church and state is often cited as a reason for opposing same-sex marriage. However, this argument is misinformed, as the government's role is to provide a legal framework for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By allowing civil unions, but not marriage, the government is perpetuating a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nThe concerns surrounding adoption and children's well-being are valid, but they are being fueled by misinformation. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as those raised by heterosexual parents. Additionally, many communities have successfully integrated same-sex families, and schools have implemented inclusive policies to support these families.\n\nThe federal government should take a proactive approach to address this issue by making same-sex marriage legal in all states. The current amendment restricting marriage to heterosexual couples is not only unjust but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"Under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome argue that gay people are psychologically damaged or born with a \"defect.\" However, this notion is debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association. It is essential to listen to evidence-based research rather than relying on personal opinions and cultural norms.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more inclusive and just society. It is time for the government to take a stand and ensure that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits and protections as everyone else.",
            "In my experience working at a hospital pharmacy, I've gained a unique perspective on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and societal perceptions. While certain substances are prohibited due to their illicit nature, it's essential to acknowledge their potential benefits. In my opinion, making such substances available to the public without proper regulation would be unwise. However, I firmly believe that their medicinal properties warrant consideration for controlled medical use. The fact that a substance is prohibited doesn't inherently negate its potential advantages.\n\nInterestingly, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are commonly used in pharmacies due to their therapeutic value. These substances are subject to strict regulations, but their benefits cannot be denied. If we can accept the legitimacy of these controlled substances, it's equally important to reevaluate the stigma surrounding marijuana. By recognizing its potential benefits, we can work towards a more informed and nuanced understanding of its use.\n\nOne key difference between marijuana and other substances like alcohol lies in their potential for abuse. While excessive use of either substance can lead to negative consequences, it's crucial to acknowledge the distinct risks associated with each. A gradual introduction of marijuana into the mainstream, accompanied by education and regulation, could potentially mitigate abuse and promote responsible use.\n\nThe widespread negative image surrounding marijuana is largely due to its illicit status. However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction and address the misconceptions surrounding this substance. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively low. By dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding marijuana, we can foster a more responsible and informed approach to its use.",
            "The Catholic Church has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the changing times, embracing a more modern and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the strict traditions of the past, replaced by a more casual and inclusive environment. My personal experiences attending church services have shown a notable shift in the way people dress and interact with one another. What used to be a formal affair has given way to a more laid-back atmosphere, especially during the summer months when people often attend in casual beachwear.\n\nThis change is evident not only in the dress code but also in the overall tone of the services. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it more accessible to those with busy schedules, allowing them to participate in their faith without feeling obligated to adhere to a strict time commitment. The presence of families and children has also become more prominent, which is a positive development in creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nWhile I am not well-versed in the inner workings of the church's politics, I can speak to the issue of clergy misconduct. In my opinion, the recent scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church are a complex issue with deep-seated causes. I do not believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining female priests would have been a solution to this problem. Research suggests that pedophilia is a pre-existing condition, often linked to genetic factors, rather than a result of environmental influences. While marriage may provide a sense of fulfillment and stability for some individuals, it is unlikely to alter their inherent tendencies.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that clergy misconduct is not exclusive to the Catholic Church, and it is not solely the result of their celibacy or lack thereof. Rather, it is a symptom of a broader societal issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. If the church or any institution is aware of such misconduct and attempts to cover it up, it is indeed shameful. However, I do not believe that the root cause of this issue lies in the church's policies regarding marriage or ordination.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church has made strides in adapting to the modern world, the issue of clergy misconduct is a more complex and deeply ingrained problem that cannot be simply resolved by altering its practices. Ultimately, it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.",
            "The Iraq war has left a lasting impression on me, and while I initially supported the premise of military action, I have serious concerns about the motivations behind it. Following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration hastily linked Iraq to the terrorist threat, asserting the existence of weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been thoroughly discredited. This deliberate misrepresentation of facts has been a source of great frustration for me.\n\nThe administration's propensity for deception is particularly disturbing, especially given the dire consequences. Colin Powell's subsequent admission that he was unconvinced by the evidence he presented to the UN highlights the scope of this issue. I believe that such deliberate falsehoods are a serious breach of the public's trust and an impeachable offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution has been alarming, particularly in its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th. It is clear that their intention from the outset was to pursue a war in Iraq.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, including a former treasury secretary, George W. Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein may have been driven in part by a desire to expand the country's energy supply. This underhanded motive has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region.\n\nWhile it is true that a sudden withdrawal from Iraq could lead to civil war and further bloodshed, I believe that the current situation has dragged on for far too long. The proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, may not be the most effective or sustainable approach. Iraq's sovereignty will likely remain a contentious issue, and the current interim government's ineffectiveness has exacerbated the problem.\n\nNews reports indicate that the Iraqi Parliament is struggling to assert its authority, and the Prime Minister's influence is being undermined by radical factions vying for control. This fractious environment has hindered the country's development and is an obstacle to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the complexities of the Iraq situation are multifaceted and far-reaching. While I can't articulate a clear-cut solution, I firmly believe that the current path is unsustainable, and a more constructive approach is needed to address the ongoing conflict.",
            "One of the most contentious issues of our time is the War in Iraq. I'm not quite sure where to begin, but I'll try to provide some insight into my perspective.\n\nInitially, I felt that the war was somewhat pointless, given that it wasn't officially declared. It seemed to me that the primary motivation was to retaliate against the country perceived to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Consequently, I didn't closely follow the developments of the war.\n\nHowever, I've come to understand that our presence in Iraq is largely aimed at establishing democracy and securing oil resources. While this may not be the most compelling reason to continue the war, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities involved. On one hand, staying in Iraq would allow us to create a stable democracy, albeit a lengthy and challenging process. On the other hand, our prolonged presence could be seen as an attempt to mold Iraq into a replica of the United States, potentially exacerbating the situation.\n\nMoreover, the war has significant humanitarian consequences, including the displacement of children from their families and the disruption of education. It's essential to consider the impact of our actions on the Iraqi people and the potential for the Al-Qaeda insurgency to grow stronger due to our intervention.\n\nI've come to realize that this conflict is not as black-and-white as it seems. As a nation, we must weigh the pros and cons of our involvement and consider the long-term effects on both the Iraqis and ourselves. In my opinion, the war has the potential to become a long and arduous process, with uncertain outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lack of congressional declaration has raised questions about the legitimacy of the war. As a nation, we should strive to operate within the bounds of our democratic institutions and respect the principles of our government.\n\nUltimately, the decision to continue or withdraw from Iraq is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. While I'm not an expert on the topic, I believe that our actions should be guided by empathy for the Iraqi people and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.",
            "There is a strong argument to be made that government involvement in matters of religious beliefs can be problematic. The constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state suggests that it is not the role of the government to dictate what is or is not acceptable within religious institutions. This separation has been a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to practice their faith without fear of government interference.\n\nThe idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices could be seen as contradictory to the principles enshrined in the constitution. Such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, undermining the very foundation of our democratic system. Furthermore, the motivations behind such a move would need to be carefully examined, particularly if they are driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nIn the context of the proposed amendment, it is essential to consider the potential impact on society. While the economic implications are unclear, it is possible that recognizing and respecting individual freedoms of faith could have a positive effect on the social fabric of our nation. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed should be left to the churches and their respective congregations, rather than being dictated by government edict.\n\nThe notion that the federal government or any public official should impose their will on matters of faith is concerning, especially when it appears to be driven by personal biases rather than a desire to serve the greater good. By respecting the separation of church and state, we can promote a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there may be valid concerns, it is essential to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal agendas to drive policy decisions.",
            "The Iraq War has left a profound impact on the world, sparking intense debates and raising questions about the motivations behind the conflict. In my opinion, the government's initial justification for the invasion was not entirely transparent to the American people. The administration's attempt to link the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and it played on the public's emotions to garner support for the war.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was critical of the invasion from the start. The war in Iraq shares eerie similarities with the Vietnam War, where the government underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges of implementing democracy in a foreign country. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was a significant challenge, and the US government was not adequately prepared for the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe consequences of the war have been dire, with countless American lives lost and ongoing efforts to train the Iraqi military and police forces. The US government's assumption that the invasion would be a swift and successful endeavor was overly optimistic, given the historical precedents of similar conflicts.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is clear that the government's decision-making process was flawed. The Bush administration's claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false, raises concerns about the government's honesty and thoroughness in its decision-making. Furthermore, the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not the target of similar military actions, suggests a potential motive driven by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to spread democracy.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Iraq has raised difficult questions about the morality of military intervention and the true motivations behind it. While it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility towards the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly as a result of the invasion, the human cost of the war cannot be ignored. As the war enters its second decade, it is essential to re-examine the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nThe Iraq War has also sparked discussions about the role of oil and resources in international relations. The fact that Iraq is a significant oil producer and the US government's stated reason for the invasion was to spread democracy and remove a \"rogue\" regime, while conveniently overlooking other countries with similar characteristics, raises suspicions about the true motives behind the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict continues, I can only hope that a peaceful resolution is reached, and the Iraqi people can finally find stability and security. However, the path forward is uncertain, and it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges involved in creating a democratic government in a country ravaged by war.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage has been unwavering throughout my life. I firmly believe that an individual's sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and it should not be subject to societal or governmental restrictions. Recent scientific research has shed light on the biological factors contributing to an individual's sexual orientation, suggesting that it may not be entirely a matter of upbringing or social conditioning.\n\nIn my opinion, it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something that is largely beyond their control. I strongly advocate for the rights of same-sex couples to be recognized and respected.\n\nThe issue here is not about politics or government intervention, but rather about allowing individuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. I have witnessed firsthand the normalcy of same-sex relationships in my community, where gay couples live and interact with their neighbors just like any other family unit. It's time for our society to acknowledge and accept this reality.\n\nThe concept of marriage should be private and personal, not subject to public scrutiny or governmental regulations. If a heterosexual couple can choose to get married without drawing attention to themselves, why should the same not be true for same-sex couples? It's a matter of equality and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nWhile some may argue that marriage is a social construct, I believe that it is a fundamental human right that should be accessible to all, regardless of one's sexual orientation. By recognizing this, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One of the challenges of online communication is that once you share something on the internet, it becomes a matter of public record. As someone who has experience in a residential advisor role, I've seen firsthand how this can be a concern. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and in some cases, it can have serious consequences.\n\nFor instance, if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, it's likely to attract attention from others. Someone might report it to the authorities or school administrators, who then have to take action. This is because the internet is a publicly accessible space, and any content you post can be seen by a wide audience.\n\nI recall an incident at my school where a student made a comment that was misinterpreted as a threat. An overheard conversation was reported to the authorities, and after investigating, it was discovered that the student had posted something online that was meant as a joke. However, in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe key point to remember is that once you post something online, you're giving up a level of control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want people to know something about you, it's best not to post it online. You can't dictate how others will react to what you share, and you can't force them to take it lightly.\n\nWhile I don't think it's appropriate for school officials to be friends with students on social media or monitoring their online activity without consent, if a concern is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take action. This is especially true if there's a potential threat to safety.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, I believe it's best for educators to maintain a professional distance from their students online. As an R.A., I don't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to intrude on their personal lives or be privy to information that might create a conflict of interest. By keeping a professional boundary, I can focus on supporting their academic and personal growth without compromising our relationship.",
            "The ongoing conflict has become excessively prolonged, deviating from its original intent. Initially, the objective was to establish democracy in a country plagued by an unfair political system, a goal that warrants consideration. However, over time, the mission seems to have lost its focus, and the driving force behind it appears to have shifted from promoting democracy to showcasing military prowess.\n\nThe motives behind the initial invasion are also suspect, particularly considering the historical tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While an altruistic aim to establish democracy is understandable, it becomes questionable when personal vendettas are involved.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the war made a significant statement, highlighting the determination to intervene. Nonetheless, the prolonged duration, spanning several years, has led to a protracted and increasingly costly endeavor. It is arguable that the purpose has been undermined, and the war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, driven by the desire to maintain a military presence rather than to achieve a decisive victory.\n\nThe financial burden of this conflict is substantial, diverting billions of dollars from domestic priorities such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and healthcare. These domestic issues, such as public roads, education, and healthcare, are pressing concerns that require attention and funding. It is imperative to reassess the allocation of resources, prioritizing the needs of our own citizens over the prolonged engagement in a foreign conflict. Ultimately, the war has become a costly and seemingly futile endeavor, draining our economy and diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.",
            "When considering whether a student's online profile or activity can be monitored to prevent harm, several factors come into play. For instance, social media platforms like Myspace often require users to allow others to access their profiles by accepting them as friends or acquaintances. In doing so, individuals essentially grant permission for those individuals to view their personal information.\n\nThis raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be traced and monitored. While it's impossible to have a single person continuously monitor every student's online presence, it's also not feasible to simply block certain individuals from accessing the internet. Instead, schools might consider implementing guidelines or policies regarding online safety and responsible behavior.\n\nSome argue that schools have a responsibility to protect students from potential harm, particularly if they have reason to believe that a student may be in danger. In this context, monitoring online activity might be justified. However, this raises issues of privacy and potential discrimination. Schools would need to carefully weigh the benefits of monitoring against the potential risks and ensure that any policies are fair and applied consistently.\n\nThe boundaries between personal and public spaces online are increasingly blurred. Platforms like Myspace and Facebook expose users to a wide audience, and individuals may share personal information without fully realizing its accessibility. This can be concerning, especially considering the ease with which strangers can gather information about others online.\n\nA notable example of this vulnerability can be seen in cases where individuals have used social media to gather sensitive information about others. For instance, a recent television program demonstrated how a person was able to gather a stranger's screen name and establish contact through instant messaging. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing personal details online.\n\nMany students, including myself, have Myspace profiles to connect with friends and maintain social relationships. However, this also means that we must navigate the risks associated with online sharing. It's essential to strike a balance between opening ourselves up to others and protecting our personal information.\n\nIn some cases, schools may restrict access to social media platforms, as was the case in my roommate's high school. While this may seem like an overreach, it also raises important questions about the boundaries between school and personal life. I'm not sure whether it's a matter of privacy or authority, but it's certainly a complex issue.\n\nOverall, the intersection of online safety, privacy, and responsibility is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and it's difficult to approach the subject without acknowledging the complex web of opinions surrounding it. As someone who has grappled with the nuances of this issue, I find myself reflecting on the overwhelming consensus that the war was a misguided endeavor. The vast majority of global polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and internationally, suggest that upwards of 75-80% of the population believes the war was a miscalculation.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by a significant portion of the US military personnel currently stationed in Iraq, with around 70% expressing the opinion that the war was a mistake and that withdrawal within the year is the most prudent course of action. The fact that the war has been widely regarded as a disaster from its inception, with no clear path forward for a successful exit, highlights the enormity of the challenge.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this debacle is the profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region with such a distinct cultural identity is a notion that has been repeatedly proven flawed. The previous administration's decision to invade Iraq was based on a simplistic understanding of the local context, which overlooked the complexities of the region.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, any evaluation of the war's justification requires a balanced consideration of the potential consequences. The catastrophic outcome that unfolded was predictable, and it's essential to acknowledge that the war was not a well-thought-out decision.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, it's becoming increasingly clear that there is no compelling argument to justify an extended US presence. The administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal over a year or more may be a step in the right direction, but the fundamental question remains: what is the purpose of our continued involvement? The voices of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for our departure, should be given significant weight in this decision. It's time to listen to their perspective and recognize that they may possess a deeper understanding of their own situation.\n\nUltimately, if we were to ask the Iraqi people whether they want us to leave, and they respond with a resounding \"yes,\" it would provide a clear justification for our exit. This approach would also absolve us of any potential blame for the consequences of our departure. If we were to decide to assist the Iraqi people after we leave, we could at least do so in a position of moral clarity, rather than being seen as occupying forces.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complicated and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our continued involvement is no longer justified. It's time for us to listen to the voices of the Iraqi people and to reevaluate our role in this conflict.",
            "Gender inequality remains a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in certain professional settings. It's not limited to women, as various fields, including the corporate world, fashion, and even parenting, exhibit inherent biases. The \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women face obstacles in advancing to leadership positions, is a notable example. \n\nWhile societal norms have evolved over time, deeply ingrained attitudes persist. Women are often held to a higher standard, with their professional abilities being scrutinized more closely than men's. Conversely, men who choose to stay at home to raise their children face stigma, as people often expect them to be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are passionate about fashion may be perceived as less credible due to traditional stereotypes. This can be overcome by highlighting the qualities and expertise of individuals who defy these expectations. A gradual shift in societal attitudes is underway, with more people accepting women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads. However, promoting this change requires a delicate approach, as forced efforts can lead to resistance.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic factors can also contribute to inequality. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of gender, may face prejudice based on their educational background or communication skills. For instance, a CEO from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged on their ability to articulate their thoughts, rather than their intelligence or business acumen.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that inequality is not limited to gender; various factors, including socioeconomic status and geographical background, can also contribute to prejudice. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the complexities of societal attitudes and the need for gradual change.",
            "There seems to be a shift in the way the law addresses marijuana possession, from treating it as a criminal offense to a more minor infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change is significant, as it spares individuals from the more severe consequences associated with a criminal charge, such as arrest and court appearances. However, the long-term implications of a decriminalized marijuana policy can still be a concern for those who worry about its impact on their future, particularly in the context of employment and other professional opportunities.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of decriminalization is that it can help alleviate the financial burden on local law enforcement and the judicial system. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession can be resource-intensive and costly. By reducing the number of arrests and court appearances, municipalities can redirect these resources to more pressing community needs, such as public education, social programs, and support services for vulnerable populations.\n\nDenver's approach to marijuana decriminalization is a notable example of this strategy. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana possession, the city has been able to free up resources for more constructive purposes. This is particularly relevant in areas where communities have traditionally been skeptical of marijuana use.\n\nWhile there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of widespread marijuana use, such as increased accidents and public health issues, it's essential to consider the complexities of individual reactions to the substance. People's responses to marijuana can vary greatly, and some may be more susceptible to its effects than others. Moreover, attitudes towards marijuana use are often influenced by cultural and personal factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize marijuana is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks. By considering the financial, social, and individual implications, we can work towards a more informed and evidence-based approach to marijuana policy.",
            "While I acknowledge the importance of tradition in many aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that a balance between preserving heritage and embracing change is crucial. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally essential to adapt to evolving societal norms and values.\n\nOne aspect that has always puzzled me is the perceived disconnect between Catholic doctrine and its application. On one hand, the Church emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, as seen in its teachings on tolerance and compassion. On the other hand, certain practices, such as excluding individuals from the community due to their religious background or perceived imperfections, seem to contradict this message.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' situation. As an Episcopalian, my father was not eligible for a Catholic ceremony, despite my mother's Catholic faith and my own upbringing in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's ideals of acceptance and its more rigid practices.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I think it's essential to consider the potential impact on the institution. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could alleviate certain problems, such as pedophilia, I'm not convinced that this would be a solution. The complexities of human behavior are multifaceted, and individuals who engage in such reprehensible actions are likely driven by factors beyond their marital status.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the Catholic Church should strive to reconcile its doctrine with its practices, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all members of the community.",
            "The issue of church and state separation is especially challenging when considering the definition of marriage. Balancing the involvement of the government in this matter can be delicate, as it involves determining the extent to which a personal, deeply held institution should be regulated by the state. The government's role in recognizing and defining marriage is a complex issue that must be approached with sensitivity.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider the distinction between civil unions and marriage. In this context, marriage is seen as a sacrament or a deeply personal commitment between two individuals, rather than a solely governmental concern. This perspective suggests that the government's role should be limited to recognizing and enforcing the legal aspects of a union, rather than imposing its own definition of what constitutes a valid marriage.\n\nIf the primary focus is on the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, then perhaps it would be more practical to view it as a civil union. This approach would allow the government to maintain a neutral stance on the issue, avoiding entanglement in the deeply personal and often contentious aspects of religious belief.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in defining marriage. If the goal is to establish a uniform national standard, it may be more effective to work towards a federal law that addresses the issue, rather than relying on individual state-by-state solutions.\n\nHowever, amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it represents a significant manipulation of the fundamental document. The constitution should be amended only when dealing with matters of grave national importance, and this issue, while significant to some, may not meet that threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the definition of marriage and the government's role in it is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. A more nuanced approach, focusing on the separation of church and state, and recognizing the complexities of the issue, may be more beneficial than imposing a broad, sweeping solution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have navigated the complexities of homosexuality through various perspectives. Having close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of the issue. While I may not personally adhere to the same lifestyle, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding their personal lives.\n\nIn a democratic society, it is essential to respect the autonomy of each state in making decisions that affect its citizens. By decentralizing the decision-making process, we can ensure that each region's values and values-based policies are reflected in their laws. This approach also acknowledges the diverse nature of the country, where different states have different cultural, social, and political landscapes.\n\nMy stance on gay marriage is founded on the principle of equality and individual freedom. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, deserves the same opportunities and rights. The decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to each state, allowing them to align their laws with their unique values and societal norms. This approach promotes inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for diversity.\n\nRegarding the current federal ban on gay marriage, I don't believe it is the president's role to impose a uniform stance across the country. Each state should have the authority to make its own decisions, free from federal interference. This would enable states to adapt to the changing values and needs of their citizens. Moreover, as the president's term is limited, I believe that the decision should be left to the next administration, ensuring a more transparent and democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a decentralized approach to addressing gay marriage, allowing each state to chart its own course. This approach honors the diversity of the country and promotes a more inclusive and respectful society for all individuals.",
            "In reflecting on the issue of school officials monitoring student activity on online platforms like Myspace, I must consider the balance between personal freedom and school safety. On one hand, Myspace is a public forum where users post content for the world to see. If a student shares information on this platform, they should be aware that it may be accessed by not only their peers but also school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety. If monitoring Myspace helps identify potential concerns or issues that could compromise school security, I think it's reasonable for officials to take notice. Even if the content is not posted under the school's name, they may still be able to access it through their own means.\n\nSome might argue that monitoring student online activity is an invasion of privacy. However, I'd like to propose that this perspective is shortsighted. If officials can use this information to prevent harm and create a safer school environment, I don't believe it's an unreasonable intrusion. In fact, I've spoken to a teacher who shared that they perform online monitoring to detect potential issues, such as substance abuse or other illicit activities.\n\nThis is not entirely unlike the lockdown drills we had in my high school, which were implemented in response to concerns about terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to the issue at hand, they demonstrate the school's commitment to ensuring student safety. By monitoring Myspace, officials are essentially taking a similar proactive approach.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in today's digital age, online content can be enduring and far-reaching. A single post or email can resurface years down the line and cause unintended consequences. This reality underscores the importance of responsible online behavior.\n\nUltimately, I believe that school officials have a responsibility to create a safe environment for their students. If monitoring online activity helps them achieve this goal, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of students.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective on the war. Initially, I was convinced that a swift and decisive action was necessary to rectify the situation. However, as I began to consider the potential consequences, I started to question the efficacy of our approach. It became apparent that a more measured and thoughtful strategy was required, taking into account the complexities of the region and the people involved.\n\nUpon reflection, I believe that our actions were motivated by a mix of emotions, including a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency to address the atrocity that had occurred. While I understand the sentiment behind this reaction, I now think that it led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the long-term effects of our intervention.\n\nThe fact that the people in the region are often at odds with one another is a significant factor in the ongoing conflict. It seems that as long as they are preoccupied with internal struggles, they are less likely to pose a threat to us. In this context, I question the value of our presence in the region. Rather than trying to impose our values and customs, we might be better off focusing on our own interests and security.\n\nI also think that we underestimated the cultural and historical context of war in that part of the world. The concept of conflict and violence is deeply ingrained in their society, and it's unrealistic to expect that we can change this overnight. In many ways, their approach to war is shaped by their unique cultural and historical experiences, and it's not necessarily comparable to our own experiences.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were motivated by a desire for revenge and a sense of national pride, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. This led to a hasty and ill-prepared intervention, which ultimately had unintended consequences. We should have taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the local dynamics and the potential outcomes of our actions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we made some progress in the region, I believe that it's time for us to reassess our presence and consider a more measured withdrawal. The reality is that we cannot stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued presence may actually hinder the local population's ability to govern themselves. It's in our best interest to focus on our own security and interests, rather than trying to impose our will on a region that is fundamentally different from our own."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces a challenge in retaining its following due to its stance on certain issues.  One reason for this decline may be the Church's reluctance to adapt to changing societal values.  Specifically, its views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have led to a growing divergence between the Church and its adherents.  While the Church's strong stance on these matters is understandable, its views may be seen as outdated by some.\n\nAs a result, individuals who hold different opinions on these issues may feel uneasy about affiliating with the Church.  For instance, those who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage may find it difficult to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, the Church's stance on these issues may deter individuals who value inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Catholic Church's reluctance to ordain female priests and permit priests to marry is another area of contention.  While some may argue that these changes would not have prevented past controversies, it is worth considering whether greater flexibility in these areas could help the Church stay relevant.  After all, many professionals in other fields balance their work and personal lives, and there is no reason why priests should be held to a different standard.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church's stance on these issues may be a major factor in its declining popularity.  By adopting a more inclusive and flexible approach, the Church may be able to reconnect with its followers and attract a new generation of adherents.  However, this would require the Church to re-examine its traditional views and consider the changing values of modern society.",
            "In my opinion, the issue of gay marriage is a complex one. However, I do not believe that individuals have a choice in their sexual orientation. I think it's essential to recognize that people are born with their orientation, and it's not a decision they make consciously.\n\nI also believe that it's unfair to hold someone accountable for their sexual orientation. It's not something they can change, and it's not something they should be judged for. The idea that a couple of the same sex cannot marry while a heterosexual couple can seems discriminatory and unjust.\n\nI think it's essential to separate the issue of gay marriage from the concept of the federal government's involvement. I don't believe that this is a matter of national security or moral obligation, but rather a personal right that individuals should have the freedom to exercise. The government should not interfere with people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal choices and relationships.\n\nIt's crucial to respect people's differences and not judge them based on their orientation. Gay people are not making a choice, and they should not be punished for being who they are. Ultimately, I think the federal government should stay out of this issue, as it's a matter of individual freedom and human rights.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientation is not a choice, and they should be free to live their lives without judgment or persecution.",
            "I firmly believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, not only for the sake of equality but also due to the numerous benefits it would bring to society. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families. However, this notion is inherently flawed, as it disregards the diversity and individuality of relationships.\n\nLike two sides of the same coin, heterosexual and homosexual relationships share many commonalities. They both involve commitment, love, and a deep emotional bond. The notion that homosexual couples are inherently different is unfounded, and the legal recognition of their relationships should not be denied.\n\nOne of the critical issues that arise when discussing same-sex marriage is the lack of recognition of partners in times of need. For instance, if a partner is hospitalized, their loved one may be denied visitation rights due to not being considered a family member. This is not only unfair but also highlights the need for equal treatment under the law.\n\nScientific studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples face the same challenges and have the same level of relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to marry in a church; rather, they seek a legal document that recognizes their commitment to one another.\n\nThe separation of church and state is often cited as a reason for opposing same-sex marriage. However, this argument is misinformed, as the government's role is to provide a legal framework for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By allowing civil unions, but not marriage, the government is perpetuating a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nThe concerns surrounding adoption and children's well-being are valid, but they are being fueled by misinformation. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as those raised by heterosexual parents. Additionally, many communities have successfully integrated same-sex families, and schools have implemented inclusive policies to support these families.\n\nThe federal government should take a proactive approach to address this issue by making same-sex marriage legal in all states. The current amendment restricting marriage to heterosexual couples is not only unjust but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"Under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome argue that gay people are psychologically damaged or born with a \"defect.\" However, this notion is debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association. It is essential to listen to evidence-based research rather than relying on personal opinions and cultural norms.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more inclusive and just society. It is time for the government to take a stand and ensure that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits and protections as everyone else.",
            "In my experience working at a hospital pharmacy, I've gained a unique perspective on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and societal perceptions. While certain substances are prohibited due to their illicit nature, it's essential to acknowledge their potential benefits. In my opinion, making such substances available to the public without proper regulation would be unwise. However, I firmly believe that their medicinal properties warrant consideration for controlled medical use. The fact that a substance is prohibited doesn't inherently negate its potential advantages.\n\nInterestingly, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are commonly used in pharmacies due to their therapeutic value. These substances are subject to strict regulations, but their benefits cannot be denied. If we can accept the legitimacy of these controlled substances, it's equally important to reevaluate the stigma surrounding marijuana. By recognizing its potential benefits, we can work towards a more informed and nuanced understanding of its use.\n\nOne key difference between marijuana and other substances like alcohol lies in their potential for abuse. While excessive use of either substance can lead to negative consequences, it's crucial to acknowledge the distinct risks associated with each. A gradual introduction of marijuana into the mainstream, accompanied by education and regulation, could potentially mitigate abuse and promote responsible use.\n\nThe widespread negative image surrounding marijuana is largely due to its illicit status. However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction and address the misconceptions surrounding this substance. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively low. By dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding marijuana, we can foster a more responsible and informed approach to its use.",
            "The Catholic Church has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the changing times, embracing a more modern and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the strict traditions of the past, replaced by a more casual and inclusive environment. My personal experiences attending church services have shown a notable shift in the way people dress and interact with one another. What used to be a formal affair has given way to a more laid-back atmosphere, especially during the summer months when people often attend in casual beachwear.\n\nThis change is evident not only in the dress code but also in the overall tone of the services. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it more accessible to those with busy schedules, allowing them to participate in their faith without feeling obligated to adhere to a strict time commitment. The presence of families and children has also become more prominent, which is a positive development in creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nWhile I am not well-versed in the inner workings of the church's politics, I can speak to the issue of clergy misconduct. In my opinion, the recent scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church are a complex issue with deep-seated causes. I do not believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining female priests would have been a solution to this problem. Research suggests that pedophilia is a pre-existing condition, often linked to genetic factors, rather than a result of environmental influences. While marriage may provide a sense of fulfillment and stability for some individuals, it is unlikely to alter their inherent tendencies.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that clergy misconduct is not exclusive to the Catholic Church, and it is not solely the result of their celibacy or lack thereof. Rather, it is a symptom of a broader societal issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. If the church or any institution is aware of such misconduct and attempts to cover it up, it is indeed shameful. However, I do not believe that the root cause of this issue lies in the church's policies regarding marriage or ordination.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church has made strides in adapting to the modern world, the issue of clergy misconduct is a more complex and deeply ingrained problem that cannot be simply resolved by altering its practices. Ultimately, it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.",
            "The Iraq war has left a lasting impression on me, and while I initially supported the premise of military action, I have serious concerns about the motivations behind it. Following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration hastily linked Iraq to the terrorist threat, asserting the existence of weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been thoroughly discredited. This deliberate misrepresentation of facts has been a source of great frustration for me.\n\nThe administration's propensity for deception is particularly disturbing, especially given the dire consequences. Colin Powell's subsequent admission that he was unconvinced by the evidence he presented to the UN highlights the scope of this issue. I believe that such deliberate falsehoods are a serious breach of the public's trust and an impeachable offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution has been alarming, particularly in its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th. It is clear that their intention from the outset was to pursue a war in Iraq.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, including a former treasury secretary, George W. Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein may have been driven in part by a desire to expand the country's energy supply. This underhanded motive has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region.\n\nWhile it is true that a sudden withdrawal from Iraq could lead to civil war and further bloodshed, I believe that the current situation has dragged on for far too long. The proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, may not be the most effective or sustainable approach. Iraq's sovereignty will likely remain a contentious issue, and the current interim government's ineffectiveness has exacerbated the problem.\n\nNews reports indicate that the Iraqi Parliament is struggling to assert its authority, and the Prime Minister's influence is being undermined by radical factions vying for control. This fractious environment has hindered the country's development and is an obstacle to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the complexities of the Iraq situation are multifaceted and far-reaching. While I can't articulate a clear-cut solution, I firmly believe that the current path is unsustainable, and a more constructive approach is needed to address the ongoing conflict.",
            "One of the most contentious issues of our time is the War in Iraq. I'm not quite sure where to begin, but I'll try to provide some insight into my perspective.\n\nInitially, I felt that the war was somewhat pointless, given that it wasn't officially declared. It seemed to me that the primary motivation was to retaliate against the country perceived to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Consequently, I didn't closely follow the developments of the war.\n\nHowever, I've come to understand that our presence in Iraq is largely aimed at establishing democracy and securing oil resources. While this may not be the most compelling reason to continue the war, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities involved. On one hand, staying in Iraq would allow us to create a stable democracy, albeit a lengthy and challenging process. On the other hand, our prolonged presence could be seen as an attempt to mold Iraq into a replica of the United States, potentially exacerbating the situation.\n\nMoreover, the war has significant humanitarian consequences, including the displacement of children from their families and the disruption of education. It's essential to consider the impact of our actions on the Iraqi people and the potential for the Al-Qaeda insurgency to grow stronger due to our intervention.\n\nI've come to realize that this conflict is not as black-and-white as it seems. As a nation, we must weigh the pros and cons of our involvement and consider the long-term effects on both the Iraqis and ourselves. In my opinion, the war has the potential to become a long and arduous process, with uncertain outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lack of congressional declaration has raised questions about the legitimacy of the war. As a nation, we should strive to operate within the bounds of our democratic institutions and respect the principles of our government.\n\nUltimately, the decision to continue or withdraw from Iraq is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. While I'm not an expert on the topic, I believe that our actions should be guided by empathy for the Iraqi people and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.",
            "There is a strong argument to be made that government involvement in matters of religious beliefs can be problematic. The constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state suggests that it is not the role of the government to dictate what is or is not acceptable within religious institutions. This separation has been a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to practice their faith without fear of government interference.\n\nThe idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices could be seen as contradictory to the principles enshrined in the constitution. Such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, undermining the very foundation of our democratic system. Furthermore, the motivations behind such a move would need to be carefully examined, particularly if they are driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nIn the context of the proposed amendment, it is essential to consider the potential impact on society. While the economic implications are unclear, it is possible that recognizing and respecting individual freedoms of faith could have a positive effect on the social fabric of our nation. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed should be left to the churches and their respective congregations, rather than being dictated by government edict.\n\nThe notion that the federal government or any public official should impose their will on matters of faith is concerning, especially when it appears to be driven by personal biases rather than a desire to serve the greater good. By respecting the separation of church and state, we can promote a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there may be valid concerns, it is essential to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal agendas to drive policy decisions.",
            "The Iraq War has left a profound impact on the world, sparking intense debates and raising questions about the motivations behind the conflict. In my opinion, the government's initial justification for the invasion was not entirely transparent to the American people. The administration's attempt to link the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and it played on the public's emotions to garner support for the war.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was critical of the invasion from the start. The war in Iraq shares eerie similarities with the Vietnam War, where the government underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges of implementing democracy in a foreign country. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was a significant challenge, and the US government was not adequately prepared for the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe consequences of the war have been dire, with countless American lives lost and ongoing efforts to train the Iraqi military and police forces. The US government's assumption that the invasion would be a swift and successful endeavor was overly optimistic, given the historical precedents of similar conflicts.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is clear that the government's decision-making process was flawed. The Bush administration's claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false, raises concerns about the government's honesty and thoroughness in its decision-making. Furthermore, the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not the target of similar military actions, suggests a potential motive driven by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to spread democracy.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Iraq has raised difficult questions about the morality of military intervention and the true motivations behind it. While it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility towards the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly as a result of the invasion, the human cost of the war cannot be ignored. As the war enters its second decade, it is essential to re-examine the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nThe Iraq War has also sparked discussions about the role of oil and resources in international relations. The fact that Iraq is a significant oil producer and the US government's stated reason for the invasion was to spread democracy and remove a \"rogue\" regime, while conveniently overlooking other countries with similar characteristics, raises suspicions about the true motives behind the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict continues, I can only hope that a peaceful resolution is reached, and the Iraqi people can finally find stability and security. However, the path forward is uncertain, and it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges involved in creating a democratic government in a country ravaged by war.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage has been unwavering throughout my life. I firmly believe that an individual's sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and it should not be subject to societal or governmental restrictions. Recent scientific research has shed light on the biological factors contributing to an individual's sexual orientation, suggesting that it may not be entirely a matter of upbringing or social conditioning.\n\nIn my opinion, it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something that is largely beyond their control. I strongly advocate for the rights of same-sex couples to be recognized and respected.\n\nThe issue here is not about politics or government intervention, but rather about allowing individuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. I have witnessed firsthand the normalcy of same-sex relationships in my community, where gay couples live and interact with their neighbors just like any other family unit. It's time for our society to acknowledge and accept this reality.\n\nThe concept of marriage should be private and personal, not subject to public scrutiny or governmental regulations. If a heterosexual couple can choose to get married without drawing attention to themselves, why should the same not be true for same-sex couples? It's a matter of equality and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nWhile some may argue that marriage is a social construct, I believe that it is a fundamental human right that should be accessible to all, regardless of one's sexual orientation. By recognizing this, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One of the challenges of online communication is that once you share something on the internet, it becomes a matter of public record. As someone who has experience in a residential advisor role, I've seen firsthand how this can be a concern. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and in some cases, it can have serious consequences.\n\nFor instance, if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, it's likely to attract attention from others. Someone might report it to the authorities or school administrators, who then have to take action. This is because the internet is a publicly accessible space, and any content you post can be seen by a wide audience.\n\nI recall an incident at my school where a student made a comment that was misinterpreted as a threat. An overheard conversation was reported to the authorities, and after investigating, it was discovered that the student had posted something online that was meant as a joke. However, in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe key point to remember is that once you post something online, you're giving up a level of control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want people to know something about you, it's best not to post it online. You can't dictate how others will react to what you share, and you can't force them to take it lightly.\n\nWhile I don't think it's appropriate for school officials to be friends with students on social media or monitoring their online activity without consent, if a concern is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take action. This is especially true if there's a potential threat to safety.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, I believe it's best for educators to maintain a professional distance from their students online. As an R.A., I don't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to intrude on their personal lives or be privy to information that might create a conflict of interest. By keeping a professional boundary, I can focus on supporting their academic and personal growth without compromising our relationship.",
            "The ongoing conflict has become excessively prolonged, deviating from its original intent. Initially, the objective was to establish democracy in a country plagued by an unfair political system, a goal that warrants consideration. However, over time, the mission seems to have lost its focus, and the driving force behind it appears to have shifted from promoting democracy to showcasing military prowess.\n\nThe motives behind the initial invasion are also suspect, particularly considering the historical tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While an altruistic aim to establish democracy is understandable, it becomes questionable when personal vendettas are involved.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the war made a significant statement, highlighting the determination to intervene. Nonetheless, the prolonged duration, spanning several years, has led to a protracted and increasingly costly endeavor. It is arguable that the purpose has been undermined, and the war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, driven by the desire to maintain a military presence rather than to achieve a decisive victory.\n\nThe financial burden of this conflict is substantial, diverting billions of dollars from domestic priorities such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and healthcare. These domestic issues, such as public roads, education, and healthcare, are pressing concerns that require attention and funding. It is imperative to reassess the allocation of resources, prioritizing the needs of our own citizens over the prolonged engagement in a foreign conflict. Ultimately, the war has become a costly and seemingly futile endeavor, draining our economy and diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.",
            "When considering whether a student's online profile or activity can be monitored to prevent harm, several factors come into play. For instance, social media platforms like Myspace often require users to allow others to access their profiles by accepting them as friends or acquaintances. In doing so, individuals essentially grant permission for those individuals to view their personal information.\n\nThis raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be traced and monitored. While it's impossible to have a single person continuously monitor every student's online presence, it's also not feasible to simply block certain individuals from accessing the internet. Instead, schools might consider implementing guidelines or policies regarding online safety and responsible behavior.\n\nSome argue that schools have a responsibility to protect students from potential harm, particularly if they have reason to believe that a student may be in danger. In this context, monitoring online activity might be justified. However, this raises issues of privacy and potential discrimination. Schools would need to carefully weigh the benefits of monitoring against the potential risks and ensure that any policies are fair and applied consistently.\n\nThe boundaries between personal and public spaces online are increasingly blurred. Platforms like Myspace and Facebook expose users to a wide audience, and individuals may share personal information without fully realizing its accessibility. This can be concerning, especially considering the ease with which strangers can gather information about others online.\n\nA notable example of this vulnerability can be seen in cases where individuals have used social media to gather sensitive information about others. For instance, a recent television program demonstrated how a person was able to gather a stranger's screen name and establish contact through instant messaging. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing personal details online.\n\nMany students, including myself, have Myspace profiles to connect with friends and maintain social relationships. However, this also means that we must navigate the risks associated with online sharing. It's essential to strike a balance between opening ourselves up to others and protecting our personal information.\n\nIn some cases, schools may restrict access to social media platforms, as was the case in my roommate's high school. While this may seem like an overreach, it also raises important questions about the boundaries between school and personal life. I'm not sure whether it's a matter of privacy or authority, but it's certainly a complex issue.\n\nOverall, the intersection of online safety, privacy, and responsibility is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and it's difficult to approach the subject without acknowledging the complex web of opinions surrounding it. As someone who has grappled with the nuances of this issue, I find myself reflecting on the overwhelming consensus that the war was a misguided endeavor. The vast majority of global polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and internationally, suggest that upwards of 75-80% of the population believes the war was a miscalculation.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by a significant portion of the US military personnel currently stationed in Iraq, with around 70% expressing the opinion that the war was a mistake and that withdrawal within the year is the most prudent course of action. The fact that the war has been widely regarded as a disaster from its inception, with no clear path forward for a successful exit, highlights the enormity of the challenge.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this debacle is the profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region with such a distinct cultural identity is a notion that has been repeatedly proven flawed. The previous administration's decision to invade Iraq was based on a simplistic understanding of the local context, which overlooked the complexities of the region.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, any evaluation of the war's justification requires a balanced consideration of the potential consequences. The catastrophic outcome that unfolded was predictable, and it's essential to acknowledge that the war was not a well-thought-out decision.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, it's becoming increasingly clear that there is no compelling argument to justify an extended US presence. The administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal over a year or more may be a step in the right direction, but the fundamental question remains: what is the purpose of our continued involvement? The voices of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for our departure, should be given significant weight in this decision. It's time to listen to their perspective and recognize that they may possess a deeper understanding of their own situation.\n\nUltimately, if we were to ask the Iraqi people whether they want us to leave, and they respond with a resounding \"yes,\" it would provide a clear justification for our exit. This approach would also absolve us of any potential blame for the consequences of our departure. If we were to decide to assist the Iraqi people after we leave, we could at least do so in a position of moral clarity, rather than being seen as occupying forces.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complicated and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our continued involvement is no longer justified. It's time for us to listen to the voices of the Iraqi people and to reevaluate our role in this conflict.",
            "Gender inequality remains a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in certain professional settings. It's not limited to women, as various fields, including the corporate world, fashion, and even parenting, exhibit inherent biases. The \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women face obstacles in advancing to leadership positions, is a notable example. \n\nWhile societal norms have evolved over time, deeply ingrained attitudes persist. Women are often held to a higher standard, with their professional abilities being scrutinized more closely than men's. Conversely, men who choose to stay at home to raise their children face stigma, as people often expect them to be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are passionate about fashion may be perceived as less credible due to traditional stereotypes. This can be overcome by highlighting the qualities and expertise of individuals who defy these expectations. A gradual shift in societal attitudes is underway, with more people accepting women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads. However, promoting this change requires a delicate approach, as forced efforts can lead to resistance.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic factors can also contribute to inequality. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of gender, may face prejudice based on their educational background or communication skills. For instance, a CEO from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged on their ability to articulate their thoughts, rather than their intelligence or business acumen.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that inequality is not limited to gender; various factors, including socioeconomic status and geographical background, can also contribute to prejudice. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the complexities of societal attitudes and the need for gradual change.",
            "There seems to be a shift in the way the law addresses marijuana possession, from treating it as a criminal offense to a more minor infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change is significant, as it spares individuals from the more severe consequences associated with a criminal charge, such as arrest and court appearances. However, the long-term implications of a decriminalized marijuana policy can still be a concern for those who worry about its impact on their future, particularly in the context of employment and other professional opportunities.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of decriminalization is that it can help alleviate the financial burden on local law enforcement and the judicial system. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession can be resource-intensive and costly. By reducing the number of arrests and court appearances, municipalities can redirect these resources to more pressing community needs, such as public education, social programs, and support services for vulnerable populations.\n\nDenver's approach to marijuana decriminalization is a notable example of this strategy. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana possession, the city has been able to free up resources for more constructive purposes. This is particularly relevant in areas where communities have traditionally been skeptical of marijuana use.\n\nWhile there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of widespread marijuana use, such as increased accidents and public health issues, it's essential to consider the complexities of individual reactions to the substance. People's responses to marijuana can vary greatly, and some may be more susceptible to its effects than others. Moreover, attitudes towards marijuana use are often influenced by cultural and personal factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize marijuana is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks. By considering the financial, social, and individual implications, we can work towards a more informed and evidence-based approach to marijuana policy.",
            "While I acknowledge the importance of tradition in many aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that a balance between preserving heritage and embracing change is crucial. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally essential to adapt to evolving societal norms and values.\n\nOne aspect that has always puzzled me is the perceived disconnect between Catholic doctrine and its application. On one hand, the Church emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, as seen in its teachings on tolerance and compassion. On the other hand, certain practices, such as excluding individuals from the community due to their religious background or perceived imperfections, seem to contradict this message.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' situation. As an Episcopalian, my father was not eligible for a Catholic ceremony, despite my mother's Catholic faith and my own upbringing in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's ideals of acceptance and its more rigid practices.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I think it's essential to consider the potential impact on the institution. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could alleviate certain problems, such as pedophilia, I'm not convinced that this would be a solution. The complexities of human behavior are multifaceted, and individuals who engage in such reprehensible actions are likely driven by factors beyond their marital status.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the Catholic Church should strive to reconcile its doctrine with its practices, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all members of the community.",
            "The issue of church and state separation is especially challenging when considering the definition of marriage. Balancing the involvement of the government in this matter can be delicate, as it involves determining the extent to which a personal, deeply held institution should be regulated by the state. The government's role in recognizing and defining marriage is a complex issue that must be approached with sensitivity.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider the distinction between civil unions and marriage. In this context, marriage is seen as a sacrament or a deeply personal commitment between two individuals, rather than a solely governmental concern. This perspective suggests that the government's role should be limited to recognizing and enforcing the legal aspects of a union, rather than imposing its own definition of what constitutes a valid marriage.\n\nIf the primary focus is on the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, then perhaps it would be more practical to view it as a civil union. This approach would allow the government to maintain a neutral stance on the issue, avoiding entanglement in the deeply personal and often contentious aspects of religious belief.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in defining marriage. If the goal is to establish a uniform national standard, it may be more effective to work towards a federal law that addresses the issue, rather than relying on individual state-by-state solutions.\n\nHowever, amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it represents a significant manipulation of the fundamental document. The constitution should be amended only when dealing with matters of grave national importance, and this issue, while significant to some, may not meet that threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the definition of marriage and the government's role in it is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. A more nuanced approach, focusing on the separation of church and state, and recognizing the complexities of the issue, may be more beneficial than imposing a broad, sweeping solution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have navigated the complexities of homosexuality through various perspectives. Having close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of the issue. While I may not personally adhere to the same lifestyle, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding their personal lives.\n\nIn a democratic society, it is essential to respect the autonomy of each state in making decisions that affect its citizens. By decentralizing the decision-making process, we can ensure that each region's values and values-based policies are reflected in their laws. This approach also acknowledges the diverse nature of the country, where different states have different cultural, social, and political landscapes.\n\nMy stance on gay marriage is founded on the principle of equality and individual freedom. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, deserves the same opportunities and rights. The decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to each state, allowing them to align their laws with their unique values and societal norms. This approach promotes inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for diversity.\n\nRegarding the current federal ban on gay marriage, I don't believe it is the president's role to impose a uniform stance across the country. Each state should have the authority to make its own decisions, free from federal interference. This would enable states to adapt to the changing values and needs of their citizens. Moreover, as the president's term is limited, I believe that the decision should be left to the next administration, ensuring a more transparent and democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a decentralized approach to addressing gay marriage, allowing each state to chart its own course. This approach honors the diversity of the country and promotes a more inclusive and respectful society for all individuals.",
            "In reflecting on the issue of school officials monitoring student activity on online platforms like Myspace, I must consider the balance between personal freedom and school safety. On one hand, Myspace is a public forum where users post content for the world to see. If a student shares information on this platform, they should be aware that it may be accessed by not only their peers but also school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety. If monitoring Myspace helps identify potential concerns or issues that could compromise school security, I think it's reasonable for officials to take notice. Even if the content is not posted under the school's name, they may still be able to access it through their own means.\n\nSome might argue that monitoring student online activity is an invasion of privacy. However, I'd like to propose that this perspective is shortsighted. If officials can use this information to prevent harm and create a safer school environment, I don't believe it's an unreasonable intrusion. In fact, I've spoken to a teacher who shared that they perform online monitoring to detect potential issues, such as substance abuse or other illicit activities.\n\nThis is not entirely unlike the lockdown drills we had in my high school, which were implemented in response to concerns about terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to the issue at hand, they demonstrate the school's commitment to ensuring student safety. By monitoring Myspace, officials are essentially taking a similar proactive approach.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in today's digital age, online content can be enduring and far-reaching. A single post or email can resurface years down the line and cause unintended consequences. This reality underscores the importance of responsible online behavior.\n\nUltimately, I believe that school officials have a responsibility to create a safe environment for their students. If monitoring online activity helps them achieve this goal, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of students.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective on the war. Initially, I was convinced that a swift and decisive action was necessary to rectify the situation. However, as I began to consider the potential consequences, I started to question the efficacy of our approach. It became apparent that a more measured and thoughtful strategy was required, taking into account the complexities of the region and the people involved.\n\nUpon reflection, I believe that our actions were motivated by a mix of emotions, including a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency to address the atrocity that had occurred. While I understand the sentiment behind this reaction, I now think that it led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the long-term effects of our intervention.\n\nThe fact that the people in the region are often at odds with one another is a significant factor in the ongoing conflict. It seems that as long as they are preoccupied with internal struggles, they are less likely to pose a threat to us. In this context, I question the value of our presence in the region. Rather than trying to impose our values and customs, we might be better off focusing on our own interests and security.\n\nI also think that we underestimated the cultural and historical context of war in that part of the world. The concept of conflict and violence is deeply ingrained in their society, and it's unrealistic to expect that we can change this overnight. In many ways, their approach to war is shaped by their unique cultural and historical experiences, and it's not necessarily comparable to our own experiences.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were motivated by a desire for revenge and a sense of national pride, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. This led to a hasty and ill-prepared intervention, which ultimately had unintended consequences. We should have taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the local dynamics and the potential outcomes of our actions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we made some progress in the region, I believe that it's time for us to reassess our presence and consider a more measured withdrawal. The reality is that we cannot stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued presence may actually hinder the local population's ability to govern themselves. It's in our best interest to focus on our own security and interests, rather than trying to impose our will on a region that is fundamentally different from our own."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for

be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church faces a challenge in retaining its following due to its stance on certain issues.  One reason for this decline may be the Church's reluctance to adapt to changing societal values.  Specifically, its views on topics such as gay marriage, abortion, and birth control have led to a growing divergence between the Church and its adherents.  While the Church's strong stance on these matters is understandable, its views may be seen as outdated by some.\n\nAs a result, individuals who hold different opinions on these issues may feel uneasy about affiliating with the Church.  For instance, those who support abortion rights or same-sex marriage may find it difficult to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings.  Similarly, the Church's stance on these issues may deter individuals who value inclusivity and diversity.\n\nThe Catholic Church's reluctance to ordain female priests and permit priests to marry is another area of contention.  While some may argue that these changes would not have prevented past controversies, it is worth considering whether greater flexibility in these areas could help the Church stay relevant.  After all, many professionals in other fields balance their work and personal lives, and there is no reason why priests should be held to a different standard.\n\nUltimately, the Catholic Church's stance on these issues may be a major factor in its declining popularity.  By adopting a more inclusive and flexible approach, the Church may be able to reconnect with its followers and attract a new generation of adherents.  However, this would require the Church to re-examine its traditional views and consider the changing values of modern society.",
            "In my opinion, the issue of gay marriage is a complex one. However, I do not believe that individuals have a choice in their sexual orientation. I think it's essential to recognize that people are born with their orientation, and it's not a decision they make consciously.\n\nI also believe that it's unfair to hold someone accountable for their sexual orientation. It's not something they can change, and it's not something they should be judged for. The idea that a couple of the same sex cannot marry while a heterosexual couple can seems discriminatory and unjust.\n\nI think it's essential to separate the issue of gay marriage from the concept of the federal government's involvement. I don't believe that this is a matter of national security or moral obligation, but rather a personal right that individuals should have the freedom to exercise. The government should not interfere with people's lives, especially when it comes to their personal choices and relationships.\n\nIt's crucial to respect people's differences and not judge them based on their orientation. Gay people are not making a choice, and they should not be punished for being who they are. Ultimately, I think the federal government should stay out of this issue, as it's a matter of individual freedom and human rights.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government's involvement in this issue is unwarranted, as it's not a matter of national security or morality. It's essential to recognize that people's sexual orientation is not a choice, and they should be free to live their lives without judgment or persecution.",
            "I firmly believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, not only for the sake of equality but also due to the numerous benefits it would bring to society. The primary argument against it is often based on misconceptions that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families. However, this notion is inherently flawed, as it disregards the diversity and individuality of relationships.\n\nLike two sides of the same coin, heterosexual and homosexual relationships share many commonalities. They both involve commitment, love, and a deep emotional bond. The notion that homosexual couples are inherently different is unfounded, and the legal recognition of their relationships should not be denied.\n\nOne of the critical issues that arise when discussing same-sex marriage is the lack of recognition of partners in times of need. For instance, if a partner is hospitalized, their loved one may be denied visitation rights due to not being considered a family member. This is not only unfair but also highlights the need for equal treatment under the law.\n\nScientific studies have consistently shown that same-sex couples face the same challenges and have the same level of relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts. They are not asking for the right to marry in a church; rather, they seek a legal document that recognizes their commitment to one another.\n\nThe separation of church and state is often cited as a reason for opposing same-sex marriage. However, this argument is misinformed, as the government's role is to provide a legal framework for all citizens, regardless of their religious beliefs. By allowing civil unions, but not marriage, the government is perpetuating a system of \"separate but unequal.\"\n\nThe concerns surrounding adoption and children's well-being are valid, but they are being fueled by misinformation. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents are just as well-adjusted and happy as those raised by heterosexual parents. Additionally, many communities have successfully integrated same-sex families, and schools have implemented inclusive policies to support these families.\n\nThe federal government should take a proactive approach to address this issue by making same-sex marriage legal in all states. The current amendment restricting marriage to heterosexual couples is not only unjust but also hypocritical, given the controversy surrounding the \"Under God\" phrase in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nSome argue that gay people are psychologically damaged or born with a \"defect.\" However, this notion is debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association. It is essential to listen to evidence-based research rather than relying on personal opinions and cultural norms.\n\nBy recognizing the inherent value and worth of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, we can create a more inclusive and just society. It is time for the government to take a stand and ensure that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits and protections as everyone else.",
            "In my experience working at a hospital pharmacy, I've gained a unique perspective on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and societal perceptions. While certain substances are prohibited due to their illicit nature, it's essential to acknowledge their potential benefits. In my opinion, making such substances available to the public without proper regulation would be unwise. However, I firmly believe that their medicinal properties warrant consideration for controlled medical use. The fact that a substance is prohibited doesn't inherently negate its potential advantages.\n\nInterestingly, many controlled substances, such as oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, are commonly used in pharmacies due to their therapeutic value. These substances are subject to strict regulations, but their benefits cannot be denied. If we can accept the legitimacy of these controlled substances, it's equally important to reevaluate the stigma surrounding marijuana. By recognizing its potential benefits, we can work towards a more informed and nuanced understanding of its use.\n\nOne key difference between marijuana and other substances like alcohol lies in their potential for abuse. While excessive use of either substance can lead to negative consequences, it's crucial to acknowledge the distinct risks associated with each. A gradual introduction of marijuana into the mainstream, accompanied by education and regulation, could potentially mitigate abuse and promote responsible use.\n\nThe widespread negative image surrounding marijuana is largely due to its illicit status. However, it's essential to separate fact from fiction and address the misconceptions surrounding this substance. In comparison to more hazardous substances like heroin or cocaine, marijuana's risks are relatively low. By dispelling the myths and misconceptions surrounding marijuana, we can foster a more responsible and informed approach to its use.",
            "The Catholic Church has demonstrated its ability to adapt to the changing times, embracing a more modern and relaxed atmosphere. Gone are the strict traditions of the past, replaced by a more casual and inclusive environment. My personal experiences attending church services have shown a notable shift in the way people dress and interact with one another. What used to be a formal affair has given way to a more laid-back atmosphere, especially during the summer months when people often attend in casual beachwear.\n\nThis change is evident not only in the dress code but also in the overall tone of the services. The introduction of a shorter, 30-minute mass has made it more accessible to those with busy schedules, allowing them to participate in their faith without feeling obligated to adhere to a strict time commitment. The presence of families and children has also become more prominent, which is a positive development in creating a sense of community and belonging.\n\nWhile I am not well-versed in the inner workings of the church's politics, I can speak to the issue of clergy misconduct. In my opinion, the recent scandals surrounding pedophilia within the church are a complex issue with deep-seated causes. I do not believe that allowing priests to marry or ordaining female priests would have been a solution to this problem. Research suggests that pedophilia is a pre-existing condition, often linked to genetic factors, rather than a result of environmental influences. While marriage may provide a sense of fulfillment and stability for some individuals, it is unlikely to alter their inherent tendencies.\n\nIt is essential to acknowledge that clergy misconduct is not exclusive to the Catholic Church, and it is not solely the result of their celibacy or lack thereof. Rather, it is a symptom of a broader societal issue that requires a multifaceted approach to address. If the church or any institution is aware of such misconduct and attempts to cover it up, it is indeed shameful. However, I do not believe that the root cause of this issue lies in the church's policies regarding marriage or ordination.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Catholic Church has made strides in adapting to the modern world, the issue of clergy misconduct is a more complex and deeply ingrained problem that cannot be simply resolved by altering its practices. Ultimately, it requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the underlying causes and promotes a culture of transparency and accountability.",
            "The Iraq war has left a lasting impression on me, and while I initially supported the premise of military action, I have serious concerns about the motivations behind it. Following the September 11th attacks, the Bush administration hastily linked Iraq to the terrorist threat, asserting the existence of weapons of mass destruction – claims that have since been thoroughly discredited. This deliberate misrepresentation of facts has been a source of great frustration for me.\n\nThe administration's propensity for deception is particularly disturbing, especially given the dire consequences. Colin Powell's subsequent admission that he was unconvinced by the evidence he presented to the UN highlights the scope of this issue. I believe that such deliberate falsehoods are a serious breach of the public's trust and an impeachable offense.\n\nFurthermore, the Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution has been alarming, particularly in its attempts to marginalize it since September 11th. It is clear that their intention from the outset was to pursue a war in Iraq.\n\nAccording to reliable sources, including a former treasury secretary, George W. Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein may have been driven in part by a desire to expand the country's energy supply. This underhanded motive has contributed to the ongoing instability in the region.\n\nWhile it is true that a sudden withdrawal from Iraq could lead to civil war and further bloodshed, I believe that the current situation has dragged on for far too long. The proposed solution, a coalition of surrounding nations, may not be the most effective or sustainable approach. Iraq's sovereignty will likely remain a contentious issue, and the current interim government's ineffectiveness has exacerbated the problem.\n\nNews reports indicate that the Iraqi Parliament is struggling to assert its authority, and the Prime Minister's influence is being undermined by radical factions vying for control. This fractious environment has hindered the country's development and is an obstacle to stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the complexities of the Iraq situation are multifaceted and far-reaching. While I can't articulate a clear-cut solution, I firmly believe that the current path is unsustainable, and a more constructive approach is needed to address the ongoing conflict.",
            "One of the most contentious issues of our time is the War in Iraq. I'm not quite sure where to begin, but I'll try to provide some insight into my perspective.\n\nInitially, I felt that the war was somewhat pointless, given that it wasn't officially declared. It seemed to me that the primary motivation was to retaliate against the country perceived to be responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Consequently, I didn't closely follow the developments of the war.\n\nHowever, I've come to understand that our presence in Iraq is largely aimed at establishing democracy and securing oil resources. While this may not be the most compelling reason to continue the war, it's crucial to acknowledge the complexities involved. On one hand, staying in Iraq would allow us to create a stable democracy, albeit a lengthy and challenging process. On the other hand, our prolonged presence could be seen as an attempt to mold Iraq into a replica of the United States, potentially exacerbating the situation.\n\nMoreover, the war has significant humanitarian consequences, including the displacement of children from their families and the disruption of education. It's essential to consider the impact of our actions on the Iraqi people and the potential for the Al-Qaeda insurgency to grow stronger due to our intervention.\n\nI've come to realize that this conflict is not as black-and-white as it seems. As a nation, we must weigh the pros and cons of our involvement and consider the long-term effects on both the Iraqis and ourselves. In my opinion, the war has the potential to become a long and arduous process, with uncertain outcomes.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the lack of congressional declaration has raised questions about the legitimacy of the war. As a nation, we should strive to operate within the bounds of our democratic institutions and respect the principles of our government.\n\nUltimately, the decision to continue or withdraw from Iraq is a complex issue that requires careful consideration of multiple factors. While I'm not an expert on the topic, I believe that our actions should be guided by empathy for the Iraqi people and a commitment to finding a peaceful resolution.",
            "There is a strong argument to be made that government involvement in matters of religious beliefs can be problematic. The constitution's emphasis on the separation of church and state suggests that it is not the role of the government to dictate what is or is not acceptable within religious institutions. This separation has been a cornerstone of religious tolerance in the United States, allowing individuals to practice their faith without fear of government interference.\n\nThe idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices could be seen as contradictory to the principles enshrined in the constitution. Such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, undermining the very foundation of our democratic system. Furthermore, the motivations behind such a move would need to be carefully examined, particularly if they are driven by personal beliefs rather than a genuine concern for the greater good.\n\nIn the context of the proposed amendment, it is essential to consider the potential impact on society. While the economic implications are unclear, it is possible that recognizing and respecting individual freedoms of faith could have a positive effect on the social fabric of our nation. Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed should be left to the churches and their respective congregations, rather than being dictated by government edict.\n\nThe notion that the federal government or any public official should impose their will on matters of faith is concerning, especially when it appears to be driven by personal biases rather than a desire to serve the greater good. By respecting the separation of church and state, we can promote a more inclusive and tolerant society where individuals are free to practice their faith without fear of persecution or reprisal.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of introducing an amendment to restrict certain religious practices is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. While there may be valid concerns, it is essential to prioritize the principles of religious freedom and the separation of church and state, rather than allowing personal agendas to drive policy decisions.",
            "The Iraq War has left a profound impact on the world, sparking intense debates and raising questions about the motivations behind the conflict. In my opinion, the government's initial justification for the invasion was not entirely transparent to the American people. The administration's attempt to link the 9/11 terrorist attacks to the invasion of Iraq was tenuous at best, and it played on the public's emotions to garner support for the war.\n\nAs someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was critical of the invasion from the start. The war in Iraq shares eerie similarities with the Vietnam War, where the government underestimated the complexity of the situation and the challenges of implementing democracy in a foreign country. The removal of Saddam Hussein's regime was a significant challenge, and the US government was not adequately prepared for the power vacuum that ensued.\n\nThe consequences of the war have been dire, with countless American lives lost and ongoing efforts to train the Iraqi military and police forces. The US government's assumption that the invasion would be a swift and successful endeavor was overly optimistic, given the historical precedents of similar conflicts.\n\nIn light of these facts, it is clear that the government's decision-making process was flawed. The Bush administration's claim that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction, which was later proven false, raises concerns about the government's honesty and thoroughness in its decision-making. Furthermore, the fact that countries like North Korea, which were known to possess such weapons, were not the target of similar military actions, suggests a potential motive driven by self-interest rather than a genuine desire to spread democracy.\n\nThe ongoing conflict in Iraq has raised difficult questions about the morality of military intervention and the true motivations behind it. While it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility towards the Iraqi people, who have suffered greatly as a result of the invasion, the human cost of the war cannot be ignored. As the war enters its second decade, it is essential to re-examine the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of our actions.\n\nThe Iraq War has also sparked discussions about the role of oil and resources in international relations. The fact that Iraq is a significant oil producer and the US government's stated reason for the invasion was to spread democracy and remove a \"rogue\" regime, while conveniently overlooking other countries with similar characteristics, raises suspicions about the true motives behind the conflict.\n\nAs the conflict continues, I can only hope that a peaceful resolution is reached, and the Iraqi people can finally find stability and security. However, the path forward is uncertain, and it is essential to acknowledge the complexities and challenges involved in creating a democratic government in a country ravaged by war.",
            "My stance on same-sex marriage has been unwavering throughout my life. I firmly believe that an individual's sexual orientation is a deeply personal aspect of their identity, and it should not be subject to societal or governmental restrictions. Recent scientific research has shed light on the biological factors contributing to an individual's sexual orientation, suggesting that it may not be entirely a matter of upbringing or social conditioning.\n\nIn my opinion, it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marriage based on something that is largely beyond their control. I strongly advocate for the rights of same-sex couples to be recognized and respected.\n\nThe issue here is not about politics or government intervention, but rather about allowing individuals to make their own choices and live their lives as they see fit. I have witnessed firsthand the normalcy of same-sex relationships in my community, where gay couples live and interact with their neighbors just like any other family unit. It's time for our society to acknowledge and accept this reality.\n\nThe concept of marriage should be private and personal, not subject to public scrutiny or governmental regulations. If a heterosexual couple can choose to get married without drawing attention to themselves, why should the same not be true for same-sex couples? It's a matter of equality and respect for individual autonomy.\n\nWhile some may argue that marriage is a social construct, I believe that it is a fundamental human right that should be accessible to all, regardless of one's sexual orientation. By recognizing this, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One of the challenges of online communication is that once you share something on the internet, it becomes a matter of public record. As someone who has experience in a residential advisor role, I've seen firsthand how this can be a concern. When you post something online, it can shape people's opinions about you, and in some cases, it can have serious consequences.\n\nFor instance, if you're discussing sensitive topics like violence or threats, it's likely to attract attention from others. Someone might report it to the authorities or school administrators, who then have to take action. This is because the internet is a publicly accessible space, and any content you post can be seen by a wide audience.\n\nI recall an incident at my school where a student made a comment that was misinterpreted as a threat. An overheard conversation was reported to the authorities, and after investigating, it was discovered that the student had posted something online that was meant as a joke. However, in the context of the situation, it was taken seriously.\n\nThe key point to remember is that once you post something online, you're giving up a level of control over who sees it and how it's perceived. If you don't want people to know something about you, it's best not to post it online. You can't dictate how others will react to what you share, and you can't force them to take it lightly.\n\nWhile I don't think it's appropriate for school officials to be friends with students on social media or monitoring their online activity without consent, if a concern is brought to their attention, they have a responsibility to take action. This is especially true if there's a potential threat to safety.\n\nIn terms of boundaries, I believe it's best for educators to maintain a professional distance from their students online. As an R.A., I don't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to intrude on their personal lives or be privy to information that might create a conflict of interest. By keeping a professional boundary, I can focus on supporting their academic and personal growth without compromising our relationship.",
            "The ongoing conflict has become excessively prolonged, deviating from its original intent. Initially, the objective was to establish democracy in a country plagued by an unfair political system, a goal that warrants consideration. However, over time, the mission seems to have lost its focus, and the driving force behind it appears to have shifted from promoting democracy to showcasing military prowess.\n\nThe motives behind the initial invasion are also suspect, particularly considering the historical tensions between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. While an altruistic aim to establish democracy is understandable, it becomes questionable when personal vendettas are involved.\n\nIn the early stages of the conflict, the war made a significant statement, highlighting the determination to intervene. Nonetheless, the prolonged duration, spanning several years, has led to a protracted and increasingly costly endeavor. It is arguable that the purpose has been undermined, and the war has become a self-perpetuating cycle, driven by the desire to maintain a military presence rather than to achieve a decisive victory.\n\nThe financial burden of this conflict is substantial, diverting billions of dollars from domestic priorities such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, and healthcare. These domestic issues, such as public roads, education, and healthcare, are pressing concerns that require attention and funding. It is imperative to reassess the allocation of resources, prioritizing the needs of our own citizens over the prolonged engagement in a foreign conflict. Ultimately, the war has become a costly and seemingly futile endeavor, draining our economy and diverting attention from pressing domestic issues.",
            "When considering whether a student's online profile or activity can be monitored to prevent harm, several factors come into play. For instance, social media platforms like Myspace often require users to allow others to access their profiles by accepting them as friends or acquaintances. In doing so, individuals essentially grant permission for those individuals to view their personal information.\n\nThis raises questions about the extent to which online activity can be traced and monitored. While it's impossible to have a single person continuously monitor every student's online presence, it's also not feasible to simply block certain individuals from accessing the internet. Instead, schools might consider implementing guidelines or policies regarding online safety and responsible behavior.\n\nSome argue that schools have a responsibility to protect students from potential harm, particularly if they have reason to believe that a student may be in danger. In this context, monitoring online activity might be justified. However, this raises issues of privacy and potential discrimination. Schools would need to carefully weigh the benefits of monitoring against the potential risks and ensure that any policies are fair and applied consistently.\n\nThe boundaries between personal and public spaces online are increasingly blurred. Platforms like Myspace and Facebook expose users to a wide audience, and individuals may share personal information without fully realizing its accessibility. This can be concerning, especially considering the ease with which strangers can gather information about others online.\n\nA notable example of this vulnerability can be seen in cases where individuals have used social media to gather sensitive information about others. For instance, a recent television program demonstrated how a person was able to gather a stranger's screen name and establish contact through instant messaging. While this is an extreme example, it highlights the importance of being cautious when sharing personal details online.\n\nMany students, including myself, have Myspace profiles to connect with friends and maintain social relationships. However, this also means that we must navigate the risks associated with online sharing. It's essential to strike a balance between opening ourselves up to others and protecting our personal information.\n\nIn some cases, schools may restrict access to social media platforms, as was the case in my roommate's high school. While this may seem like an overreach, it also raises important questions about the boundaries between school and personal life. I'm not sure whether it's a matter of privacy or authority, but it's certainly a complex issue.\n\nOverall, the intersection of online safety, privacy, and responsibility is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration.",
            "The Iraq War remains a contentious topic, and it's difficult to approach the subject without acknowledging the complex web of opinions surrounding it. As someone who has grappled with the nuances of this issue, I find myself reflecting on the overwhelming consensus that the war was a misguided endeavor. The vast majority of global polls, including those conducted in the United States, Iraq, and internationally, suggest that upwards of 75-80% of the population believes the war was a miscalculation.\n\nThis sentiment is also echoed by a significant portion of the US military personnel currently stationed in Iraq, with around 70% expressing the opinion that the war was a mistake and that withdrawal within the year is the most prudent course of action. The fact that the war has been widely regarded as a disaster from its inception, with no clear path forward for a successful exit, highlights the enormity of the challenge.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for this debacle is the profound cultural divide between the US and Middle Eastern nations. The idea that democracy can be imposed on a region with such a distinct cultural identity is a notion that has been repeatedly proven flawed. The previous administration's decision to invade Iraq was based on a simplistic understanding of the local context, which overlooked the complexities of the region.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrannical leader, any evaluation of the war's justification requires a balanced consideration of the potential consequences. The catastrophic outcome that unfolded was predictable, and it's essential to acknowledge that the war was not a well-thought-out decision.\n\nAs the situation in Iraq continues to unfold, it's becoming increasingly clear that there is no compelling argument to justify an extended US presence. The administration's suggestions for a gradual withdrawal over a year or more may be a step in the right direction, but the fundamental question remains: what is the purpose of our continued involvement? The voices of the Iraqi people, who have consistently expressed a desire for our departure, should be given significant weight in this decision. It's time to listen to their perspective and recognize that they may possess a deeper understanding of their own situation.\n\nUltimately, if we were to ask the Iraqi people whether they want us to leave, and they respond with a resounding \"yes,\" it would provide a clear justification for our exit. This approach would also absolve us of any potential blame for the consequences of our departure. If we were to decide to assist the Iraqi people after we leave, we could at least do so in a position of moral clarity, rather than being seen as occupying forces.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complicated and multifaceted issue, and it's essential to approach it with a nuanced understanding of the complexities involved. While there are valid arguments on both sides, the overwhelming evidence suggests that our continued involvement is no longer justified. It's time for us to listen to the voices of the Iraqi people and to reevaluate our role in this conflict.",
            "Gender inequality remains a pressing issue in the United States, particularly in certain professional settings. It's not limited to women, as various fields, including the corporate world, fashion, and even parenting, exhibit inherent biases. The \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women face obstacles in advancing to leadership positions, is a notable example. \n\nWhile societal norms have evolved over time, deeply ingrained attitudes persist. Women are often held to a higher standard, with their professional abilities being scrutinized more closely than men's. Conversely, men who choose to stay at home to raise their children face stigma, as people often expect them to be the primary breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who are passionate about fashion may be perceived as less credible due to traditional stereotypes. This can be overcome by highlighting the qualities and expertise of individuals who defy these expectations. A gradual shift in societal attitudes is underway, with more people accepting women in leadership roles and stay-at-home dads. However, promoting this change requires a delicate approach, as forced efforts can lead to resistance.\n\nFurthermore, socioeconomic factors can also contribute to inequality. Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, regardless of gender, may face prejudice based on their educational background or communication skills. For instance, a CEO from a rural area with limited formal education may be judged on their ability to articulate their thoughts, rather than their intelligence or business acumen.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that inequality is not limited to gender; various factors, including socioeconomic status and geographical background, can also contribute to prejudice. Addressing these issues requires a nuanced approach, acknowledging the complexities of societal attitudes and the need for gradual change.",
            "There seems to be a shift in the way the law addresses marijuana possession, from treating it as a criminal offense to a more minor infraction akin to a traffic citation. This change is significant, as it spares individuals from the more severe consequences associated with a criminal charge, such as arrest and court appearances. However, the long-term implications of a decriminalized marijuana policy can still be a concern for those who worry about its impact on their future, particularly in the context of employment and other professional opportunities.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of decriminalization is that it can help alleviate the financial burden on local law enforcement and the judicial system. The process of arresting, booking, and prosecuting individuals for marijuana possession can be resource-intensive and costly. By reducing the number of arrests and court appearances, municipalities can redirect these resources to more pressing community needs, such as public education, social programs, and support services for vulnerable populations.\n\nDenver's approach to marijuana decriminalization is a notable example of this strategy. By removing the stigma associated with marijuana possession, the city has been able to free up resources for more constructive purposes. This is particularly relevant in areas where communities have traditionally been skeptical of marijuana use.\n\nWhile there are valid concerns about the potential consequences of widespread marijuana use, such as increased accidents and public health issues, it's essential to consider the complexities of individual reactions to the substance. People's responses to marijuana can vary greatly, and some may be more susceptible to its effects than others. Moreover, attitudes towards marijuana use are often influenced by cultural and personal factors, making it challenging to generalize its impact.\n\nUltimately, the decision to decriminalize marijuana is a multifaceted issue that requires a nuanced understanding of its potential benefits and drawbacks. By considering the financial, social, and individual implications, we can work towards a more informed and evidence-based approach to marijuana policy.",
            "While I acknowledge the importance of tradition in many aspects of the Catholic Church, I also believe that a balance between preserving heritage and embracing change is crucial. The Church's adherence to long-standing practices can be beneficial, as it provides a sense of continuity and stability. However, it's equally essential to adapt to evolving societal norms and values.\n\nOne aspect that has always puzzled me is the perceived disconnect between Catholic doctrine and its application. On one hand, the Church emphasizes the importance of loving and accepting others, as seen in its teachings on tolerance and compassion. On the other hand, certain practices, such as excluding individuals from the community due to their religious background or perceived imperfections, seem to contradict this message.\n\nA personal experience that illustrates this point is my parents' situation. As an Episcopalian, my father was not eligible for a Catholic ceremony, despite my mother's Catholic faith and my own upbringing in the Catholic Church. This incident highlights the tension between the Church's ideals of acceptance and its more rigid practices.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I think it's essential to consider the potential impact on the institution. While some may argue that allowing priests to marry could alleviate certain problems, such as pedophilia, I'm not convinced that this would be a solution. The complexities of human behavior are multifaceted, and individuals who engage in such reprehensible actions are likely driven by factors beyond their marital status.\n\nUltimately, I believe that the Catholic Church should strive to reconcile its doctrine with its practices, promoting a more inclusive and compassionate environment for all members of the community.",
            "The issue of church and state separation is especially challenging when considering the definition of marriage. Balancing the involvement of the government in this matter can be delicate, as it involves determining the extent to which a personal, deeply held institution should be regulated by the state. The government's role in recognizing and defining marriage is a complex issue that must be approached with sensitivity.\n\nOne possible approach is to consider the distinction between civil unions and marriage. In this context, marriage is seen as a sacrament or a deeply personal commitment between two individuals, rather than a solely governmental concern. This perspective suggests that the government's role should be limited to recognizing and enforcing the legal aspects of a union, rather than imposing its own definition of what constitutes a valid marriage.\n\nIf the primary focus is on the legal rights and benefits associated with marriage, then perhaps it would be more practical to view it as a civil union. This approach would allow the government to maintain a neutral stance on the issue, avoiding entanglement in the deeply personal and often contentious aspects of religious belief.\n\nRegarding the topic of gay marriage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of government involvement in defining marriage. If the goal is to establish a uniform national standard, it may be more effective to work towards a federal law that addresses the issue, rather than relying on individual state-by-state solutions.\n\nHowever, amending the constitution to prohibit gay marriage seems unwarranted, as it represents a significant manipulation of the fundamental document. The constitution should be amended only when dealing with matters of grave national importance, and this issue, while significant to some, may not meet that threshold.\n\nIn conclusion, the definition of marriage and the government's role in it is a multifaceted issue that requires careful consideration. A more nuanced approach, focusing on the separation of church and state, and recognizing the complexities of the issue, may be more beneficial than imposing a broad, sweeping solution.",
            "Growing up in a Christian household, I have navigated the complexities of homosexuality through various perspectives. Having close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to develop a nuanced understanding of the issue. While I may not personally adhere to the same lifestyle, I believe that individuals should be free to make their own choices regarding their personal lives.\n\nIn a democratic society, it is essential to respect the autonomy of each state in making decisions that affect its citizens. By decentralizing the decision-making process, we can ensure that each region's values and values-based policies are reflected in their laws. This approach also acknowledges the diverse nature of the country, where different states have different cultural, social, and political landscapes.\n\nMy stance on gay marriage is founded on the principle of equality and individual freedom. I believe everyone, regardless of their orientation, deserves the same opportunities and rights. The decision to legalize gay marriage should be left to each state, allowing them to align their laws with their unique values and societal norms. This approach promotes inclusivity, tolerance, and respect for diversity.\n\nRegarding the current federal ban on gay marriage, I don't believe it is the president's role to impose a uniform stance across the country. Each state should have the authority to make its own decisions, free from federal interference. This would enable states to adapt to the changing values and needs of their citizens. Moreover, as the president's term is limited, I believe that the decision should be left to the next administration, ensuring a more transparent and democratic process.\n\nIn conclusion, I advocate for a decentralized approach to addressing gay marriage, allowing each state to chart its own course. This approach honors the diversity of the country and promotes a more inclusive and respectful society for all individuals.",
            "In reflecting on the issue of school officials monitoring student activity on online platforms like Myspace, I must consider the balance between personal freedom and school safety. On one hand, Myspace is a public forum where users post content for the world to see. If a student shares information on this platform, they should be aware that it may be accessed by not only their peers but also school officials.\n\nIn the context of preventing a school shooting, I believe that officials have a responsibility to take proactive measures to ensure student safety. If monitoring Myspace helps identify potential concerns or issues that could compromise school security, I think it's reasonable for officials to take notice. Even if the content is not posted under the school's name, they may still be able to access it through their own means.\n\nSome might argue that monitoring student online activity is an invasion of privacy. However, I'd like to propose that this perspective is shortsighted. If officials can use this information to prevent harm and create a safer school environment, I don't believe it's an unreasonable intrusion. In fact, I've spoken to a teacher who shared that they perform online monitoring to detect potential issues, such as substance abuse or other illicit activities.\n\nThis is not entirely unlike the lockdown drills we had in my high school, which were implemented in response to concerns about terrorist attacks. While these drills may seem unrelated to the issue at hand, they demonstrate the school's commitment to ensuring student safety. By monitoring Myspace, officials are essentially taking a similar proactive approach.\n\nIt's worth noting that, in today's digital age, online content can be enduring and far-reaching. A single post or email can resurface years down the line and cause unintended consequences. This reality underscores the importance of responsible online behavior.\n\nUltimately, I believe that school officials have a responsibility to create a safe environment for their students. If monitoring online activity helps them achieve this goal, I don't think it's an invasion of privacy. In fact, it's a necessary measure to ensure the well-being of students.",
            "The events of 9/11 had a profound impact on my perspective on the war. Initially, I was convinced that a swift and decisive action was necessary to rectify the situation. However, as I began to consider the potential consequences, I started to question the efficacy of our approach. It became apparent that a more measured and thoughtful strategy was required, taking into account the complexities of the region and the people involved.\n\nUpon reflection, I believe that our actions were motivated by a mix of emotions, including a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency to address the atrocity that had occurred. While I understand the sentiment behind this reaction, I now think that it led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the long-term effects of our intervention.\n\nThe fact that the people in the region are often at odds with one another is a significant factor in the ongoing conflict. It seems that as long as they are preoccupied with internal struggles, they are less likely to pose a threat to us. In this context, I question the value of our presence in the region. Rather than trying to impose our values and customs, we might be better off focusing on our own interests and security.\n\nI also think that we underestimated the cultural and historical context of war in that part of the world. The concept of conflict and violence is deeply ingrained in their society, and it's unrealistic to expect that we can change this overnight. In many ways, their approach to war is shaped by their unique cultural and historical experiences, and it's not necessarily comparable to our own experiences.\n\nIn retrospect, I think we were motivated by a desire for revenge and a sense of national pride, rather than a well-thought-out strategy. This led to a hasty and ill-prepared intervention, which ultimately had unintended consequences. We should have taken a more nuanced approach, one that considered the local dynamics and the potential outcomes of our actions.\n\nWhile I acknowledge that we made some progress in the region, I believe that it's time for us to reassess our presence and consider a more measured withdrawal. The reality is that we cannot stay in the region indefinitely, and our continued presence may actually hinder the local population's ability to govern themselves. It's in our best interest to focus on our own security and interests, rather than trying to impose our will on a region that is fundamentally different from our own."
