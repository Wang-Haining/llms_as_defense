            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church's views on certain issues may be contributing to its declining membership. While it's natural for institutions to hold strong convictions, their stance on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control may be perceived as outdated by some. This perceived rigidity can lead individuals to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable within the Church.\n\nFor instance, when a person holds a different viewpoint on abortion or gay marriage, they may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and potentially even alienate individuals from the faith. Essentially, the Church's stance on these issues may be driving people away.\n\nOne potential area for reform is in the Church's stance on female priests and married clergy. Some may argue that these changes could help the Church become more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience. However, it's challenging to predict the outcome, as human behavior is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Church's teachings on devotion and commitment are rooted in the idea that priests are married to God. This notion suggests that priests are expected to prioritize their spiritual duties above all else. Nevertheless, the idea that clergy cannot have a family life or personal relationships is not unique to the Church. Many individuals in various professions lead double lives, balancing their professional and personal responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's stance on certain issues and its stance on female priests and married clergy may be contributing to its declining membership. While some may view these stances as outdated, others may see them as essential to the Church's identity. Ultimately, the relationship between the Church and its members is complex and influenced by various factors.",
            "In my opinion, the idea that people's sexual orientation is solely a matter of personal choice is not a stance I subscribe to. I believe that individuals are born with their inherent nature, and it's not something that can be altered through conscious decision-making. This perspective leads me to think that it's unfair to hold people responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize that people's identities are not something they can change at will. For instance, while some individuals are born with a heterosexual inclination, others are born with a same-sex attraction. It's crucial to acknowledge that these are natural variations and not something that can be willfully chosen.\n\nWhen it comes to marriage, I believe that the federal government should not have a say in who individuals can marry. The issue is not a matter of national security or morality; it's a personal matter between two consenting adults. It's not the government's place to dictate who can form a union and who cannot.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people's sexual orientation is not a decision they made, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's essential to respect individuals for who they are and allow them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution.\n\nUltimately, I think it's crucial to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The government should not have the authority to interfere with personal relationships or dictate who can love whom.",
            "The notion of gay marriage legalization has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I firmly believe that this perspective is misguided. Essentially, the two are fundamentally different yet intertwined concepts that cannot be compared directly. The issue is often oversimplified, neglecting the multifaceted aspects that make relationships unique.\n\nOne oft-cited concern is the perceived impact on heterosexual families. However, this argument is based on an oversimplified understanding of the complexities involved. Studies have consistently shown that homosexual couples exhibit similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the fact that homosexual couples are not seeking to obtain a church-sanctioned marriage, but rather a legally recognized union provided by the government. If we separate church and state, the question of moral opposition becomes irrelevant. The provision of a marriage certificate should not be contingent upon the approval of a particular religious group.\n\nIn fact, the lack of equal rights for homosexual couples can be likened to a form of segregation. The notion that they are denied a fundamental right while others enjoy it is a clear infringement on their civil liberties.\n\nConcerns surrounding adoption, community integration, and the impact on children of gay couples are often cited as reasons to oppose gay marriage. However, these concerns are often based on unsubstantiated fears and biases. In reality, children raised by gay parents are not inherently disadvantaged, and their well-being is not predetermined by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nThe phenomenon of bullying and societal pressure faced by children of gay parents is a pressing issue that demands attention and action. Rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes, we should focus on creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.\n\nRegarding the role of government in this issue, I firmly believe that the federal government should play a more proactive role in ensuring the equality of all citizens. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only misguided but also hypocritical, given the government's stance on other issues such as the separation of church and state.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that gay couples are somehow flawed or damaged is a baseless stereotype that has been thoroughly debunked by reputable institutions. By ignoring the scientific consensus and instead relying on anecdotal evidence and personal biases, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and fear. It is time for us to reevaluate our stance on this issue and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One aspect of my summer experience at the hospital pharmacy has led me to consider the multifaceted nature of controlled substances. While certain medications may be prohibited, they continue to demonstrate significant therapeutic potential. In the context of public accessibility, I believe that such substances should not be made readily available. However, their use in medical settings is a different matter. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily negate its benefits.\n\nAs a pharmacy professional, I've seen firsthand the controlled use of substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse. Despite their illicit status, these medications are instrumental in alleviating pain and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, the medicinal properties of marijuana should be acknowledged and respected, rather than being dismissed due to societal stigma.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is not entirely apt, as marijuana's risks are distinct from those associated with excessive drinking. While both substances can be misused, their impacts differ significantly. A more nuanced approach to marijuana regulation would involve a gradual integration into mainstream society, accompanied by education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana is deeply ingrained, largely due to its classification as an illicit substance. However, this image is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of marijuana's risks and benefits. In fact, it's not as hazardous as other Schedule I substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the societal stigma surrounding marijuana, we can begin to view it as a legitimate treatment option, rather than a taboo.\n\nUltimately, a more informed and balanced perspective on marijuana is necessary, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and risks. By doing so, we can work towards a more responsible and evidence-based approach to its use and regulation.",
            "The Catholic Church has undergone significant transformations in recent years to adapt to the changing times. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms. As someone who has been involved with the church their whole life, I've witnessed firsthand the shift towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere. Even within my own experiences, I've noticed a change in the way people dress and engage with the church community.\n\nGrowing up, attending church on Sundays was a regular occurrence, and I would often get dressed up in my finest attire. However, that's no longer the case. The introduction of a shorter Teen Mass has made Sundays more accessible and relaxed, with attendees often wearing casual clothing, even jeans and khakis. This change is particularly noticeable during the warmer months when beachwear is a common sight.\n\nWhile I'm not well-versed in the church's internal politics, one thing is clear: the focus has shifted towards a more casual and welcoming environment. As for the accusations of pedophilia, I believe that these issues are complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I'm not convinced that this would have been the case. Research suggests that pedophilia is a deeply ingrained trait, often rooted in genetics. It's not something that can be easily addressed through changes in the church's policies or practices.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that individuals who are predisposed to pedophilia are unlikely to change their behavior, regardless of their marital status or religious affiliation. While it's essential to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing, I don't believe that the church's policies are to blame for these heinous crimes. Rather, it's the actions of individuals that have caused harm, and it's crucial to address these issues through education, support, and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's evolution towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere is a positive development, but it's essential to separate this from the complex issues surrounding pedophilia. By acknowledging the root causes of these problems and addressing them through a comprehensive approach, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive community for all.",
            "Upon reflection, I have come to realize that the premise we were initially considering had significant implications stemming from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration leveraged a complex series of events and pretexts to justify the invasion of Iraq, which ultimately led to the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, it has since been established that these claims were unfounded.\n\nI strongly believe that the Bush administration's actions and subsequent lack of accountability for these misrepresentations have been particularly egregious. Notably, Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, has since acknowledged his own doubts about the evidence presented at the time of the UN presentation. This demonstrates a disturbing disregard for truth and accountability, which I argue constitutes a serious breach of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions suggest a concerning disregard for the US Constitution and the principles it upholds. Since September 11th, I have witnessed a persistent attempt to marginalize key provisions of the Constitution, which has only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt is my understanding that the younger Bush had a pre-existing agenda to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy, which was motivated in part by his father's past experiences. This agenda may have been driven by a desire to secure access to new energy resources, a goal that is both ambitious and potentially problematic.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the complexities of the situation, I believe that the conflict has endured for far too long. A hasty withdrawal could lead to destabilization and increased bloodshed, potentially plunging the country into civil war. Alternatively, the proposed coalition of regional nations, which includes Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be a viable solution, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create long-term instability.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that the interim government is failing to assert its authority, with the Parliament struggling to establish a cohesive leadership and the Prime Minister lacking control. The influence of radical elements, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, is also contributing to the fractious nature of the political process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I struggle to articulate a clear solution, I firmly believe that the Bush administration's actions have been deeply problematic and that the situation in Iraq remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",
            "Upon reflection, I have mixed feelings regarding the War in Iraq. Initially, I was unsure of where to begin, but it became apparent that a declared war by Congress is a crucial factor in my opinion. Without such a declaration, the conflict seems more like a retaliatory measure in response to the 9/11 attacks. While I don't feel well-versed in the intricacies of the conflict, I understand that our presence in Iraq is aimed at establishing a democratic government and securing resources.\n\nHowever, this approach raises concerns about the feasibility and morality of our involvement. The prolonged duration of the war has led to widespread resentment and instability in the region. Moreover, the difficulty in establishing democracy in a foreign context is a daunting task, and our continued presence may only exacerbate the situation.\n\nOne argument in favor of continuing the war is the concern for the families of service members stationed in Iraq. It is essential to consider the human cost and the impact on the local population. Nevertheless, this perspective is overshadowed by the risk of cultural insensitivity and the potential for our actions to be perceived as an attempt to impose our values on another nation.\n\nA more nuanced approach might be to reevaluate our role in the conflict and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. The ongoing occupation has already led to the growth of extremist groups and increased hostility towards the United States. In light of this, it seems that our continued presence may ultimately be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, the War in Iraq is a complex issue, and my opinion is that it would be beneficial to reassess our involvement and consider a more measured approach. This would allow us to address the root causes of the conflict while minimizing the harm caused to the local population and our own nation.",
            "There are legitimate concerns regarding the government's involvement in declaring something as legal or illegal, particularly when it comes to matters of religious freedom. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it's essential to uphold this principle.\n\nWhen considering the potential for an amendment that restricts certain religious practices, it's crucial to examine the motivations behind this initiative. One must question whether the government is attempting to impose its will on a particular group, rather than allowing for religious tolerance and diversity.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the Constitution since its inception, fostering a culture of religious freedom in the United States. Proposing an amendment that would restrict this freedom would be counterintuitive and contradictory to the founding principles of the nation. Furthermore, such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, which raises significant concerns.\n\nThe government should refrain from intervening in matters of religious practice, as this would be an overreach of authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of religious groups. The president's personal beliefs, as a Catholic, do not provide a sufficient justification for proposing an amendment that discriminates against other faiths. Any decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities directly affected, rather than being imposed by the government.\n\nWhile some may argue that an amendment is necessary to address a perceived issue, a closer examination reveals that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that this amendment would have a positive impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that such an amendment could have unintended consequences, including stifling religious diversity and freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should not be involved in declaring certain religious practices as illegal, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the principles of separation of church and state. The decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities, rather than being imposed by the government.",
            "The Iraq War remains a highly debated topic, with many questioning the motives behind the United States' decision to invade the country in 2003. I firmly believe that the government's initial justifications for the war were not entirely transparent, and that the connection between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that the government played on the emotions of the American people, capitalizing on their outrage following the terrorist attacks of 2001. This led to a lack of critical evaluation of the potential consequences of invading Iraq. As someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was skeptical of the decision from the outset.\n\nThe parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking. Both conflicts involve attempts to impose democracy on foreign nations, often with disastrous results. The removal of the Iraqi government and the subsequent power vacuum led to chaos and instability, which the US was not adequately prepared to handle. This echoes the lessons of Vietnam, where the US struggled to establish a stable government and ultimately withdrew.\n\nThe war has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, with many soldiers continuing to die in a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The US government underestimated the complexity of rebuilding a nation and establishing a functioning democracy. This is a process that requires time, effort, and resources, as exemplified by the struggles our own country faced in its transition to democracy.\n\nMoreover, the US government's decision to invade Iraq raises questions about its motivations. While the stated goal was to promote democracy, many believe that the primary driver was access to Iraq's oil reserves. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, coupled with the fact that the US has not taken similar action against other nations with similar capabilities, such as North Korea, further fuels these suspicions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to go to war in Iraq was likely based on a mix of factors, including a desire to expand US influence and secure access to valuable resources. As the conflict continues to drag on, it is essential to re-evaluate the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was torn between supporting the incumbent, George Bush, and opposing the war. While I initially believed that allowing him to complete his term was the right decision, the ongoing conflict and the continued loss of American lives have made me question this stance. The war has become a protracted and complex issue, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to invest significant resources in the conflict, it is essential to consider the human cost and the potential long-term benefits of a US withdrawal.",
            "I would like to express my support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. My stance on this issue has been consistent throughout my life, and I firmly believe that marriage is a personal preference that should not be dictated by societal norms or external factors.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the possibility that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological factors, rather than solely by societal conditioning. This realization has led me to reconsider the notion that individuals should be denied rights based on their sexual orientation, which is often beyond their control.\n\nI believe that it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marry based on their sexual orientation, and I have always been an advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the role of government and politics should be limited to protecting individual rights, rather than imposing moral or societal values.\n\nIn my community, I have observed that same-sex couples function just like any other family unit, participating in everyday activities and contributing to their communities. It is disconcerting to see politicians attempting to redefine the concept of marriage to suit their own values, rather than respecting the diversity of human relationships.\n\nResearch suggests that sexual orientation may be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than purely by societal upbringing. This understanding has led me to question the notion that same-sex attraction is a choice, and to recognize the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage is a personal matter that should be between the individuals involved, rather than a public or political issue. Just as individuals are free to get married without public fanfare, same-sex couples should have the same right to enter into a committed partnership without fear of public scrutiny or judgment.",
            "There are certain expectations that come with posting content online. Once something is published on the internet, it becomes a public forum that anyone can access. As someone who has experience with this in a residential setting, I can attest to the fact that online activities can significantly impact how people perceive individuals.\n\nWhen discussing sensitive topics such as violence or threats, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of sharing them online. What may seem like a joke or a harmless comment to the poster can be misconstrued by others, potentially leading to serious repercussions.\n\nIn a school setting, if a student posts something alarming, it's not uncommon for school officials to investigate the situation further. This is often done to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff. While it's essential to respect students' online privacy, there are instances where school administrators may need to intervene.\n\nFor example, if a student posts something that raises concerns about their mental health or intentions, it's the school's responsibility to address the situation. This can be done without infringing on the student's privacy, as the information was shared publicly. However, it's also crucial to note that not all online activity warrants intervention.\n\nSchool officials should not engage in excessive monitoring of students' online activities, such as friending them on social media or tracking their phone conversations. If concerns are brought to their attention, it's essential to handle them in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nA similar principle applies to residential advisors like myself. While it's not necessary to be friends with residents on social media, we must be prepared to address any issues that arise from their online activity. This can be a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that once something is posted online, it's accessible to a wide audience. If you don't want certain information to be shared or don't want people to form a particular opinion about you, it's best to exercise caution when posting online.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its original purpose. Initially, the intention was to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, a goal that I believe is noble. However, over time, I fear that the primary motivation has shifted from a desire to promote democracy to a demonstration of military prowess.\n\nLooking back, I think the initial invasion was a powerful statement in itself, sending a clear message about our commitment to democracy. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict has raised concerns about the true reasons behind our involvement. If the primary objective was to establish democracy, it's likely that our efforts would have been more focused and decisive. Instead, it appears that we have become bogged down in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.\n\nIn my opinion, our original motivation was admirable, but it has been compromised by personal and ulterior motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. This has led to a war that has become increasingly complex and difficult to justify.\n\nI believe that we have already achieved a significant portion of our goals in the initial stages of the conflict. It's time to reassess our priorities and acknowledge that our continued involvement is no longer justifiable. The war has drained our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. As a result, I strongly believe that it's time to bring our troops home and allow the country to take ownership of its future.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that war should not be a long-term expenditure in our budget. We have pressing domestic concerns that require attention and funding, such as maintaining public roads, improving education, and providing quality healthcare. The financial burdens of this war have come at a high cost, including the loss of American lives and the erosion of our national funds. It's time for a change in direction and a renewed focus on our own nation's needs.",
            "The question of balancing online privacy with potential consequences is a complex one. If an individual shares personal information on a social networking site, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, users must accept friend requests from others to view their profiles, thereby granting permission to access their content. This understanding is crucial when contributing to online communities.\n\nHowever, the idea of monitoring students' online profiles to prevent potential harm raises concerns. While it may be possible for someone to stumble upon potentially problematic information, it's impractical and potentially discriminatory to have someone dedicated to scrutinizing individual profiles. The decision to monitor should be based on specific circumstances, such as evidence of suspicious behavior, rather than a general policy.\n\nMy personal experience with social media has taught me to be cautious about sharing personal information. Although I don't maintain a Myspace profile, I do have a Facebook account, and I'm aware of the risks associated with online interactions. A documentary I watched highlighted the ease with which an individual can gather information from social media profiles, which can be used to manipulate others. This has led me to limit the information I share online, while still allowing me to maintain connections with friends.\n\nHowever, I've also come to realize that it's difficult to control who has access to our online presence. Even with privacy settings in place, there's still a risk that others can view our information. This is why I'm careful about accepting friend requests and limit the amount of personal data I share.\n\nA recent conversation with my roommate about her high school experience shed light on the issue of school administrators banning students from using Myspace. While I'm not entirely sure about the reasoning behind this decision, it did raise questions about the extent of authority schools have over students' online activities.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between online privacy and potential consequences is a delicate one. While it's essential to be mindful of the information we share online, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of blanket policies aimed at monitoring students' online activities.",
            "The Iraq War has been a highly debated topic, with various perspectives emerging over time. Initially, many people, including myself, expressed opposition to the invasion. However, as the situation has evolved, the general consensus worldwide has shifted towards viewing the war as a regrettable decision. This is evident in the overwhelming majority of global polls, which suggest that approximately 75-80% of the international community, including a significant percentage of Iraqi citizens and US troops stationed in Iraq, consider the war to have been a mistake.\n\nThe complexities of the Middle East and the cultural differences between Western and Middle Eastern societies can make it challenging to implement successful democratic reforms. The notion that a foreign power can impose its values and governance structures on a region with a distinct history and cultural identity is a notion that has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly problematic, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking military action, particularly when the outcome is uncertain. The rapid escalation of the situation has led to a prolonged and arduous conflict, with numerous challenges and obstacles hindering a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering the prevailing sentiment among the Iraqi population and the international community, it is worth considering the possibility of a gradual withdrawal of US forces over the course of a year or more. This approach would allow for a more measured exit strategy while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences. Notably, a significant portion of Iraqis advocate for an immediate withdrawal, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the current presence.\n\nThe notion that the Iraqi people's decisions should be taken into account is a valid one. If they are telling us to leave, it is essential to consider their perspective and assess the situation objectively. Ultimately, if we were to withdraw and the situation were to deteriorate, we could argue that we had given the Iraqi people the opportunity to make their own decisions and that any negative outcomes would be a result of their choices, not ours.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War has been a multifaceted and intricate issue, with various stakeholders holding different views on its legitimacy and effectiveness. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it seems that a gradual withdrawal of US forces, potentially followed by international assistance, could be a more viable and responsible approach.",
            "One of the most pressing issues in the United States today is the persistence of gender discrimination. While progress has been made in recent years, it remains a significant hurdle in various industries. I firmly believe that societal attitudes and expectations play a substantial role in perpetuating this issue. For instance, in the corporate world, women often face barriers to advancement due to the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where despite having the necessary qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions in favor of male candidates.\n\nThis is not to say that men are immune to discrimination; on the contrary, they too can face difficulties in fields such as fashion, where traditional stereotypes can make it challenging for men to be taken seriously. The notion that men who are interested in fashion are somehow less masculine or less capable can be a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations around caregiving roles can also perpetuate gender discrimination. The stigma surrounding men who stay at home to care for their children is still prevalent, with many people viewing it as unconventional or even unnatural. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for stay-at-home dads, who are often judged for prioritizing family responsibilities over professional ambitions.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where traditional gender roles can be limiting. Men who work in fashion may be subject to skepticism simply because of their gender, with some people questioning their understanding of the industry.\n\nHowever, there are signs that attitudes are slowly shifting. As more women take on leadership roles and break down barriers in the corporate world, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, it is becoming clearer that traditional gender roles are no longer the only standard. By promoting the qualities and achievements of individuals who deviate from these norms, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that discrimination can take many forms, and individuals from different backgrounds may face unique challenges. For example, someone from a rural area may face bias due to their accent or lack of formal education, despite being intelligent and capable. Similarly, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may face prejudice based on their language or customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in addressing gender discrimination in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and working towards greater understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.",
            "My understanding is that while marijuana has not been fully legalized, it has undergone decriminalization, which has downgraded it from a criminal offense to a more akin to a traffic citation. This change involves a less severe outcome, such as receiving a fine rather than facing arrest, booking, and prosecution. Consequently, individuals cited for marijuana possession or use may face fewer consequences in the long run, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications, which can be detrimental to one's future.\n\nHowever, there are varying perspectives on the matter. On one hand, decriminalization can be economically advantageous for municipalities, as it reduces the costs associated with law enforcement, court proceedings, and public defense. This can be a significant concern for financially strained cities, making it a difficult decision to make. In contrast, some communities may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to philosophical or cultural opposition to marijuana.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, has taken a different approach, and it appears to have benefited from the change. As a result, they have redirected funds toward public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. This shift is a significant step forward, especially considering the economic constraints that many municipalities face.\n\nIt is essential to consider the potential consequences of full legalization, as it could lead to increased availability and visibility of marijuana. This might result in a rise in smoking-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. Moreover, societal norms and stigma surrounding marijuana use still exist, making it a sensitive topic in many contexts.\n\nInterestingly, while marijuana's effects on motor skills are not as pronounced as those of alcohol, its impact on lifestyle can be more profound for some individuals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that people react differently to substances, and personal characteristics, such as moderation and self-control, play a significant role in determining the outcome. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, making it challenging to generalize their impact on individuals.",
            "I believe that the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the institution has a rich history and a set of guiding principles that have been upheld for centuries. However, this steadfast commitment to tradition can sometimes make it difficult for the Church to adapt to changing times and circumstances.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this dilemma is the Church's stance on interfaith marriage. My own family's experience with this issue serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of a rigid adherence to doctrine. My parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in the Catholic Church because of the Church's refusal to accept my father's Episcopalian faith.\n\nThis experience has led me to wonder whether the Church's doctrine of love and acceptance can be reconciled with its practice of excluding those who do not conform to its norms. While the Catholic Church teaches that love and acceptance are fundamental principles, its actions often suggest a more limited and exclusive approach. This tension between theory and practice can be a source of frustration and disillusionment, particularly for those who seek a more inclusive and compassionate faith.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I share the view that it would not necessarily address the root causes of pedophilia within the Church. As I see it, the decision to engage in such behavior is a choice that is not directly related to marital status. In fact, my understanding is that individuals who are capable of such actions are likely to continue doing so regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition is an essential aspect of the Catholic Church, it must be balanced with a willingness to adapt and evolve. The Church's rigid stance on certain issues can sometimes hinder its ability to live up to its core values of love and acceptance. As the Church continues to navigate the complexities of modern society, it is essential that it find a way to reconcile its tradition with its practice, creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all its members.",
            "In this contentious issue, I find myself grappling with a certain degree of ambivalence. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I hesitate to take a definitive stance, as it's a complex problem that has sparked intense debate and emotional attachment. The delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage is indeed a challenging one to navigate without inadvertently offending certain groups.\n\nOne potential solution could be to reevaluate the way we approach marriage, considering it as a civil union rather than a sacrament. This perspective acknowledges the government's role in recognizing and providing benefits to couples, without imposing its own values or interpretations. By doing so, we can avoid blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the distinction between marriage and civil unions becomes more nuanced. It's possible that the government's recognition of marriage as a civil union could be more inclusive, rather than a label imposed by a specific institution. This thought process also raises questions about the role of the government in defining what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage.\n\nIn the context of same-sex marriage, I believe that a civil union approach could provide a more neutral and inclusive framework. It allows the government to acknowledge the union of two consenting adults without imposing its own moral or religious values. Ultimately, the decision to redefine marriage is a matter of personal conviction, but it's essential to approach it with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it's reasonable to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage seems premature and unnecessary. The Constitution should be amended to address matters of significant national import, rather than issues that, while contentious, don't warrant such drastic action.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and civil unions requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. By reexamining our assumptions and considering the role of the government in defining marriage, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding that respects the diversity of individual perspectives.",
            "As someone with a Christian upbringing, I've always navigated the topic of homosexuality with a nuanced perspective. Having many close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to form a deeper understanding of their experiences and the complexities surrounding the issue. While I don't feel entirely in alignment with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle myself, I firmly believe in the importance of equality and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the individual states, rather than be dictated by federal law. This approach acknowledges the diversity of opinions and values across different regions, allowing each state to make decisions that reflect the unique needs and concerns of its citizens. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals are free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nI'm aware that some states lean Democratic and others Republican, and it's not surprising that Democratic states tend to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. However, I believe that individuals who choose to reside in a particular state have a responsibility to respect the values and laws that govern their community. By leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the states, we're allowing local leaders to make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being and happiness of their constituents.\n\nIn the case of former President Bush's stance on gay marriage, I disagree with his efforts to impose a national ban. As the President of the United States, he had a unique platform to shape the country's policies, but I don't believe that his opinions should supersede the autonomy of individual states. In fact, his impending departure from office highlights the impermanence of federal decisions and the importance of allowing states to chart their own course.\n\nUltimately, I believe that certain issues, like same-sex marriage, should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach recognizes the complexity of the issue and the varying values of different communities. By empowering states to make their own decisions, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination.",
            "The concept of Myspace as a public platform is often misunderstood. Upon reflection, it's clear that anything posted online can be accessed by anyone. This includes school officials, who may be checking for potential security threats, such as students engaging in substance use or other prohibited behaviors.\n\nWhile one may feel uncomfortable with the idea of school officials monitoring online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students. In this context, online monitoring can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent incidents like school shootings.\n\nThe idea that school officials might access Myspace profiles outside of their official capacity is also relevant. Even if a student doesn't explicitly state they're associated with the school, their profile can still be discovered through various means, including their home internet connections. \n\nSchool officials may use social media to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. This proactive approach can help prevent problems and make the school a safer place. In fact, many schools have implemented various safety protocols, such as lockdown drills, to prepare for potential threats.\n\nIn the case of the Myspace monitoring, the school officials' actions can be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure student safety. While it may seem invasive, their primary goal is to prevent harm and create a secure environment for all students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a way of holding onto information, making it difficult to erase past online activity. This highlights the importance of being mindful of one's online presence and the potential consequences of posting sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, while school officials may seem overzealous in their monitoring, their actions are ultimately aimed at creating a safer environment for students. This may involve accessing social media platforms like Myspace to identify potential issues and prevent harm.",
            "The invasion of Iraq was a decision that I initially supported, largely driven by the personal impact of 9/11 on my life. However, as I reflected further on the situation, I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional response to the attacks led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the potential outcomes of our involvement.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that we entered the conflict without a clear plan for the post-invasion period, which led to unforeseen challenges and setbacks. I think that our initial motivations were driven more by a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The President's decision to declare war on Iraq, while understandable in the context of the time, was also driven by public opinion and a desire for action.\n\nLooking back, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of imposing our will on a country with such a different cultural and historical context. The concept of war is perceived very differently in Iraq than it is in the US, and our actions were often viewed as an invasion rather than a liberation.\n\nI now believe that our presence in Iraq has not brought about the desired outcome and may have even exacerbated the situation. The ongoing conflict has highlighted the challenges of nation-building and the difficulty of imposing democratic values on a country with a different cultural identity. I think that we should have been more cautious in our approach and considered the long-term implications of our actions.\n\nWhile we have made some progress in Iraq, I believe that our continued presence is not sufficient to achieve lasting stability. I think that our involvement has actually hindered our own interests and that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region. Ultimately, I believe that the people of Iraq must take ownership of their country's future, and we should focus on supporting their efforts rather than trying to impose our will on them.\n\nI also believe that our initial motivations and actions were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a genuine desire to help the Iraqi people. Our actions were seen as an attempt to impose our values and way of life on a country that was not ready or willing to accept them. I think that this approach was misguided and has ultimately led to more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I initially supported the invasion of Iraq, I now believe that it was a mistake. Our actions were driven by emotion rather than careful planning and consideration, and our continued presence has not brought about the desired outcome. I think that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region and focus on supporting the people of Iraq rather than trying to impose our will on them."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church's views on certain issues may be contributing to its declining membership. While it's natural for institutions to hold strong convictions, their stance on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control may be perceived as outdated by some. This perceived rigidity can lead individuals to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable within the Church.\n\nFor instance, when a person holds a different viewpoint on abortion or gay marriage, they may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and potentially even alienate individuals from the faith. Essentially, the Church's stance on these issues may be driving people away.\n\nOne potential area for reform is in the Church's stance on female priests and married clergy. Some may argue that these changes could help the Church become more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience. However, it's challenging to predict the outcome, as human behavior is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Church's teachings on devotion and commitment are rooted in the idea that priests are married to God. This notion suggests that priests are expected to prioritize their spiritual duties above all else. Nevertheless, the idea that clergy cannot have a family life or personal relationships is not unique to the Church. Many individuals in various professions lead double lives, balancing their professional and personal responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's stance on certain issues and its stance on female priests and married clergy may be contributing to its declining membership. While some may view these stances as outdated, others may see them as essential to the Church's identity. Ultimately, the relationship between the Church and its members is complex and influenced by various factors.",
            "In my opinion, the idea that people's sexual orientation is solely a matter of personal choice is not a stance I subscribe to. I believe that individuals are born with their inherent nature, and it's not something that can be altered through conscious decision-making. This perspective leads me to think that it's unfair to hold people responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize that people's identities are not something they can change at will. For instance, while some individuals are born with a heterosexual inclination, others are born with a same-sex attraction. It's crucial to acknowledge that these are natural variations and not something that can be willfully chosen.\n\nWhen it comes to marriage, I believe that the federal government should not have a say in who individuals can marry. The issue is not a matter of national security or morality; it's a personal matter between two consenting adults. It's not the government's place to dictate who can form a union and who cannot.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people's sexual orientation is not a decision they made, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's essential to respect individuals for who they are and allow them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution.\n\nUltimately, I think it's crucial to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The government should not have the authority to interfere with personal relationships or dictate who can love whom.",
            "The notion of gay marriage legalization has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I firmly believe that this perspective is misguided. Essentially, the two are fundamentally different yet intertwined concepts that cannot be compared directly. The issue is often oversimplified, neglecting the multifaceted aspects that make relationships unique.\n\nOne oft-cited concern is the perceived impact on heterosexual families. However, this argument is based on an oversimplified understanding of the complexities involved. Studies have consistently shown that homosexual couples exhibit similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the fact that homosexual couples are not seeking to obtain a church-sanctioned marriage, but rather a legally recognized union provided by the government. If we separate church and state, the question of moral opposition becomes irrelevant. The provision of a marriage certificate should not be contingent upon the approval of a particular religious group.\n\nIn fact, the lack of equal rights for homosexual couples can be likened to a form of segregation. The notion that they are denied a fundamental right while others enjoy it is a clear infringement on their civil liberties.\n\nConcerns surrounding adoption, community integration, and the impact on children of gay couples are often cited as reasons to oppose gay marriage. However, these concerns are often based on unsubstantiated fears and biases. In reality, children raised by gay parents are not inherently disadvantaged, and their well-being is not predetermined by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nThe phenomenon of bullying and societal pressure faced by children of gay parents is a pressing issue that demands attention and action. Rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes, we should focus on creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.\n\nRegarding the role of government in this issue, I firmly believe that the federal government should play a more proactive role in ensuring the equality of all citizens. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only misguided but also hypocritical, given the government's stance on other issues such as the separation of church and state.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that gay couples are somehow flawed or damaged is a baseless stereotype that has been thoroughly debunked by reputable institutions. By ignoring the scientific consensus and instead relying on anecdotal evidence and personal biases, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and fear. It is time for us to reevaluate our stance on this issue and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One aspect of my summer experience at the hospital pharmacy has led me to consider the multifaceted nature of controlled substances. While certain medications may be prohibited, they continue to demonstrate significant therapeutic potential. In the context of public accessibility, I believe that such substances should not be made readily available. However, their use in medical settings is a different matter. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily negate its benefits.\n\nAs a pharmacy professional, I've seen firsthand the controlled use of substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse. Despite their illicit status, these medications are instrumental in alleviating pain and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, the medicinal properties of marijuana should be acknowledged and respected, rather than being dismissed due to societal stigma.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is not entirely apt, as marijuana's risks are distinct from those associated with excessive drinking. While both substances can be misused, their impacts differ significantly. A more nuanced approach to marijuana regulation would involve a gradual integration into mainstream society, accompanied by education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana is deeply ingrained, largely due to its classification as an illicit substance. However, this image is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of marijuana's risks and benefits. In fact, it's not as hazardous as other Schedule I substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the societal stigma surrounding marijuana, we can begin to view it as a legitimate treatment option, rather than a taboo.\n\nUltimately, a more informed and balanced perspective on marijuana is necessary, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and risks. By doing so, we can work towards a more responsible and evidence-based approach to its use and regulation.",
            "The Catholic Church has undergone significant transformations in recent years to adapt to the changing times. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms. As someone who has been involved with the church their whole life, I've witnessed firsthand the shift towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere. Even within my own experiences, I've noticed a change in the way people dress and engage with the church community.\n\nGrowing up, attending church on Sundays was a regular occurrence, and I would often get dressed up in my finest attire. However, that's no longer the case. The introduction of a shorter Teen Mass has made Sundays more accessible and relaxed, with attendees often wearing casual clothing, even jeans and khakis. This change is particularly noticeable during the warmer months when beachwear is a common sight.\n\nWhile I'm not well-versed in the church's internal politics, one thing is clear: the focus has shifted towards a more casual and welcoming environment. As for the accusations of pedophilia, I believe that these issues are complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I'm not convinced that this would have been the case. Research suggests that pedophilia is a deeply ingrained trait, often rooted in genetics. It's not something that can be easily addressed through changes in the church's policies or practices.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that individuals who are predisposed to pedophilia are unlikely to change their behavior, regardless of their marital status or religious affiliation. While it's essential to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing, I don't believe that the church's policies are to blame for these heinous crimes. Rather, it's the actions of individuals that have caused harm, and it's crucial to address these issues through education, support, and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's evolution towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere is a positive development, but it's essential to separate this from the complex issues surrounding pedophilia. By acknowledging the root causes of these problems and addressing them through a comprehensive approach, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive community for all.",
            "Upon reflection, I have come to realize that the premise we were initially considering had significant implications stemming from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration leveraged a complex series of events and pretexts to justify the invasion of Iraq, which ultimately led to the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, it has since been established that these claims were unfounded.\n\nI strongly believe that the Bush administration's actions and subsequent lack of accountability for these misrepresentations have been particularly egregious. Notably, Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, has since acknowledged his own doubts about the evidence presented at the time of the UN presentation. This demonstrates a disturbing disregard for truth and accountability, which I argue constitutes a serious breach of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions suggest a concerning disregard for the US Constitution and the principles it upholds. Since September 11th, I have witnessed a persistent attempt to marginalize key provisions of the Constitution, which has only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt is my understanding that the younger Bush had a pre-existing agenda to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy, which was motivated in part by his father's past experiences. This agenda may have been driven by a desire to secure access to new energy resources, a goal that is both ambitious and potentially problematic.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the complexities of the situation, I believe that the conflict has endured for far too long. A hasty withdrawal could lead to destabilization and increased bloodshed, potentially plunging the country into civil war. Alternatively, the proposed coalition of regional nations, which includes Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be a viable solution, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create long-term instability.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that the interim government is failing to assert its authority, with the Parliament struggling to establish a cohesive leadership and the Prime Minister lacking control. The influence of radical elements, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, is also contributing to the fractious nature of the political process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I struggle to articulate a clear solution, I firmly believe that the Bush administration's actions have been deeply problematic and that the situation in Iraq remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",
            "Upon reflection, I have mixed feelings regarding the War in Iraq. Initially, I was unsure of where to begin, but it became apparent that a declared war by Congress is a crucial factor in my opinion. Without such a declaration, the conflict seems more like a retaliatory measure in response to the 9/11 attacks. While I don't feel well-versed in the intricacies of the conflict, I understand that our presence in Iraq is aimed at establishing a democratic government and securing resources.\n\nHowever, this approach raises concerns about the feasibility and morality of our involvement. The prolonged duration of the war has led to widespread resentment and instability in the region. Moreover, the difficulty in establishing democracy in a foreign context is a daunting task, and our continued presence may only exacerbate the situation.\n\nOne argument in favor of continuing the war is the concern for the families of service members stationed in Iraq. It is essential to consider the human cost and the impact on the local population. Nevertheless, this perspective is overshadowed by the risk of cultural insensitivity and the potential for our actions to be perceived as an attempt to impose our values on another nation.\n\nA more nuanced approach might be to reevaluate our role in the conflict and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. The ongoing occupation has already led to the growth of extremist groups and increased hostility towards the United States. In light of this, it seems that our continued presence may ultimately be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, the War in Iraq is a complex issue, and my opinion is that it would be beneficial to reassess our involvement and consider a more measured approach. This would allow us to address the root causes of the conflict while minimizing the harm caused to the local population and our own nation.",
            "There are legitimate concerns regarding the government's involvement in declaring something as legal or illegal, particularly when it comes to matters of religious freedom. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it's essential to uphold this principle.\n\nWhen considering the potential for an amendment that restricts certain religious practices, it's crucial to examine the motivations behind this initiative. One must question whether the government is attempting to impose its will on a particular group, rather than allowing for religious tolerance and diversity.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the Constitution since its inception, fostering a culture of religious freedom in the United States. Proposing an amendment that would restrict this freedom would be counterintuitive and contradictory to the founding principles of the nation. Furthermore, such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, which raises significant concerns.\n\nThe government should refrain from intervening in matters of religious practice, as this would be an overreach of authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of religious groups. The president's personal beliefs, as a Catholic, do not provide a sufficient justification for proposing an amendment that discriminates against other faiths. Any decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities directly affected, rather than being imposed by the government.\n\nWhile some may argue that an amendment is necessary to address a perceived issue, a closer examination reveals that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that this amendment would have a positive impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that such an amendment could have unintended consequences, including stifling religious diversity and freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should not be involved in declaring certain religious practices as illegal, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the principles of separation of church and state. The decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities, rather than being imposed by the government.",
            "The Iraq War remains a highly debated topic, with many questioning the motives behind the United States' decision to invade the country in 2003. I firmly believe that the government's initial justifications for the war were not entirely transparent, and that the connection between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that the government played on the emotions of the American people, capitalizing on their outrage following the terrorist attacks of 2001. This led to a lack of critical evaluation of the potential consequences of invading Iraq. As someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was skeptical of the decision from the outset.\n\nThe parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking. Both conflicts involve attempts to impose democracy on foreign nations, often with disastrous results. The removal of the Iraqi government and the subsequent power vacuum led to chaos and instability, which the US was not adequately prepared to handle. This echoes the lessons of Vietnam, where the US struggled to establish a stable government and ultimately withdrew.\n\nThe war has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, with many soldiers continuing to die in a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The US government underestimated the complexity of rebuilding a nation and establishing a functioning democracy. This is a process that requires time, effort, and resources, as exemplified by the struggles our own country faced in its transition to democracy.\n\nMoreover, the US government's decision to invade Iraq raises questions about its motivations. While the stated goal was to promote democracy, many believe that the primary driver was access to Iraq's oil reserves. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, coupled with the fact that the US has not taken similar action against other nations with similar capabilities, such as North Korea, further fuels these suspicions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to go to war in Iraq was likely based on a mix of factors, including a desire to expand US influence and secure access to valuable resources. As the conflict continues to drag on, it is essential to re-evaluate the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was torn between supporting the incumbent, George Bush, and opposing the war. While I initially believed that allowing him to complete his term was the right decision, the ongoing conflict and the continued loss of American lives have made me question this stance. The war has become a protracted and complex issue, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to invest significant resources in the conflict, it is essential to consider the human cost and the potential long-term benefits of a US withdrawal.",
            "I would like to express my support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. My stance on this issue has been consistent throughout my life, and I firmly believe that marriage is a personal preference that should not be dictated by societal norms or external factors.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the possibility that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological factors, rather than solely by societal conditioning. This realization has led me to reconsider the notion that individuals should be denied rights based on their sexual orientation, which is often beyond their control.\n\nI believe that it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marry based on their sexual orientation, and I have always been an advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the role of government and politics should be limited to protecting individual rights, rather than imposing moral or societal values.\n\nIn my community, I have observed that same-sex couples function just like any other family unit, participating in everyday activities and contributing to their communities. It is disconcerting to see politicians attempting to redefine the concept of marriage to suit their own values, rather than respecting the diversity of human relationships.\n\nResearch suggests that sexual orientation may be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than purely by societal upbringing. This understanding has led me to question the notion that same-sex attraction is a choice, and to recognize the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage is a personal matter that should be between the individuals involved, rather than a public or political issue. Just as individuals are free to get married without public fanfare, same-sex couples should have the same right to enter into a committed partnership without fear of public scrutiny or judgment.",
            "There are certain expectations that come with posting content online. Once something is published on the internet, it becomes a public forum that anyone can access. As someone who has experience with this in a residential setting, I can attest to the fact that online activities can significantly impact how people perceive individuals.\n\nWhen discussing sensitive topics such as violence or threats, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of sharing them online. What may seem like a joke or a harmless comment to the poster can be misconstrued by others, potentially leading to serious repercussions.\n\nIn a school setting, if a student posts something alarming, it's not uncommon for school officials to investigate the situation further. This is often done to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff. While it's essential to respect students' online privacy, there are instances where school administrators may need to intervene.\n\nFor example, if a student posts something that raises concerns about their mental health or intentions, it's the school's responsibility to address the situation. This can be done without infringing on the student's privacy, as the information was shared publicly. However, it's also crucial to note that not all online activity warrants intervention.\n\nSchool officials should not engage in excessive monitoring of students' online activities, such as friending them on social media or tracking their phone conversations. If concerns are brought to their attention, it's essential to handle them in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nA similar principle applies to residential advisors like myself. While it's not necessary to be friends with residents on social media, we must be prepared to address any issues that arise from their online activity. This can be a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that once something is posted online, it's accessible to a wide audience. If you don't want certain information to be shared or don't want people to form a particular opinion about you, it's best to exercise caution when posting online.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its original purpose. Initially, the intention was to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, a goal that I believe is noble. However, over time, I fear that the primary motivation has shifted from a desire to promote democracy to a demonstration of military prowess.\n\nLooking back, I think the initial invasion was a powerful statement in itself, sending a clear message about our commitment to democracy. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict has raised concerns about the true reasons behind our involvement. If the primary objective was to establish democracy, it's likely that our efforts would have been more focused and decisive. Instead, it appears that we have become bogged down in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.\n\nIn my opinion, our original motivation was admirable, but it has been compromised by personal and ulterior motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. This has led to a war that has become increasingly complex and difficult to justify.\n\nI believe that we have already achieved a significant portion of our goals in the initial stages of the conflict. It's time to reassess our priorities and acknowledge that our continued involvement is no longer justifiable. The war has drained our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. As a result, I strongly believe that it's time to bring our troops home and allow the country to take ownership of its future.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that war should not be a long-term expenditure in our budget. We have pressing domestic concerns that require attention and funding, such as maintaining public roads, improving education, and providing quality healthcare. The financial burdens of this war have come at a high cost, including the loss of American lives and the erosion of our national funds. It's time for a change in direction and a renewed focus on our own nation's needs.",
            "The question of balancing online privacy with potential consequences is a complex one. If an individual shares personal information on a social networking site, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, users must accept friend requests from others to view their profiles, thereby granting permission to access their content. This understanding is crucial when contributing to online communities.\n\nHowever, the idea of monitoring students' online profiles to prevent potential harm raises concerns. While it may be possible for someone to stumble upon potentially problematic information, it's impractical and potentially discriminatory to have someone dedicated to scrutinizing individual profiles. The decision to monitor should be based on specific circumstances, such as evidence of suspicious behavior, rather than a general policy.\n\nMy personal experience with social media has taught me to be cautious about sharing personal information. Although I don't maintain a Myspace profile, I do have a Facebook account, and I'm aware of the risks associated with online interactions. A documentary I watched highlighted the ease with which an individual can gather information from social media profiles, which can be used to manipulate others. This has led me to limit the information I share online, while still allowing me to maintain connections with friends.\n\nHowever, I've also come to realize that it's difficult to control who has access to our online presence. Even with privacy settings in place, there's still a risk that others can view our information. This is why I'm careful about accepting friend requests and limit the amount of personal data I share.\n\nA recent conversation with my roommate about her high school experience shed light on the issue of school administrators banning students from using Myspace. While I'm not entirely sure about the reasoning behind this decision, it did raise questions about the extent of authority schools have over students' online activities.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between online privacy and potential consequences is a delicate one. While it's essential to be mindful of the information we share online, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of blanket policies aimed at monitoring students' online activities.",
            "The Iraq War has been a highly debated topic, with various perspectives emerging over time. Initially, many people, including myself, expressed opposition to the invasion. However, as the situation has evolved, the general consensus worldwide has shifted towards viewing the war as a regrettable decision. This is evident in the overwhelming majority of global polls, which suggest that approximately 75-80% of the international community, including a significant percentage of Iraqi citizens and US troops stationed in Iraq, consider the war to have been a mistake.\n\nThe complexities of the Middle East and the cultural differences between Western and Middle Eastern societies can make it challenging to implement successful democratic reforms. The notion that a foreign power can impose its values and governance structures on a region with a distinct history and cultural identity is a notion that has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly problematic, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking military action, particularly when the outcome is uncertain. The rapid escalation of the situation has led to a prolonged and arduous conflict, with numerous challenges and obstacles hindering a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering the prevailing sentiment among the Iraqi population and the international community, it is worth considering the possibility of a gradual withdrawal of US forces over the course of a year or more. This approach would allow for a more measured exit strategy while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences. Notably, a significant portion of Iraqis advocate for an immediate withdrawal, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the current presence.\n\nThe notion that the Iraqi people's decisions should be taken into account is a valid one. If they are telling us to leave, it is essential to consider their perspective and assess the situation objectively. Ultimately, if we were to withdraw and the situation were to deteriorate, we could argue that we had given the Iraqi people the opportunity to make their own decisions and that any negative outcomes would be a result of their choices, not ours.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War has been a multifaceted and intricate issue, with various stakeholders holding different views on its legitimacy and effectiveness. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it seems that a gradual withdrawal of US forces, potentially followed by international assistance, could be a more viable and responsible approach.",
            "One of the most pressing issues in the United States today is the persistence of gender discrimination. While progress has been made in recent years, it remains a significant hurdle in various industries. I firmly believe that societal attitudes and expectations play a substantial role in perpetuating this issue. For instance, in the corporate world, women often face barriers to advancement due to the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where despite having the necessary qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions in favor of male candidates.\n\nThis is not to say that men are immune to discrimination; on the contrary, they too can face difficulties in fields such as fashion, where traditional stereotypes can make it challenging for men to be taken seriously. The notion that men who are interested in fashion are somehow less masculine or less capable can be a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations around caregiving roles can also perpetuate gender discrimination. The stigma surrounding men who stay at home to care for their children is still prevalent, with many people viewing it as unconventional or even unnatural. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for stay-at-home dads, who are often judged for prioritizing family responsibilities over professional ambitions.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where traditional gender roles can be limiting. Men who work in fashion may be subject to skepticism simply because of their gender, with some people questioning their understanding of the industry.\n\nHowever, there are signs that attitudes are slowly shifting. As more women take on leadership roles and break down barriers in the corporate world, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, it is becoming clearer that traditional gender roles are no longer the only standard. By promoting the qualities and achievements of individuals who deviate from these norms, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that discrimination can take many forms, and individuals from different backgrounds may face unique challenges. For example, someone from a rural area may face bias due to their accent or lack of formal education, despite being intelligent and capable. Similarly, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may face prejudice based on their language or customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in addressing gender discrimination in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and working towards greater understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.",
            "My understanding is that while marijuana has not been fully legalized, it has undergone decriminalization, which has downgraded it from a criminal offense to a more akin to a traffic citation. This change involves a less severe outcome, such as receiving a fine rather than facing arrest, booking, and prosecution. Consequently, individuals cited for marijuana possession or use may face fewer consequences in the long run, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications, which can be detrimental to one's future.\n\nHowever, there are varying perspectives on the matter. On one hand, decriminalization can be economically advantageous for municipalities, as it reduces the costs associated with law enforcement, court proceedings, and public defense. This can be a significant concern for financially strained cities, making it a difficult decision to make. In contrast, some communities may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to philosophical or cultural opposition to marijuana.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, has taken a different approach, and it appears to have benefited from the change. As a result, they have redirected funds toward public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. This shift is a significant step forward, especially considering the economic constraints that many municipalities face.\n\nIt is essential to consider the potential consequences of full legalization, as it could lead to increased availability and visibility of marijuana. This might result in a rise in smoking-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. Moreover, societal norms and stigma surrounding marijuana use still exist, making it a sensitive topic in many contexts.\n\nInterestingly, while marijuana's effects on motor skills are not as pronounced as those of alcohol, its impact on lifestyle can be more profound for some individuals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that people react differently to substances, and personal characteristics, such as moderation and self-control, play a significant role in determining the outcome. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, making it challenging to generalize their impact on individuals.",
            "I believe that the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the institution has a rich history and a set of guiding principles that have been upheld for centuries. However, this steadfast commitment to tradition can sometimes make it difficult for the Church to adapt to changing times and circumstances.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this dilemma is the Church's stance on interfaith marriage. My own family's experience with this issue serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of a rigid adherence to doctrine. My parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in the Catholic Church because of the Church's refusal to accept my father's Episcopalian faith.\n\nThis experience has led me to wonder whether the Church's doctrine of love and acceptance can be reconciled with its practice of excluding those who do not conform to its norms. While the Catholic Church teaches that love and acceptance are fundamental principles, its actions often suggest a more limited and exclusive approach. This tension between theory and practice can be a source of frustration and disillusionment, particularly for those who seek a more inclusive and compassionate faith.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I share the view that it would not necessarily address the root causes of pedophilia within the Church. As I see it, the decision to engage in such behavior is a choice that is not directly related to marital status. In fact, my understanding is that individuals who are capable of such actions are likely to continue doing so regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition is an essential aspect of the Catholic Church, it must be balanced with a willingness to adapt and evolve. The Church's rigid stance on certain issues can sometimes hinder its ability to live up to its core values of love and acceptance. As the Church continues to navigate the complexities of modern society, it is essential that it find a way to reconcile its tradition with its practice, creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all its members.",
            "In this contentious issue, I find myself grappling with a certain degree of ambivalence. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I hesitate to take a definitive stance, as it's a complex problem that has sparked intense debate and emotional attachment. The delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage is indeed a challenging one to navigate without inadvertently offending certain groups.\n\nOne potential solution could be to reevaluate the way we approach marriage, considering it as a civil union rather than a sacrament. This perspective acknowledges the government's role in recognizing and providing benefits to couples, without imposing its own values or interpretations. By doing so, we can avoid blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the distinction between marriage and civil unions becomes more nuanced. It's possible that the government's recognition of marriage as a civil union could be more inclusive, rather than a label imposed by a specific institution. This thought process also raises questions about the role of the government in defining what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage.\n\nIn the context of same-sex marriage, I believe that a civil union approach could provide a more neutral and inclusive framework. It allows the government to acknowledge the union of two consenting adults without imposing its own moral or religious values. Ultimately, the decision to redefine marriage is a matter of personal conviction, but it's essential to approach it with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it's reasonable to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage seems premature and unnecessary. The Constitution should be amended to address matters of significant national import, rather than issues that, while contentious, don't warrant such drastic action.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and civil unions requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. By reexamining our assumptions and considering the role of the government in defining marriage, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding that respects the diversity of individual perspectives.",
            "As someone with a Christian upbringing, I've always navigated the topic of homosexuality with a nuanced perspective. Having many close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to form a deeper understanding of their experiences and the complexities surrounding the issue. While I don't feel entirely in alignment with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle myself, I firmly believe in the importance of equality and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the individual states, rather than be dictated by federal law. This approach acknowledges the diversity of opinions and values across different regions, allowing each state to make decisions that reflect the unique needs and concerns of its citizens. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals are free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nI'm aware that some states lean Democratic and others Republican, and it's not surprising that Democratic states tend to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. However, I believe that individuals who choose to reside in a particular state have a responsibility to respect the values and laws that govern their community. By leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the states, we're allowing local leaders to make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being and happiness of their constituents.\n\nIn the case of former President Bush's stance on gay marriage, I disagree with his efforts to impose a national ban. As the President of the United States, he had a unique platform to shape the country's policies, but I don't believe that his opinions should supersede the autonomy of individual states. In fact, his impending departure from office highlights the impermanence of federal decisions and the importance of allowing states to chart their own course.\n\nUltimately, I believe that certain issues, like same-sex marriage, should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach recognizes the complexity of the issue and the varying values of different communities. By empowering states to make their own decisions, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination.",
            "The concept of Myspace as a public platform is often misunderstood. Upon reflection, it's clear that anything posted online can be accessed by anyone. This includes school officials, who may be checking for potential security threats, such as students engaging in substance use or other prohibited behaviors.\n\nWhile one may feel uncomfortable with the idea of school officials monitoring online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students. In this context, online monitoring can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent incidents like school shootings.\n\nThe idea that school officials might access Myspace profiles outside of their official capacity is also relevant. Even if a student doesn't explicitly state they're associated with the school, their profile can still be discovered through various means, including their home internet connections. \n\nSchool officials may use social media to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. This proactive approach can help prevent problems and make the school a safer place. In fact, many schools have implemented various safety protocols, such as lockdown drills, to prepare for potential threats.\n\nIn the case of the Myspace monitoring, the school officials' actions can be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure student safety. While it may seem invasive, their primary goal is to prevent harm and create a secure environment for all students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a way of holding onto information, making it difficult to erase past online activity. This highlights the importance of being mindful of one's online presence and the potential consequences of posting sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, while school officials may seem overzealous in their monitoring, their actions are ultimately aimed at creating a safer environment for students. This may involve accessing social media platforms like Myspace to identify potential issues and prevent harm.",
            "The invasion of Iraq was a decision that I initially supported, largely driven by the personal impact of 9/11 on my life. However, as I reflected further on the situation, I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional response to the attacks led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the potential outcomes of our involvement.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that we entered the conflict without a clear plan for the post-invasion period, which led to unforeseen challenges and setbacks. I think that our initial motivations were driven more by a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The President's decision to declare war on Iraq, while understandable in the context of the time, was also driven by public opinion and a desire for action.\n\nLooking back, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of imposing our will on a country with such a different cultural and historical context. The concept of war is perceived very differently in Iraq than it is in the US, and our actions were often viewed as an invasion rather than a liberation.\n\nI now believe that our presence in Iraq has not brought about the desired outcome and may have even exacerbated the situation. The ongoing conflict has highlighted the challenges of nation-building and the difficulty of imposing democratic values on a country with a different cultural identity. I think that we should have been more cautious in our approach and considered the long-term implications of our actions.\n\nWhile we have made some progress in Iraq, I believe that our continued presence is not sufficient to achieve lasting stability. I think that our involvement has actually hindered our own interests and that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region. Ultimately, I believe that the people of Iraq must take ownership of their country's future, and we should focus on supporting their efforts rather than trying to impose our will on them.\n\nI also believe that our initial motivations and actions were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a genuine desire to help the Iraqi people. Our actions were seen as an attempt to impose our values and way of life on a country that was not ready or willing to accept them. I think that this approach was misguided and has ultimately led to more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I initially supported the invasion of Iraq, I now believe that it was a mistake. Our actions were driven by emotion rather than careful planning and consideration, and our continued presence has not brought about the desired outcome. I think that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region and focus on supporting the people of Iraq rather than trying to impose our will on them."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church's views on certain issues may be contributing to its declining membership. While it's natural for institutions to hold strong convictions, their stance on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control may be perceived as outdated by some. This perceived rigidity can lead individuals to feel unwelcome or uncomfortable within the Church.\n\nFor instance, when a person holds a different viewpoint on abortion or gay marriage, they may struggle to reconcile their personal beliefs with the Church's teachings. This can lead to a sense of disconnection and potentially even alienate individuals from the faith. Essentially, the Church's stance on these issues may be driving people away.\n\nOne potential area for reform is in the Church's stance on female priests and married clergy. Some may argue that these changes could help the Church become more inclusive and appealing to a broader audience. However, it's challenging to predict the outcome, as human behavior is complex and influenced by various factors.\n\nIt's worth noting that the Church's teachings on devotion and commitment are rooted in the idea that priests are married to God. This notion suggests that priests are expected to prioritize their spiritual duties above all else. Nevertheless, the idea that clergy cannot have a family life or personal relationships is not unique to the Church. Many individuals in various professions lead double lives, balancing their professional and personal responsibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's stance on certain issues and its stance on female priests and married clergy may be contributing to its declining membership. While some may view these stances as outdated, others may see them as essential to the Church's identity. Ultimately, the relationship between the Church and its members is complex and influenced by various factors.",
            "In my opinion, the idea that people's sexual orientation is solely a matter of personal choice is not a stance I subscribe to. I believe that individuals are born with their inherent nature, and it's not something that can be altered through conscious decision-making. This perspective leads me to think that it's unfair to hold people responsible for their sexual orientation.\n\nI think it's essential to recognize that people's identities are not something they can change at will. For instance, while some individuals are born with a heterosexual inclination, others are born with a same-sex attraction. It's crucial to acknowledge that these are natural variations and not something that can be willfully chosen.\n\nWhen it comes to marriage, I believe that the federal government should not have a say in who individuals can marry. The issue is not a matter of national security or morality; it's a personal matter between two consenting adults. It's not the government's place to dictate who can form a union and who cannot.\n\nIt's also worth noting that people's sexual orientation is not a decision they made, and they shouldn't be punished for it. It's essential to respect individuals for who they are and allow them the freedom to live their lives without fear of judgment or persecution.\n\nUltimately, I think it's crucial to recognize the inherent worth and dignity of all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation. The government should not have the authority to interfere with personal relationships or dictate who can love whom.",
            "The notion of gay marriage legalization has sparked intense debate in recent years. While some argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional family structures, I firmly believe that this perspective is misguided. Essentially, the two are fundamentally different yet intertwined concepts that cannot be compared directly. The issue is often oversimplified, neglecting the multifaceted aspects that make relationships unique.\n\nOne oft-cited concern is the perceived impact on heterosexual families. However, this argument is based on an oversimplified understanding of the complexities involved. Studies have consistently shown that homosexual couples exhibit similar rates of success and relationship satisfaction as their heterosexual counterparts.\n\nThe crux of the issue lies in the fact that homosexual couples are not seeking to obtain a church-sanctioned marriage, but rather a legally recognized union provided by the government. If we separate church and state, the question of moral opposition becomes irrelevant. The provision of a marriage certificate should not be contingent upon the approval of a particular religious group.\n\nIn fact, the lack of equal rights for homosexual couples can be likened to a form of segregation. The notion that they are denied a fundamental right while others enjoy it is a clear infringement on their civil liberties.\n\nConcerns surrounding adoption, community integration, and the impact on children of gay couples are often cited as reasons to oppose gay marriage. However, these concerns are often based on unsubstantiated fears and biases. In reality, children raised by gay parents are not inherently disadvantaged, and their well-being is not predetermined by their parents' sexual orientation.\n\nThe phenomenon of bullying and societal pressure faced by children of gay parents is a pressing issue that demands attention and action. Rather than perpetuating negative stereotypes, we should focus on creating an inclusive environment that values diversity and promotes understanding.\n\nRegarding the role of government in this issue, I firmly believe that the federal government should play a more proactive role in ensuring the equality of all citizens. The proposed amendment to ban gay marriage is not only misguided but also hypocritical, given the government's stance on other issues such as the separation of church and state.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that gay couples are somehow flawed or damaged is a baseless stereotype that has been thoroughly debunked by reputable institutions. By ignoring the scientific consensus and instead relying on anecdotal evidence and personal biases, we risk perpetuating a culture of intolerance and fear. It is time for us to reevaluate our stance on this issue and work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.",
            "One aspect of my summer experience at the hospital pharmacy has led me to consider the multifaceted nature of controlled substances. While certain medications may be prohibited, they continue to demonstrate significant therapeutic potential. In the context of public accessibility, I believe that such substances should not be made readily available. However, their use in medical settings is a different matter. It's essential to recognize that the illegality of a substance does not necessarily negate its benefits.\n\nAs a pharmacy professional, I've seen firsthand the controlled use of substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are classified as controlled substances due to their potential for abuse. Despite their illicit status, these medications are instrumental in alleviating pain and improving patient outcomes. Similarly, the medicinal properties of marijuana should be acknowledged and respected, rather than being dismissed due to societal stigma.\n\nThe comparison to alcohol is not entirely apt, as marijuana's risks are distinct from those associated with excessive drinking. While both substances can be misused, their impacts differ significantly. A more nuanced approach to marijuana regulation would involve a gradual integration into mainstream society, accompanied by education and awareness campaigns to promote responsible use.\n\nThe negative perception of marijuana is deeply ingrained, largely due to its classification as an illicit substance. However, this image is misleading and does not accurately reflect the reality of marijuana's risks and benefits. In fact, it's not as hazardous as other Schedule I substances like heroin or cocaine. By reevaluating the societal stigma surrounding marijuana, we can begin to view it as a legitimate treatment option, rather than a taboo.\n\nUltimately, a more informed and balanced perspective on marijuana is necessary, one that acknowledges both its potential benefits and risks. By doing so, we can work towards a more responsible and evidence-based approach to its use and regulation.",
            "The Catholic Church has undergone significant transformations in recent years to adapt to the changing times. Gone are the days of strict adherence to traditional norms. As someone who has been involved with the church their whole life, I've witnessed firsthand the shift towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere. Even within my own experiences, I've noticed a change in the way people dress and engage with the church community.\n\nGrowing up, attending church on Sundays was a regular occurrence, and I would often get dressed up in my finest attire. However, that's no longer the case. The introduction of a shorter Teen Mass has made Sundays more accessible and relaxed, with attendees often wearing casual clothing, even jeans and khakis. This change is particularly noticeable during the warmer months when beachwear is a common sight.\n\nWhile I'm not well-versed in the church's internal politics, one thing is clear: the focus has shifted towards a more casual and welcoming environment. As for the accusations of pedophilia, I believe that these issues are complex and multifaceted. While some may argue that allowing female priests or married priests could have mitigated the problem, I'm not convinced that this would have been the case. Research suggests that pedophilia is a deeply ingrained trait, often rooted in genetics. It's not something that can be easily addressed through changes in the church's policies or practices.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that individuals who are predisposed to pedophilia are unlikely to change their behavior, regardless of their marital status or religious affiliation. While it's essential to hold those in power accountable for any wrongdoing, I don't believe that the church's policies are to blame for these heinous crimes. Rather, it's the actions of individuals that have caused harm, and it's crucial to address these issues through education, support, and accountability.\n\nIn conclusion, the Catholic Church's evolution towards a more casual and inclusive atmosphere is a positive development, but it's essential to separate this from the complex issues surrounding pedophilia. By acknowledging the root causes of these problems and addressing them through a comprehensive approach, we can work towards creating a safer and more supportive community for all.",
            "Upon reflection, I have come to realize that the premise we were initially considering had significant implications stemming from the aftermath of the September 11th attacks. It appears that the Bush administration leveraged a complex series of events and pretexts to justify the invasion of Iraq, which ultimately led to the assertion that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction. However, it has since been established that these claims were unfounded.\n\nI strongly believe that the Bush administration's actions and subsequent lack of accountability for these misrepresentations have been particularly egregious. Notably, Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, has since acknowledged his own doubts about the evidence presented at the time of the UN presentation. This demonstrates a disturbing disregard for truth and accountability, which I argue constitutes a serious breach of public trust.\n\nFurthermore, the administration's actions suggest a concerning disregard for the US Constitution and the principles it upholds. Since September 11th, I have witnessed a persistent attempt to marginalize key provisions of the Constitution, which has only served to exacerbate the situation.\n\nIt is my understanding that the younger Bush had a pre-existing agenda to pursue a more aggressive foreign policy, which was motivated in part by his father's past experiences. This agenda may have been driven by a desire to secure access to new energy resources, a goal that is both ambitious and potentially problematic.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the complexities of the situation, I believe that the conflict has endured for far too long. A hasty withdrawal could lead to destabilization and increased bloodshed, potentially plunging the country into civil war. Alternatively, the proposed coalition of regional nations, which includes Syria and Saudi Arabia, may not be a viable solution, as it could undermine Iraq's sovereignty and create long-term instability.\n\nRecent news reports suggest that the interim government is failing to assert its authority, with the Parliament struggling to establish a cohesive leadership and the Prime Minister lacking control. The influence of radical elements, such as Muqtada al-Sadr's party, is also contributing to the fractious nature of the political process.\n\nIn conclusion, while I struggle to articulate a clear solution, I firmly believe that the Bush administration's actions have been deeply problematic and that the situation in Iraq remains fraught with challenges and uncertainties.",
            "Upon reflection, I have mixed feelings regarding the War in Iraq. Initially, I was unsure of where to begin, but it became apparent that a declared war by Congress is a crucial factor in my opinion. Without such a declaration, the conflict seems more like a retaliatory measure in response to the 9/11 attacks. While I don't feel well-versed in the intricacies of the conflict, I understand that our presence in Iraq is aimed at establishing a democratic government and securing resources.\n\nHowever, this approach raises concerns about the feasibility and morality of our involvement. The prolonged duration of the war has led to widespread resentment and instability in the region. Moreover, the difficulty in establishing democracy in a foreign context is a daunting task, and our continued presence may only exacerbate the situation.\n\nOne argument in favor of continuing the war is the concern for the families of service members stationed in Iraq. It is essential to consider the human cost and the impact on the local population. Nevertheless, this perspective is overshadowed by the risk of cultural insensitivity and the potential for our actions to be perceived as an attempt to impose our values on another nation.\n\nA more nuanced approach might be to reevaluate our role in the conflict and consider the long-term consequences of our actions. The ongoing occupation has already led to the growth of extremist groups and increased hostility towards the United States. In light of this, it seems that our continued presence may ultimately be counterproductive.\n\nIn conclusion, the War in Iraq is a complex issue, and my opinion is that it would be beneficial to reassess our involvement and consider a more measured approach. This would allow us to address the root causes of the conflict while minimizing the harm caused to the local population and our own nation.",
            "There are legitimate concerns regarding the government's involvement in declaring something as legal or illegal, particularly when it comes to matters of religious freedom. The Constitution's principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American democracy, and it's essential to uphold this principle.\n\nWhen considering the potential for an amendment that restricts certain religious practices, it's crucial to examine the motivations behind this initiative. One must question whether the government is attempting to impose its will on a particular group, rather than allowing for religious tolerance and diversity.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a fundamental aspect of the Constitution since its inception, fostering a culture of religious freedom in the United States. Proposing an amendment that would restrict this freedom would be counterintuitive and contradictory to the founding principles of the nation. Furthermore, such an amendment would likely serve to restrict the rights of individuals rather than the government, which raises significant concerns.\n\nThe government should refrain from intervening in matters of religious practice, as this would be an overreach of authority and potentially infringe upon the rights of religious groups. The president's personal beliefs, as a Catholic, do not provide a sufficient justification for proposing an amendment that discriminates against other faiths. Any decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities directly affected, rather than being imposed by the government.\n\nWhile some may argue that an amendment is necessary to address a perceived issue, a closer examination reveals that there is no concrete evidence to support the claim that this amendment would have a positive impact on the economy or society. In fact, it's possible that such an amendment could have unintended consequences, including stifling religious diversity and freedom.\n\nIn conclusion, the government should not be involved in declaring certain religious practices as illegal, and any attempt to do so would be a violation of the principles of separation of church and state. The decision regarding religious freedom should be left to the churches and communities, rather than being imposed by the government.",
            "The Iraq War remains a highly debated topic, with many questioning the motives behind the United States' decision to invade the country in 2003. I firmly believe that the government's initial justifications for the war were not entirely transparent, and that the connection between the 9/11 attacks and the invasion of Iraq was overstated.\n\nIn retrospect, it appears that the government played on the emotions of the American people, capitalizing on their outrage following the terrorist attacks of 2001. This led to a lack of critical evaluation of the potential consequences of invading Iraq. As someone who is generally opposed to war, especially preemptive strikes, I was skeptical of the decision from the outset.\n\nThe parallels between the Iraq War and the Vietnam War are striking. Both conflicts involve attempts to impose democracy on foreign nations, often with disastrous results. The removal of the Iraqi government and the subsequent power vacuum led to chaos and instability, which the US was not adequately prepared to handle. This echoes the lessons of Vietnam, where the US struggled to establish a stable government and ultimately withdrew.\n\nThe war has resulted in a significant loss of American lives, with many soldiers continuing to die in a conflict that has been ongoing for nearly a decade. The US government underestimated the complexity of rebuilding a nation and establishing a functioning democracy. This is a process that requires time, effort, and resources, as exemplified by the struggles our own country faced in its transition to democracy.\n\nMoreover, the US government's decision to invade Iraq raises questions about its motivations. While the stated goal was to promote democracy, many believe that the primary driver was access to Iraq's oil reserves. The lack of evidence for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, coupled with the fact that the US has not taken similar action against other nations with similar capabilities, such as North Korea, further fuels these suspicions.\n\nUltimately, the decision to go to war in Iraq was likely based on a mix of factors, including a desire to expand US influence and secure access to valuable resources. As the conflict continues to drag on, it is essential to re-evaluate the government's decision-making process and consider the long-term consequences of their actions.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I was torn between supporting the incumbent, George Bush, and opposing the war. While I initially believed that allowing him to complete his term was the right decision, the ongoing conflict and the continued loss of American lives have made me question this stance. The war has become a protracted and complex issue, with no clear end in sight. As the US continues to invest significant resources in the conflict, it is essential to consider the human cost and the potential long-term benefits of a US withdrawal.",
            "I would like to express my support for the legalization of same-sex marriage. My stance on this issue has been consistent throughout my life, and I firmly believe that marriage is a personal preference that should not be dictated by societal norms or external factors.\n\nRecent studies have shed light on the possibility that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological factors, rather than solely by societal conditioning. This realization has led me to reconsider the notion that individuals should be denied rights based on their sexual orientation, which is often beyond their control.\n\nI believe that it is inhumane to deny individuals the right to marry based on their sexual orientation, and I have always been an advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage. In my opinion, the role of government and politics should be limited to protecting individual rights, rather than imposing moral or societal values.\n\nIn my community, I have observed that same-sex couples function just like any other family unit, participating in everyday activities and contributing to their communities. It is disconcerting to see politicians attempting to redefine the concept of marriage to suit their own values, rather than respecting the diversity of human relationships.\n\nResearch suggests that sexual orientation may be influenced by a complex interplay of genetic and environmental factors, rather than purely by societal upbringing. This understanding has led me to question the notion that same-sex attraction is a choice, and to recognize the importance of equal rights for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation.\n\nUltimately, I believe that marriage is a personal matter that should be between the individuals involved, rather than a public or political issue. Just as individuals are free to get married without public fanfare, same-sex couples should have the same right to enter into a committed partnership without fear of public scrutiny or judgment.",
            "There are certain expectations that come with posting content online. Once something is published on the internet, it becomes a public forum that anyone can access. As someone who has experience with this in a residential setting, I can attest to the fact that online activities can significantly impact how people perceive individuals.\n\nWhen discussing sensitive topics such as violence or threats, it's crucial to consider the potential consequences of sharing them online. What may seem like a joke or a harmless comment to the poster can be misconstrued by others, potentially leading to serious repercussions.\n\nIn a school setting, if a student posts something alarming, it's not uncommon for school officials to investigate the situation further. This is often done to ensure the safety and well-being of students and staff. While it's essential to respect students' online privacy, there are instances where school administrators may need to intervene.\n\nFor example, if a student posts something that raises concerns about their mental health or intentions, it's the school's responsibility to address the situation. This can be done without infringing on the student's privacy, as the information was shared publicly. However, it's also crucial to note that not all online activity warrants intervention.\n\nSchool officials should not engage in excessive monitoring of students' online activities, such as friending them on social media or tracking their phone conversations. If concerns are brought to their attention, it's essential to handle them in a thoughtful and respectful manner.\n\nA similar principle applies to residential advisors like myself. While it's not necessary to be friends with residents on social media, we must be prepared to address any issues that arise from their online activity. This can be a delicate balance between respecting students' privacy and ensuring their safety.\n\nUltimately, it's essential to remember that once something is posted online, it's accessible to a wide audience. If you don't want certain information to be shared or don't want people to form a particular opinion about you, it's best to exercise caution when posting online.",
            "The protracted nature of the war has led me to question its original purpose. Initially, the intention was to establish democracy in a country lacking a fair political system, a goal that I believe is noble. However, over time, I fear that the primary motivation has shifted from a desire to promote democracy to a demonstration of military prowess.\n\nLooking back, I think the initial invasion was a powerful statement in itself, sending a clear message about our commitment to democracy. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict has raised concerns about the true reasons behind our involvement. If the primary objective was to establish democracy, it's likely that our efforts would have been more focused and decisive. Instead, it appears that we have become bogged down in a seemingly endless cycle of violence.\n\nIn my opinion, our original motivation was admirable, but it has been compromised by personal and ulterior motives, such as the strained relationship between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. This has led to a war that has become increasingly complex and difficult to justify.\n\nI believe that we have already achieved a significant portion of our goals in the initial stages of the conflict. It's time to reassess our priorities and acknowledge that our continued involvement is no longer justifiable. The war has drained our economy, diverting billions of dollars away from pressing domestic issues such as poverty, education, and healthcare. As a result, I strongly believe that it's time to bring our troops home and allow the country to take ownership of its future.\n\nIt's essential to recognize that war should not be a long-term expenditure in our budget. We have pressing domestic concerns that require attention and funding, such as maintaining public roads, improving education, and providing quality healthcare. The financial burdens of this war have come at a high cost, including the loss of American lives and the erosion of our national funds. It's time for a change in direction and a renewed focus on our own nation's needs.",
            "The question of balancing online privacy with potential consequences is a complex one. If an individual shares personal information on a social networking site, they should be aware that it may be accessible to a wide audience. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, users must accept friend requests from others to view their profiles, thereby granting permission to access their content. This understanding is crucial when contributing to online communities.\n\nHowever, the idea of monitoring students' online profiles to prevent potential harm raises concerns. While it may be possible for someone to stumble upon potentially problematic information, it's impractical and potentially discriminatory to have someone dedicated to scrutinizing individual profiles. The decision to monitor should be based on specific circumstances, such as evidence of suspicious behavior, rather than a general policy.\n\nMy personal experience with social media has taught me to be cautious about sharing personal information. Although I don't maintain a Myspace profile, I do have a Facebook account, and I'm aware of the risks associated with online interactions. A documentary I watched highlighted the ease with which an individual can gather information from social media profiles, which can be used to manipulate others. This has led me to limit the information I share online, while still allowing me to maintain connections with friends.\n\nHowever, I've also come to realize that it's difficult to control who has access to our online presence. Even with privacy settings in place, there's still a risk that others can view our information. This is why I'm careful about accepting friend requests and limit the amount of personal data I share.\n\nA recent conversation with my roommate about her high school experience shed light on the issue of school administrators banning students from using Myspace. While I'm not entirely sure about the reasoning behind this decision, it did raise questions about the extent of authority schools have over students' online activities.\n\nUltimately, the relationship between online privacy and potential consequences is a delicate one. While it's essential to be mindful of the information we share online, it's also crucial to consider the potential impact of blanket policies aimed at monitoring students' online activities.",
            "The Iraq War has been a highly debated topic, with various perspectives emerging over time. Initially, many people, including myself, expressed opposition to the invasion. However, as the situation has evolved, the general consensus worldwide has shifted towards viewing the war as a regrettable decision. This is evident in the overwhelming majority of global polls, which suggest that approximately 75-80% of the international community, including a significant percentage of Iraqi citizens and US troops stationed in Iraq, consider the war to have been a mistake.\n\nThe complexities of the Middle East and the cultural differences between Western and Middle Eastern societies can make it challenging to implement successful democratic reforms. The notion that a foreign power can impose its values and governance structures on a region with a distinct history and cultural identity is a notion that has been questioned by many.\n\nWhile Saddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly problematic, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons before taking military action, particularly when the outcome is uncertain. The rapid escalation of the situation has led to a prolonged and arduous conflict, with numerous challenges and obstacles hindering a swift resolution.\n\nConsidering the prevailing sentiment among the Iraqi population and the international community, it is worth considering the possibility of a gradual withdrawal of US forces over the course of a year or more. This approach would allow for a more measured exit strategy while minimizing potential risks and negative consequences. Notably, a significant portion of Iraqis advocate for an immediate withdrawal, which raises questions about the effectiveness of the current presence.\n\nThe notion that the Iraqi people's decisions should be taken into account is a valid one. If they are telling us to leave, it is essential to consider their perspective and assess the situation objectively. Ultimately, if we were to withdraw and the situation were to deteriorate, we could argue that we had given the Iraqi people the opportunity to make their own decisions and that any negative outcomes would be a result of their choices, not ours.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War has been a multifaceted and intricate issue, with various stakeholders holding different views on its legitimacy and effectiveness. While there are valid arguments on both sides, it seems that a gradual withdrawal of US forces, potentially followed by international assistance, could be a more viable and responsible approach.",
            "One of the most pressing issues in the United States today is the persistence of gender discrimination. While progress has been made in recent years, it remains a significant hurdle in various industries. I firmly believe that societal attitudes and expectations play a substantial role in perpetuating this issue. For instance, in the corporate world, women often face barriers to advancement due to the 'glass ceiling' phenomenon, where despite having the necessary qualifications, they may be overlooked for promotions in favor of male candidates.\n\nThis is not to say that men are immune to discrimination; on the contrary, they too can face difficulties in fields such as fashion, where traditional stereotypes can make it challenging for men to be taken seriously. The notion that men who are interested in fashion are somehow less masculine or less capable can be a significant obstacle to overcome.\n\nMoreover, societal expectations around caregiving roles can also perpetuate gender discrimination. The stigma surrounding men who stay at home to care for their children is still prevalent, with many people viewing it as unconventional or even unnatural. This can lead to feelings of isolation and marginalization for stay-at-home dads, who are often judged for prioritizing family responsibilities over professional ambitions.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where traditional gender roles can be limiting. Men who work in fashion may be subject to skepticism simply because of their gender, with some people questioning their understanding of the industry.\n\nHowever, there are signs that attitudes are slowly shifting. As more women take on leadership roles and break down barriers in the corporate world, and as stay-at-home dads become more accepted, it is becoming clearer that traditional gender roles are no longer the only standard. By promoting the qualities and achievements of individuals who deviate from these norms, we can work towards a more inclusive and accepting society.\n\nIt's also worth noting that discrimination can take many forms, and individuals from different backgrounds may face unique challenges. For example, someone from a rural area may face bias due to their accent or lack of formal education, despite being intelligent and capable. Similarly, individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds may face prejudice based on their language or customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while progress has been made, there is still a long way to go in addressing gender discrimination in the United States. By acknowledging the complexities of the issue and working towards greater understanding and acceptance, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society for all.",
            "My understanding is that while marijuana has not been fully legalized, it has undergone decriminalization, which has downgraded it from a criminal offense to a more akin to a traffic citation. This change involves a less severe outcome, such as receiving a fine rather than facing arrest, booking, and prosecution. Consequently, individuals cited for marijuana possession or use may face fewer consequences in the long run, particularly in terms of job prospects and other professional implications, which can be detrimental to one's future.\n\nHowever, there are varying perspectives on the matter. On one hand, decriminalization can be economically advantageous for municipalities, as it reduces the costs associated with law enforcement, court proceedings, and public defense. This can be a significant concern for financially strained cities, making it a difficult decision to make. In contrast, some communities may be hesitant to adopt such a policy due to philosophical or cultural opposition to marijuana.\n\nDenver, being a more liberal city, has taken a different approach, and it appears to have benefited from the change. As a result, they have redirected funds toward public education, social programs for the elderly, and food programs for the homeless. This shift is a significant step forward, especially considering the economic constraints that many municipalities face.\n\nIt is essential to consider the potential consequences of full legalization, as it could lead to increased availability and visibility of marijuana. This might result in a rise in smoking-related incidents, such as driving under the influence. Moreover, societal norms and stigma surrounding marijuana use still exist, making it a sensitive topic in many contexts.\n\nInterestingly, while marijuana's effects on motor skills are not as pronounced as those of alcohol, its impact on lifestyle can be more profound for some individuals. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that people react differently to substances, and personal characteristics, such as moderation and self-control, play a significant role in determining the outcome. Ultimately, both marijuana and alcohol have their adverse effects, making it challenging to generalize their impact on individuals.",
            "I believe that the Catholic Church's adherence to tradition is a double-edged sword. On one hand, the institution has a rich history and a set of guiding principles that have been upheld for centuries. However, this steadfast commitment to tradition can sometimes make it difficult for the Church to adapt to changing times and circumstances.\n\nOne of the most striking examples of this dilemma is the Church's stance on interfaith marriage. My own family's experience with this issue serves as a stark reminder of the potential consequences of a rigid adherence to doctrine. My parents, one a Catholic and the other an Episcopalian, were unable to marry in the Catholic Church because of the Church's refusal to accept my father's Episcopalian faith.\n\nThis experience has led me to wonder whether the Church's doctrine of love and acceptance can be reconciled with its practice of excluding those who do not conform to its norms. While the Catholic Church teaches that love and acceptance are fundamental principles, its actions often suggest a more limited and exclusive approach. This tension between theory and practice can be a source of frustration and disillusionment, particularly for those who seek a more inclusive and compassionate faith.\n\nRegarding the issue of priests' marriage, I share the view that it would not necessarily address the root causes of pedophilia within the Church. As I see it, the decision to engage in such behavior is a choice that is not directly related to marital status. In fact, my understanding is that individuals who are capable of such actions are likely to continue doing so regardless of their personal circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition is an essential aspect of the Catholic Church, it must be balanced with a willingness to adapt and evolve. The Church's rigid stance on certain issues can sometimes hinder its ability to live up to its core values of love and acceptance. As the Church continues to navigate the complexities of modern society, it is essential that it find a way to reconcile its tradition with its practice, creating a more inclusive and compassionate community for all its members.",
            "In this contentious issue, I find myself grappling with a certain degree of ambivalence. While there are valid arguments on both sides, I hesitate to take a definitive stance, as it's a complex problem that has sparked intense debate and emotional attachment. The delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage is indeed a challenging one to navigate without inadvertently offending certain groups.\n\nOne potential solution could be to reevaluate the way we approach marriage, considering it as a civil union rather than a sacrament. This perspective acknowledges the government's role in recognizing and providing benefits to couples, without imposing its own values or interpretations. By doing so, we can avoid blurring the lines between church and state.\n\nLooking at it from this angle, the distinction between marriage and civil unions becomes more nuanced. It's possible that the government's recognition of marriage as a civil union could be more inclusive, rather than a label imposed by a specific institution. This thought process also raises questions about the role of the government in defining what constitutes a \"valid\" marriage.\n\nIn the context of same-sex marriage, I believe that a civil union approach could provide a more neutral and inclusive framework. It allows the government to acknowledge the union of two consenting adults without imposing its own moral or religious values. Ultimately, the decision to redefine marriage is a matter of personal conviction, but it's essential to approach it with sensitivity and respect for diverse perspectives.\n\nIf a consensus can be reached among the states, it's reasonable to push for federal recognition of civil unions. However, a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage seems premature and unnecessary. The Constitution should be amended to address matters of significant national import, rather than issues that, while contentious, don't warrant such drastic action.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate surrounding marriage and civil unions requires a thoughtful and inclusive approach. By reexamining our assumptions and considering the role of the government in defining marriage, we can work towards a more nuanced understanding that respects the diversity of individual perspectives.",
            "As someone with a Christian upbringing, I've always navigated the topic of homosexuality with a nuanced perspective. Having many close friends who identify as LGBTQ+ has allowed me to form a deeper understanding of their experiences and the complexities surrounding the issue. While I don't feel entirely in alignment with the LGBTQ+ lifestyle myself, I firmly believe in the importance of equality and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities.\n\nIn my opinion, the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the individual states, rather than be dictated by federal law. This approach acknowledges the diversity of opinions and values across different regions, allowing each state to make decisions that reflect the unique needs and concerns of its citizens. By doing so, we can foster a more inclusive and compassionate environment where individuals are free to live their lives without fear of persecution.\n\nI'm aware that some states lean Democratic and others Republican, and it's not surprising that Democratic states tend to be more supportive of LGBTQ+ rights. However, I believe that individuals who choose to reside in a particular state have a responsibility to respect the values and laws that govern their community. By leaving the decision to legalize same-sex marriage to the states, we're allowing local leaders to make informed decisions that prioritize the well-being and happiness of their constituents.\n\nIn the case of former President Bush's stance on gay marriage, I disagree with his efforts to impose a national ban. As the President of the United States, he had a unique platform to shape the country's policies, but I don't believe that his opinions should supersede the autonomy of individual states. In fact, his impending departure from office highlights the impermanence of federal decisions and the importance of allowing states to chart their own course.\n\nUltimately, I believe that certain issues, like same-sex marriage, should be left to the discretion of each state. This approach recognizes the complexity of the issue and the varying values of different communities. By empowering states to make their own decisions, we can create a more inclusive and equitable society where individuals can thrive without fear of discrimination.",
            "The concept of Myspace as a public platform is often misunderstood. Upon reflection, it's clear that anything posted online can be accessed by anyone. This includes school officials, who may be checking for potential security threats, such as students engaging in substance use or other prohibited behaviors.\n\nWhile one may feel uncomfortable with the idea of school officials monitoring online activity, it's essential to acknowledge the school's responsibility to provide a safe environment for its students. In this context, online monitoring can be seen as a necessary measure to prevent incidents like school shootings.\n\nThe idea that school officials might access Myspace profiles outside of their official capacity is also relevant. Even if a student doesn't explicitly state they're associated with the school, their profile can still be discovered through various means, including their home internet connections. \n\nSchool officials may use social media to identify potential issues and address them before they escalate. This proactive approach can help prevent problems and make the school a safer place. In fact, many schools have implemented various safety protocols, such as lockdown drills, to prepare for potential threats.\n\nIn the case of the Myspace monitoring, the school officials' actions can be viewed as a necessary measure to ensure student safety. While it may seem invasive, their primary goal is to prevent harm and create a secure environment for all students.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the internet has a way of holding onto information, making it difficult to erase past online activity. This highlights the importance of being mindful of one's online presence and the potential consequences of posting sensitive information.\n\nIn conclusion, while school officials may seem overzealous in their monitoring, their actions are ultimately aimed at creating a safer environment for students. This may involve accessing social media platforms like Myspace to identify potential issues and prevent harm.",
            "The invasion of Iraq was a decision that I initially supported, largely driven by the personal impact of 9/11 on my life. However, as I reflected further on the situation, I began to question the long-term consequences of our actions. I believe that the emotional response to the attacks led to a lack of careful planning and consideration for the potential outcomes of our involvement.\n\nIn retrospect, it is clear that we entered the conflict without a clear plan for the post-invasion period, which led to unforeseen challenges and setbacks. I think that our initial motivations were driven more by a desire for revenge and a sense of urgency rather than a well-thought-out strategy. The President's decision to declare war on Iraq, while understandable in the context of the time, was also driven by public opinion and a desire for action.\n\nLooking back, I believe that we underestimated the complexity of the situation and the difficulty of imposing our will on a country with such a different cultural and historical context. The concept of war is perceived very differently in Iraq than it is in the US, and our actions were often viewed as an invasion rather than a liberation.\n\nI now believe that our presence in Iraq has not brought about the desired outcome and may have even exacerbated the situation. The ongoing conflict has highlighted the challenges of nation-building and the difficulty of imposing democratic values on a country with a different cultural identity. I think that we should have been more cautious in our approach and considered the long-term implications of our actions.\n\nWhile we have made some progress in Iraq, I believe that our continued presence is not sufficient to achieve lasting stability. I think that our involvement has actually hindered our own interests and that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region. Ultimately, I believe that the people of Iraq must take ownership of their country's future, and we should focus on supporting their efforts rather than trying to impose our will on them.\n\nI also believe that our initial motivations and actions were driven by a desire for revenge rather than a genuine desire to help the Iraqi people. Our actions were seen as an attempt to impose our values and way of life on a country that was not ready or willing to accept them. I think that this approach was misguided and has ultimately led to more harm than good.\n\nIn conclusion, while I initially supported the invasion of Iraq, I now believe that it was a mistake. Our actions were driven by emotion rather than careful planning and consideration, and our continued presence has not brought about the desired outcome. I think that it is time for us to reassess our role in the region and focus on supporting the people of Iraq rather than trying to impose our will on them."
