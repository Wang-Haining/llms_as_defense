            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To my view, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in a few key areas. It has been publicly discussed that the Church is experiencing a decline in membership, and I believe this could be due to its sometimes rigid stance on contemporary societal issues. Concerning matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, the Church holds steadfast views, which, while understandable, can come across as antiquated. If the Church were to embrace more current perspectives, I believe they might find their numbers growing again. Many people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to its views on these subjects, as they no longer align with their personal beliefs. For instance, those who support abortion and same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in an environment where these practices are deemed wrong. The Church's position on these issues is deeply rooted in its history and tradition. However, I don't see any inherent reason why the Church couldn't allow female priests or married priests. While these changes might not have prevented past controversies, they could potentially foster a more inclusive and accepting environment. In my estimation, the Church's dedication to its mission does not preclude it from also nurturing its flock with modern sensibilities.",
            "Certainly, I must preface by stating that I hold no qualms against same-sex marriage. Let us contemplate this matter. Is one's sexual orientation a conscious decision? I believe not. Being born with a particular inclination is hardly a choice one makes. Thus, it seems unjust to hold individuals accountable for their inherent nature. The assertion that only heterosexual unions are permissible while same-sex relationships are not, is, in my opinion, misguided. I have not deeply explored this topic, yet it is evident that the federal government's involvement is unwarranted. It is not a matter of security or moral concern, but rather a personal choice that should be left to the individuals in question.\n\nThe notion that one's sexual orientation is a choice is akin to suggesting that straight people choose to be straight. It is not a decision made, but a state of being. Therefore, it is incorrect to place responsibility on an individual for their sexuality. The federal government should not intervene in what is fundamentally a personal matter. It is not their place to impose their views or to dictate how individuals live their lives. This is not about moral judgment but about respecting the diversity of human nature. The law should not penalize those who are simply being true to themselves.\n\nIn essence, the federal government's involvement is misplaced. It is not a legal or moral responsibility of the state to dictate who can marry whom. It is a matter of personal choice and personal identity, and it is not something that the federal government should be involved in. To do so would be to overstep boundaries and to infringe upon individual rights.",
            "I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage, primarily because the current legal framework fails to account for the depth and complexity of these relationships. Many believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of these unions. The love and commitment between two consenting adults, regardless of their sexual orientation, are fundamentally similar to those shared between heterosexual couples.\n\nFor instance, marriage entitles couples to certain rights and benefits, such as tax breaks and healthcare coverage. When a same-sex couple is denied these rights, it leads to a form of institutionalized discrimination. The argument that marriage is a religious institution is flawed, as marriage is also a civil and legal one, separate from religious doctrine. It is hypocritical to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights while allowing them to form civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of same-sex couples on society, including adoption and community integration, are not supported by empirical evidence. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The federal government should play a pivotal role in ensuring that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have equal rights and protections.\n\nLastly, the opposition to same-sex marriage often hinges on misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked many of these myths, emphasizing that being gay is not a result of psychological trauma or defect. To make informed decisions, we should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or religious beliefs. The government should not dictate morality based on the principles of a particular religious group while ignoring the diverse moral and cultural perspectives of the broader society.",
            "To begin with, I am employed at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It goes without saying that the legality of a substance does not automatically negate its potential benefits, yet I strongly advocate against making it widely accessible to the public. However, for medicinal applications, I am a firm believer in its utility, despite its legal status. The mere fact that a substance is illegal does not make it beneficial. In the realm of pharmacology, we encounter numerous controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which are invaluable in patient care. Denying their benefits based solely on the stigma surrounding marijuana is shortsighted. The key is to embrace the medicinal properties of such substances while maintaining strict regulations to prevent abuse. Unlike alcohol, where overconsumption can lead to detrimental outcomes, marijuana's potential harm is less severe when compared to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. Therefore, gradually normalizing marijuana, starting with its medicinal use and removing the taboo associated with it, could lead to more responsible usage.",
            "The institution of the church has undergone significant modifications to align with the modern era. Its regulations are no longer as stringent as in the past. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with visits to church, and we would all don our finest, including myself. My attire consisted of cute little dresses, matching footwear, and a purse to complement the ensemble. However, my experience has evolved over the years. Now, the church caters to a more contemporary audience, with services tailored to suit the needs of teenagers, lasting a concise thirty minutes. Casual attire has become the norm, especially during summer weekends, where beach attire is not uncommon. Families often arrive late, adding a sense of informality to the proceedings. Even the traditionally formal morning masses have seen a shift towards more relaxed dress codes, with jeans and khakis becoming acceptable. While I acknowledge that this change has been the most noticeable, other aspects of the church remain shrouded in mystery to me. I am unfamiliar with its politics and internal workings.",
            "Initially, I found the original premise acceptable, but I believe the collective shock of the September 11th attacks lingered, and thus, the Iraq War was viewed through a different lens. Early on, the Bush administration linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim later proven false.\n\nThis misrepresentation grates on me, and the Iraq War continues to stir my ire. It seems the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public and has yet to take responsibility for this deception. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, has since expressed skepticism regarding the evidence.\n\nI view this as a dereliction of duty, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially post-September 11th. There's evidence suggesting the younger Bush sought to avenge his father's administration and expand our energy supply, which I find underhanded.\n\nHowever, I believe it's high time we reconsider our involvement. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths, the proposed alternative—a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also presents long-term challenges. The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and the political process faces significant friction.",
            "Let me start by saying that my perspective on the Iraq War is complex and multifaceted. Initially, I was not particularly invested in its progress, given that it was not a declared war in the traditional sense, but rather a response to recent events. My understanding is that it was more of a mission to hold Iraq accountable for suspected involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as to establish a stable, democratic government and ensure access to resources like oil.\n\nHowever, as time has passed, I've grown more critical of our continued presence there. The efforts to establish democracy have been slow and challenging, and I believe that our ongoing involvement is more about maintaining a presence in the region and securing resources than about genuinely helping Iraqis build a better future. I feel that our actions have created a sense of resentment among the local population, and our attempts to impose our values and systems have not necessarily been beneficial.\n\nMoreover, I question the wisdom of continuing a military presence in a region that is deeply divided by cultural, religious, and political beliefs. The situation in Iraq is far from stable and peaceful, and I worry that our continued involvement will only exacerbate the existing conflicts. I believe that it's crucial to reassess our strategy and consider a more nuanced approach that respects local cultures and values while still pursuing our broader geopolitical interests.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the Iraq War are still evolving. I am not convinced that our current approach is the best way to achieve our goals, and I believe that a more diplomatic and culturally sensitive strategy might yield better results in the long run. However, I also acknowledge the challenges involved in withdrawing from a complex and volatile situation.",
            "I must confess, I am not entirely convinced that this matter should be legally or statutorily sanctioned. The Constitution, in its wisdom, established a clear line between the state and religious institutions. I firmly believe it is the prerogative of denominations to regulate such issues.\n\nThe majority of Catholics and Christians, I am informed, are opposed to this. While it may be popular in some regions, such as Boston, the broader consensus among faith communities is against it. It seems to me that this is a matter best left to the discretion of religious bodies rather than the government. The principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American religious tolerance, and any amendment attempting to infringe upon it would be an affront to our founding principles.\n\nFurthermore, I do not see a compelling reason for the government to intervene in this matter. The proposed amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than any tangible benefit to society. I believe that leaving this matter to the individual consciences and the collective judgment of religious institutions would be a more fitting and respectful approach.",
            "The Iraq War\nIn hindsight, I question the American government's candor in communicating the true motivations behind our invasion of Iraq. The government suggested a connection between the 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict, yet this link was tenuous, if not non-existent. They exploited the collective outrage following 9/11 to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003. Personally, I was strongly opposed to the war, especially given the preemptive strike nature. The Iraq War, much like the Vietnam War, was a complex and protracted conflict. The U.S. government removed Iraq's government and attempted to impose a democratic regime, but they did not seem adequately prepared for the aftermath. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were not anticipated, and the U.S. struggled to maintain control and稍微 train local forces.\n\nThe war's similarity to Vietnam is striking. Both conflicts involved trying to install a democratic government in an environment filled with insurgents. The assumption that the process would be swift and successful was naïve. The U.S. underestimated the resilience and complexity of the task at hand, leading to a long and protracted conflict. The U.S. government's decision to engage was problematic, and their failure to plan comprehensive post-invasion strategies was a significant oversight.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to see the Iraq War to its conclusion. However, the high cost in American lives and the potential failure of the mission pose a dilemma. How far should we go to establish a democratic Iraq? The question of whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to see the war through remains unanswered. Additionally, the initial justification for the invasion, the search for weapons of mass destruction, was not borne out. While North Korea, known to possess such weapons, was left untouched, Iraq was invaded. The oil factor cannot be ignored, suggesting a strategic interest beyond democratic altruism.\n\nThe Iraq War is a controversial and complex issue, with no clear resolution in sight. While I hope for peace and stability, I remain skeptical that it will be achieved soon. The U.S. government's handling of the conflict and its motivations have been called into question, and the long-term consequences are still being felt.",
            "I have consistently supported the idea of same-sex marriage. It has always been a matter of personal preference, and I believe that recent scientific evidence points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, which is beyond individual control. I find it inhumane to deny rights based on something that is not controllable. In my neighborhood, we have a few openly gay couples who function as any other family would, and yet, they are not allowed to marry due to societal constraints. I believe it is unfair that our government, especially under Bush's interpretation of marriage, would interfere with personal choices that do not harm others. I've read extensively on the topic and understand that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors rather than upbringing. Marriage, in essence, is a private matter that should not be influenced by government intervention. It should be a personal decision made by individuals, not a public spectacle.",
            "It seems as though you've inadvertently ventured into uncharted waters by posting on the internet. The digital realm is, after all, an open forum. There's no escaping the fact that anything you share online becomes public, and your online persona can shape perceptions about you. For instance, an R.A. position required me to address such issues firsthand. When you share information online, it can influence people's views, and if it's about potentially dangerous topics, it can incite concern. The internet is universally accessible, and if someone at school receives a concerning post, they must act, as neglecting it could lead to unfortunate outcomes. However, discerning what's genuine and what's a prank can be challenging. For instance, a sociology experiment gone awry could seem serious until further context is provided. Thus, if you don't wish for something to be seen or misunderstood, refrain from posting it. It's essential to remember that what you share is your responsibility, and while schools and educators should respect privacy, they must also act when safety is at risk. For example, if a student's post hints at potential harm, it's the school's duty to investigate, even if it involves social media. It's crucial to maintain a healthy boundary regarding online monitoring, such as avoiding friend requests and private messages. However, if a concern is brought to their attention, schools have a responsibility to act, as privacy expectations are already altered when information is shared publicly. After all, it's not our place to police every detail of our residents' lives if it's irrelevant to our tasks.",
            "The conflict has stretched on far too long, I believe. Initially, the aim was commendable, to restore democratic governance in a nation lacking it. However, I suspect that the original intent has been lost over time. It seems we've deviated from our goal, now acting more as a global power display than a genuine effort to democratize. This war may have had personal undertones, given George W. Bush's father's history with Saddam Hussein. If the initial objective was to bring democracy to a repressed people, that could be justified. But with the passage of time, our reasons have become distorted and misguided, mirroring a desire to maintain a prolonged conflict. It's time to end this drawn-out war and redirect our resources to our own pressing issues such as poverty and infrastructure. We're squandering billions on a war that has lost its purpose, while our own citizens face challenges that need immediate attention. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on rebuilding our own country.",
            "Could I inquire about the reasoning behind the prevention?\n\nAh, I believe it was due to someone's online discovery.\n\nOf course, I see\nNo, I don't believe it constitutes a breach of privacy.\n\nOn platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. While you may need to be friends with users to view their profiles, you've essentially granted them permission. Thus, sharing information on the internet implies consent to its visibility.\n\nHowever, it's a challenging situation. While it's impractical for someone to monitor all students' profiles, targeted surveillance could seem discriminatory. Yet, it depends on the context. If the profile was flagged for potential threat or if someone was merely browsing and stumbled upon something concerning, it's understandable.\n\nI myself don't have a Myspace account, but I do use Facebook. I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are individuals who can access personal details about me. I've witnessed a TV program about a man who easily obtained a girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. While I would never meet someone under such circumstances, I've had classmates contact me via instant messenger, knowing my identity despite my limited sharing. They could gather information about my interests, appearance, schedule, and even my friends' details.\n\nI try to limit my posts, but I use it to communicate with friends, so I balance privacy with connectivity. I only accept requests from known individuals, but the uncertainty of unknown viewers remains.\n\nMy roommate shared her high school's experience where students were prohibited from using Myspace. I found this unusual; I'm uncertain of the school's authority to regulate students' online activities.\n\nThis is the only other thought that comes to mind.",

            "I can certainly assert that gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States.\nWhile not exclusively faced by women, the challenges are indeed amplified for them across various sectors of employment.\nThe glass ceiling, a metaphor for the barriers that prevent women from reaching top-level positions, is still a reality.\nSocietal norms and historical prejudices often dictate that men are discouraged from working under women, regardless of qualifications.\nConversely, women may be overlooked for promotions or upper-level positions, as they are not seen as the norm in leadership roles.\nIn industries such as fashion, men can face skepticism about their knowledge of women's styles and preferences, due to societal stereotypes about men in the industry.\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children may face disapproval, as societal expectations often dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\nProgress is undeniable, with more women reaching higher positions and greater acceptance, but change remains slow and incremental.\nPromoting the qualities and successes of individuals who defy stereotypes can aid in shifting societal perceptions, rather than forcefully pushing against ingrained beliefs.\nWhile there is still much to be done, current efforts are heading in the right direction, and further advancement will require patience and persistent effort.\nAdditionally, discrimination can occur between individuals based on their background or region, as some may harbor biases against those from less privileged or rural upbringings, regardless of their intelligence or competence.",
            "The situation seems to be that instead of fully legalizing it, they've opted to decriminalize it. This shift downgrades the infraction from a criminal offense to a minor one, akin to receiving a parking ticket rather than facing imprisonment. Should one be caught and cited, the repercussions, like those resulting from a drug charge, become less severe for job interviews and similar contexts. However, it's important to note that the future ramifications of such charges don't entirely vanish with decriminalization.\n\nMoreover, the cost of arresting, housing, and processing individuals is considerable. Municipalities facing financial strain may not be eager to bear these expenses, even if decriminalization could alleviate financial pressure. In a city like Denver, where the populace tends to lean towards more lenient views, the municipality benefits from reduced costs which can then be reallocated to public education, social programs for the elderly, or food programs for the homeless.\n\nWhile marijuana isn't something that should be widely available, the financial implications are significant. It's not just a matter of legalization affecting everyone equally. Some may continue to view it as taboo, making it less socially acceptable to have it openly available. On the other hand, the effects of substances like alcohol and marijuana can vary greatly from person to person. The impact on motor skills and lifestyle can differ based on individual reactions. Consequently, it's challenging to generalize the effects of such substances, but they certainly have their adverse impacts.",
            "I'd agree that\nA significant portion of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nFor instance, they've maintained these rituals over extended periods\nIt's commendable to anchor oneself in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to embrace adaptability\nMany Catholics believe in weekly church attendance\nWith a stringent adherence to ritualistic norms\nSometimes, this can feel exclusive and unyielding\nIntroducing non-conforming individuals can challenge their doctrines\nFor example, my parents' differing religious backgrounds\nMy father was Episcopalian, my mother Catholic\nTheir union was not blessed within the Catholic Church\nThis approach seems contrary to their teachings of universal love\nBut the reality is, some practices appear antiquated yet persist\n\nI believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial\nBut I'm not convinced it would significantly mitigate issues of pedophilia\nGiven that such actions transcend marital status\nIt's likely such behavior would occur regardless of marital status\nThus, I don’t believe priests’ marital status would be a decisive factor in preventing such incidents",
            "I've yet to formulate a definitive stance on this matter. Both sides have compelling arguments, making it a complex issue. The crux of the debate lies in the delicate balance between church and state, and how to define marriage without causing offense. I believe that, given its nature, marriage should be recognized as a civil union by the government, just as it would for those who have been baptized. This approach avoids the complications of religious undertones and allows for uniform treatment. As for the federalization of marriage laws, it seems logical that all states would need to reach a consensus before such a measure is adopted. However, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. It's not a significant enough cause to warrant such a fundamental change to our constitution. It's simply not critical enough to amend the constitution for this purpose.",
            "I come from a home steeped in religious traditions, so the topic of homosexuality can be somewhat complex for me. I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ+, and while I may not fully align with their lifestyle, I do believe it should be legally recognized. I don't see this as a national issue that should be decided by the federal government. I think each state should have the autonomy to make this decision based on its own values and beliefs.\n\nMany states have diverse political leanings, with some being predominantly democratic and others republican. In a democratic state, it's understandable that there might be a push for LGBTQ+ rights. If you live in a state that chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it's only fair to respect that decision, as you've chosen to reside in that state. It's not about disagreeing with the state's decision but rather acknowledging the autonomy of the community that lives there.\n\nI strongly disagree with the notion that a president, particularly one who may not represent the views of all states, should impose his opinions on the entire nation, especially in matters as personal and diverse as this one. Bush's ban on same-sex marriage, for instance, doesn't align with my beliefs. I believe each state should have the power to decide what's best for its citizens, not a president who will soon be out of office. It would be unfair to leave such a significant decision to a federal power, given that the consequences will directly affect the citizens of that state, not the president himself.\n\nI hold the strong conviction that this matter should be left to the discretion of each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Well, I suppose I should address this point, as it's a significant issue. To begin, it's widely recognized that social media platforms, such as Myspace, are public forums. The very essence of these platforms is to enable individuals to share information with a broader audience, often the public. Hence, it's not an unreasonable expectation from the perspective of the school officials that they might come across such public postings on the internet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of school officials discovering potentially sensitive information, it's important to highlight the ethical balance between privacy and safety. On the one hand, students have a right to express themselves and share their thoughts publicly, as long as they're not violating any rules or laws. On the other hand, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its students, which may extend to monitoring online activities that could pose a threat to the school's security.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the intent behind the monitoring. If the school officials are merely snooping to catch students in potentially harmful activities, such as underage drinking or drug use, then it can indeed be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if their actions are driven by a genuine concern for student safety and to prevent tragedies like school shootings, then it becomes more about maintaining a secure learning environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the ethical line here is drawn when the school's actions align with the broader goal of making the school a safer place for all students. For instance, if the school officials have evidence or leads indicating that students might be at risk of harming themselves or others, their intervention would be justifiable. Conversely, if their actions are solely motivated by the desire to discipline students, it might cross the line into an invasion of privacy.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to understand that the internet is a vast and unforgiving virtual space. Once information is posted, it often stays there, making it difficult to erase or control. Therefore, students should always be cautious about what they share online, as it could potentially come back to haunt them later. This is a pertinent lesson I've learned from my experiences in public schools. We were often reminded about the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment, especially in the wake of tragic events like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that students have a right to privacy, I also believe that the school officials' actions should be guided by a genuine concern for the students' safety. The ultimate goal should be to create a learning environment that is both safe and nurturing, where students feel empowered to express themselves while being protected from potential harm.",
            "In retrospect, the initial sentiment was clear. The September 11th catastrophe was deeply personal. A part of me, caught up in the aftermath, yearned for retaliation. The idea of inflicting similar chaos abroad seemed like a just response. However, hindsight reveals that we may have acted on impulse rather than reason. The decision to intervene was driven by raw emotion, and I believe we underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nOur approach was hasty, lacking a coherent strategy. We entered the conflict unarmed with a comprehensive plan, assuming that our presence would engender order. Regrettably, the opposite occurred. The conflict grew, and our intervention proved ineffective.\n\nThe people we encountered were not merely adversaries but a people entrenched in their own strife. Their internal conflicts clouded their ability to engage with us meaningfully. Moreover, our presence exacerbated their divisions rather than uniting them against a common threat. It became evident that our intervention was not fostering unity but exacerbating divisions.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for military action was misplaced. We were driven by revenge rather than a clear mission. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq, in the heat of the moment, was understandable. Yet, I now question the wisdom of our actions. We failed to formulate a coherent plan for stabilization, and our presence only prolonged the chaos.\n\nThe war in Iraq did not yield the desired results. Our impact was minimal, and the country remains unstable. The notion of bringing democracy to a war-torn region was noble, but our execution was flawed. Our presence only prolonged the conflict and failed to achieve lasting change.\n\nI contend that we are not the agents capable of transforming these people. They must find their own solutions. Our continued presence in Iraq is futile. It is a drain on resources and a distraction from our domestic priorities.\n\nOur involvement has been lengthy, and our progress has been incremental. The situation has not improved significantly, and our continued presence only delays the inevitable. Ultimately, we must recognize that we cannot remain indefinitely. Our presence in Iraq is no longer serving a purpose."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To my view, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in a few key areas. It has been publicly discussed that the Church is experiencing a decline in membership, and I believe this could be due to its sometimes rigid stance on contemporary societal issues. Concerning matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, the Church holds steadfast views, which, while understandable, can come across as antiquated. If the Church were to embrace more current perspectives, I believe they might find their numbers growing again. Many people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to its views on these subjects, as they no longer align with their personal beliefs. For instance, those who support abortion and same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in an environment where these practices are deemed wrong. The Church's position on these issues is deeply rooted in its history and tradition. However, I don't see any inherent reason why the Church couldn't allow female priests or married priests. While these changes might not have prevented past controversies, they could potentially foster a more inclusive and accepting environment. In my estimation, the Church's dedication to its mission does not preclude it from also nurturing its flock with modern sensibilities.",
            "Certainly, I must preface by stating that I hold no qualms against same-sex marriage. Let us contemplate this matter. Is one's sexual orientation a conscious decision? I believe not. Being born with a particular inclination is hardly a choice one makes. Thus, it seems unjust to hold individuals accountable for their inherent nature. The assertion that only heterosexual unions are permissible while same-sex relationships are not, is, in my opinion, misguided. I have not deeply explored this topic, yet it is evident that the federal government's involvement is unwarranted. It is not a matter of security or moral concern, but rather a personal choice that should be left to the individuals in question.\n\nThe notion that one's sexual orientation is a choice is akin to suggesting that straight people choose to be straight. It is not a decision made, but a state of being. Therefore, it is incorrect to place responsibility on an individual for their sexuality. The federal government should not intervene in what is fundamentally a personal matter. It is not their place to impose their views or to dictate how individuals live their lives. This is not about moral judgment but about respecting the diversity of human nature. The law should not penalize those who are simply being true to themselves.\n\nIn essence, the federal government's involvement is misplaced. It is not a legal or moral responsibility of the state to dictate who can marry whom. It is a matter of personal choice and personal identity, and it is not something that the federal government should be involved in. To do so would be to overstep boundaries and to infringe upon individual rights.",
            "I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage, primarily because the current legal framework fails to account for the depth and complexity of these relationships. Many believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of these unions. The love and commitment between two consenting adults, regardless of their sexual orientation, are fundamentally similar to those shared between heterosexual couples.\n\nFor instance, marriage entitles couples to certain rights and benefits, such as tax breaks and healthcare coverage. When a same-sex couple is denied these rights, it leads to a form of institutionalized discrimination. The argument that marriage is a religious institution is flawed, as marriage is also a civil and legal one, separate from religious doctrine. It is hypocritical to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights while allowing them to form civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of same-sex couples on society, including adoption and community integration, are not supported by empirical evidence. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The federal government should play a pivotal role in ensuring that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have equal rights and protections.\n\nLastly, the opposition to same-sex marriage often hinges on misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked many of these myths, emphasizing that being gay is not a result of psychological trauma or defect. To make informed decisions, we should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or religious beliefs. The government should not dictate morality based on the principles of a particular religious group while ignoring the diverse moral and cultural perspectives of the broader society.",
            "To begin with, I am employed at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It goes without saying that the legality of a substance does not automatically negate its potential benefits, yet I strongly advocate against making it widely accessible to the public. However, for medicinal applications, I am a firm believer in its utility, despite its legal status. The mere fact that a substance is illegal does not make it beneficial. In the realm of pharmacology, we encounter numerous controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which are invaluable in patient care. Denying their benefits based solely on the stigma surrounding marijuana is shortsighted. The key is to embrace the medicinal properties of such substances while maintaining strict regulations to prevent abuse. Unlike alcohol, where overconsumption can lead to detrimental outcomes, marijuana's potential harm is less severe when compared to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. Therefore, gradually normalizing marijuana, starting with its medicinal use and removing the taboo associated with it, could lead to more responsible usage.",
            "The institution of the church has undergone significant modifications to align with the modern era. Its regulations are no longer as stringent as in the past. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with visits to church, and we would all don our finest, including myself. My attire consisted of cute little dresses, matching footwear, and a purse to complement the ensemble. However, my experience has evolved over the years. Now, the church caters to a more contemporary audience, with services tailored to suit the needs of teenagers, lasting a concise thirty minutes. Casual attire has become the norm, especially during summer weekends, where beach attire is not uncommon. Families often arrive late, adding a sense of informality to the proceedings. Even the traditionally formal morning masses have seen a shift towards more relaxed dress codes, with jeans and khakis becoming acceptable. While I acknowledge that this change has been the most noticeable, other aspects of the church remain shrouded in mystery to me. I am unfamiliar with its politics and internal workings.",
            "Initially, I found the original premise acceptable, but I believe the collective shock of the September 11th attacks lingered, and thus, the Iraq War was viewed through a different lens. Early on, the Bush administration linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim later proven false.\n\nThis misrepresentation grates on me, and the Iraq War continues to stir my ire. It seems the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public and has yet to take responsibility for this deception. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, has since expressed skepticism regarding the evidence.\n\nI view this as a dereliction of duty, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially post-September 11th. There's evidence suggesting the younger Bush sought to avenge his father's administration and expand our energy supply, which I find underhanded.\n\nHowever, I believe it's high time we reconsider our involvement. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths, the proposed alternative—a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also presents long-term challenges. The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and the political process faces significant friction.",
            "Let me start by saying that my perspective on the Iraq War is complex and multifaceted. Initially, I was not particularly invested in its progress, given that it was not a declared war in the traditional sense, but rather a response to recent events. My understanding is that it was more of a mission to hold Iraq accountable for suspected involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as to establish a stable, democratic government and ensure access to resources like oil.\n\nHowever, as time has passed, I've grown more critical of our continued presence there. The efforts to establish democracy have been slow and challenging, and I believe that our ongoing involvement is more about maintaining a presence in the region and securing resources than about genuinely helping Iraqis build a better future. I feel that our actions have created a sense of resentment among the local population, and our attempts to impose our values and systems have not necessarily been beneficial.\n\nMoreover, I question the wisdom of continuing a military presence in a region that is deeply divided by cultural, religious, and political beliefs. The situation in Iraq is far from stable and peaceful, and I worry that our continued involvement will only exacerbate the existing conflicts. I believe that it's crucial to reassess our strategy and consider a more nuanced approach that respects local cultures and values while still pursuing our broader geopolitical interests.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the Iraq War are still evolving. I am not convinced that our current approach is the best way to achieve our goals, and I believe that a more diplomatic and culturally sensitive strategy might yield better results in the long run. However, I also acknowledge the challenges involved in withdrawing from a complex and volatile situation.",
            "I must confess, I am not entirely convinced that this matter should be legally or statutorily sanctioned. The Constitution, in its wisdom, established a clear line between the state and religious institutions. I firmly believe it is the prerogative of denominations to regulate such issues.\n\nThe majority of Catholics and Christians, I am informed, are opposed to this. While it may be popular in some regions, such as Boston, the broader consensus among faith communities is against it. It seems to me that this is a matter best left to the discretion of religious bodies rather than the government. The principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American religious tolerance, and any amendment attempting to infringe upon it would be an affront to our founding principles.\n\nFurthermore, I do not see a compelling reason for the government to intervene in this matter. The proposed amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than any tangible benefit to society. I believe that leaving this matter to the individual consciences and the collective judgment of religious institutions would be a more fitting and respectful approach.",
            "The Iraq War\nIn hindsight, I question the American government's candor in communicating the true motivations behind our invasion of Iraq. The government suggested a connection between the 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict, yet this link was tenuous, if not non-existent. They exploited the collective outrage following 9/11 to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003. Personally, I was strongly opposed to the war, especially given the preemptive strike nature. The Iraq War, much like the Vietnam War, was a complex and protracted conflict. The U.S. government removed Iraq's government and attempted to impose a democratic regime, but they did not seem adequately prepared for the aftermath. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were not anticipated, and the U.S. struggled to maintain control and稍微 train local forces.\n\nThe war's similarity to Vietnam is striking. Both conflicts involved trying to install a democratic government in an environment filled with insurgents. The assumption that the process would be swift and successful was naïve. The U.S. underestimated the resilience and complexity of the task at hand, leading to a long and protracted conflict. The U.S. government's decision to engage was problematic, and their failure to plan comprehensive post-invasion strategies was a significant oversight.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to see the Iraq War to its conclusion. However, the high cost in American lives and the potential failure of the mission pose a dilemma. How far should we go to establish a democratic Iraq? The question of whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to see the war through remains unanswered. Additionally, the initial justification for the invasion, the search for weapons of mass destruction, was not borne out. While North Korea, known to possess such weapons, was left untouched, Iraq was invaded. The oil factor cannot be ignored, suggesting a strategic interest beyond democratic altruism.\n\nThe Iraq War is a controversial and complex issue, with no clear resolution in sight. While I hope for peace and stability, I remain skeptical that it will be achieved soon. The U.S. government's handling of the conflict and its motivations have been called into question, and the long-term consequences are still being felt.",
            "I have consistently supported the idea of same-sex marriage. It has always been a matter of personal preference, and I believe that recent scientific evidence points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, which is beyond individual control. I find it inhumane to deny rights based on something that is not controllable. In my neighborhood, we have a few openly gay couples who function as any other family would, and yet, they are not allowed to marry due to societal constraints. I believe it is unfair that our government, especially under Bush's interpretation of marriage, would interfere with personal choices that do not harm others. I've read extensively on the topic and understand that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors rather than upbringing. Marriage, in essence, is a private matter that should not be influenced by government intervention. It should be a personal decision made by individuals, not a public spectacle.",
            "It seems as though you've inadvertently ventured into uncharted waters by posting on the internet. The digital realm is, after all, an open forum. There's no escaping the fact that anything you share online becomes public, and your online persona can shape perceptions about you. For instance, an R.A. position required me to address such issues firsthand. When you share information online, it can influence people's views, and if it's about potentially dangerous topics, it can incite concern. The internet is universally accessible, and if someone at school receives a concerning post, they must act, as neglecting it could lead to unfortunate outcomes. However, discerning what's genuine and what's a prank can be challenging. For instance, a sociology experiment gone awry could seem serious until further context is provided. Thus, if you don't wish for something to be seen or misunderstood, refrain from posting it. It's essential to remember that what you share is your responsibility, and while schools and educators should respect privacy, they must also act when safety is at risk. For example, if a student's post hints at potential harm, it's the school's duty to investigate, even if it involves social media. It's crucial to maintain a healthy boundary regarding online monitoring, such as avoiding friend requests and private messages. However, if a concern is brought to their attention, schools have a responsibility to act, as privacy expectations are already altered when information is shared publicly. After all, it's not our place to police every detail of our residents' lives if it's irrelevant to our tasks.",
            "The conflict has stretched on far too long, I believe. Initially, the aim was commendable, to restore democratic governance in a nation lacking it. However, I suspect that the original intent has been lost over time. It seems we've deviated from our goal, now acting more as a global power display than a genuine effort to democratize. This war may have had personal undertones, given George W. Bush's father's history with Saddam Hussein. If the initial objective was to bring democracy to a repressed people, that could be justified. But with the passage of time, our reasons have become distorted and misguided, mirroring a desire to maintain a prolonged conflict. It's time to end this drawn-out war and redirect our resources to our own pressing issues such as poverty and infrastructure. We're squandering billions on a war that has lost its purpose, while our own citizens face challenges that need immediate attention. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on rebuilding our own country.",
            "Could I inquire about the reasoning behind the prevention?\n\nAh, I believe it was due to someone's online discovery.\n\nOf course, I see\nNo, I don't believe it constitutes a breach of privacy.\n\nOn platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. While you may need to be friends with users to view their profiles, you've essentially granted them permission. Thus, sharing information on the internet implies consent to its visibility.\n\nHowever, it's a challenging situation. While it's impractical for someone to monitor all students' profiles, targeted surveillance could seem discriminatory. Yet, it depends on the context. If the profile was flagged for potential threat or if someone was merely browsing and stumbled upon something concerning, it's understandable.\n\nI myself don't have a Myspace account, but I do use Facebook. I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are individuals who can access personal details about me. I've witnessed a TV program about a man who easily obtained a girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. While I would never meet someone under such circumstances, I've had classmates contact me via instant messenger, knowing my identity despite my limited sharing. They could gather information about my interests, appearance, schedule, and even my friends' details.\n\nI try to limit my posts, but I use it to communicate with friends, so I balance privacy with connectivity. I only accept requests from known individuals, but the uncertainty of unknown viewers remains.\n\nMy roommate shared her high school's experience where students were prohibited from using Myspace. I found this unusual; I'm uncertain of the school's authority to regulate students' online activities.\n\nThis is the only other thought that comes to mind.",

            "The situation seems to be that instead of fully legalizing it, they've opted to decriminalize it. This shift downgrades the infraction from a criminal offense to a minor one, akin to receiving a parking ticket rather than facing imprisonment. Should one be caught and cited, the repercussions, like those resulting from a drug charge, become less severe for job interviews and similar contexts. However, it's important to note that the future ramifications of such charges don't entirely vanish with decriminalization.\n\nMoreover, the cost of arresting, housing, and processing individuals is considerable. Municipalities facing financial strain may not be eager to bear these expenses, even if decriminalization could alleviate financial pressure. In a city like Denver, where the populace tends to lean towards more lenient views, the municipality benefits from reduced costs which can then be reallocated to public education, social programs for the elderly, or food programs for the homeless.\n\nWhile marijuana isn't something that should be widely available, the financial implications are significant. It's not just a matter of legalization affecting everyone equally. Some may continue to view it as taboo, making it less socially acceptable to have it openly available. On the other hand, the effects of substances like alcohol and marijuana can vary greatly from person to person. The impact on motor skills and lifestyle can differ based on individual reactions. Consequently, it's challenging to generalize the effects of such substances, but they certainly have their adverse impacts.",
            "I'd agree that\nA significant portion of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nFor instance, they've maintained these rituals over extended periods\nIt's commendable to anchor oneself in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to embrace adaptability\nMany Catholics believe in weekly church attendance\nWith a stringent adherence to ritualistic norms\nSometimes, this can feel exclusive and unyielding\nIntroducing non-conforming individuals can challenge their doctrines\nFor example, my parents' differing religious backgrounds\nMy father was Episcopalian, my mother Catholic\nTheir union was not blessed within the Catholic Church\nThis approach seems contrary to their teachings of universal love\nBut the reality is, some practices appear antiquated yet persist\n\nI believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial\nBut I'm not convinced it would significantly mitigate issues of pedophilia\nGiven that such actions transcend marital status\nIt's likely such behavior would occur regardless of marital status\nThus, I don’t believe priests’ marital status would be a decisive factor in preventing such incidents",
            "I've yet to formulate a definitive stance on this matter. Both sides have compelling arguments, making it a complex issue. The crux of the debate lies in the delicate balance between church and state, and how to define marriage without causing offense. I believe that, given its nature, marriage should be recognized as a civil union by the government, just as it would for those who have been baptized. This approach avoids the complications of religious undertones and allows for uniform treatment. As for the federalization of marriage laws, it seems logical that all states would need to reach a consensus before such a measure is adopted. However, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. It's not a significant enough cause to warrant such a fundamental change to our constitution. It's simply not critical enough to amend the constitution for this purpose.",
            "I come from a home steeped in religious traditions, so the topic of homosexuality can be somewhat complex for me. I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ+, and while I may not fully align with their lifestyle, I do believe it should be legally recognized. I don't see this as a national issue that should be decided by the federal government. I think each state should have the autonomy to make this decision based on its own values and beliefs.\n\nMany states have diverse political leanings, with some being predominantly democratic and others republican. In a democratic state, it's understandable that there might be a push for LGBTQ+ rights. If you live in a state that chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it's only fair to respect that decision, as you've chosen to reside in that state. It's not about disagreeing with the state's decision but rather acknowledging the autonomy of the community that lives there.\n\nI strongly disagree with the notion that a president, particularly one who may not represent the views of all states, should impose his opinions on the entire nation, especially in matters as personal and diverse as this one. Bush's ban on same-sex marriage, for instance, doesn't align with my beliefs. I believe each state should have the power to decide what's best for its citizens, not a president who will soon be out of office. It would be unfair to leave such a significant decision to a federal power, given that the consequences will directly affect the citizens of that state, not the president himself.\n\nI hold the strong conviction that this matter should be left to the discretion of each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Well, I suppose I should address this point, as it's a significant issue. To begin, it's widely recognized that social media platforms, such as Myspace, are public forums. The very essence of these platforms is to enable individuals to share information with a broader audience, often the public. Hence, it's not an unreasonable expectation from the perspective of the school officials that they might come across such public postings on the internet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of school officials discovering potentially sensitive information, it's important to highlight the ethical balance between privacy and safety. On the one hand, students have a right to express themselves and share their thoughts publicly, as long as they're not violating any rules or laws. On the other hand, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its students, which may extend to monitoring online activities that could pose a threat to the school's security.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the intent behind the monitoring. If the school officials are merely snooping to catch students in potentially harmful activities, such as underage drinking or drug use, then it can indeed be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if their actions are driven by a genuine concern for student safety and to prevent tragedies like school shootings, then it becomes more about maintaining a secure learning environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the ethical line here is drawn when the school's actions align with the broader goal of making the school a safer place for all students. For instance, if the school officials have evidence or leads indicating that students might be at risk of harming themselves or others, their intervention would be justifiable. Conversely, if their actions are solely motivated by the desire to discipline students, it might cross the line into an invasion of privacy.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to understand that the internet is a vast and unforgiving virtual space. Once information is posted, it often stays there, making it difficult to erase or control. Therefore, students should always be cautious about what they share online, as it could potentially come back to haunt them later. This is a pertinent lesson I've learned from my experiences in public schools. We were often reminded about the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment, especially in the wake of tragic events like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that students have a right to privacy, I also believe that the school officials' actions should be guided by a genuine concern for the students' safety. The ultimate goal should be to create a learning environment that is both safe and nurturing, where students feel empowered to express themselves while being protected from potential harm.",
            "In retrospect, the initial sentiment was clear. The September 11th catastrophe was deeply personal. A part of me, caught up in the aftermath, yearned for retaliation. The idea of inflicting similar chaos abroad seemed like a just response. However, hindsight reveals that we may have acted on impulse rather than reason. The decision to intervene was driven by raw emotion, and I believe we underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nOur approach was hasty, lacking a coherent strategy. We entered the conflict unarmed with a comprehensive plan, assuming that our presence would engender order. Regrettably, the opposite occurred. The conflict grew, and our intervention proved ineffective.\n\nThe people we encountered were not merely adversaries but a people entrenched in their own strife. Their internal conflicts clouded their ability to engage with us meaningfully. Moreover, our presence exacerbated their divisions rather than uniting them against a common threat. It became evident that our intervention was not fostering unity but exacerbating divisions.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for military action was misplaced. We were driven by revenge rather than a clear mission. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq, in the heat of the moment, was understandable. Yet, I now question the wisdom of our actions. We failed to formulate a coherent plan for stabilization, and our presence only prolonged the chaos.\n\nThe war in Iraq did not yield the desired results. Our impact was minimal, and the country remains unstable. The notion of bringing democracy to a war-torn region was noble, but our execution was flawed. Our presence only prolonged the conflict and failed to achieve lasting change.\n\nI contend that we are not the agents capable of transforming these people. They must find their own solutions. Our continued presence in Iraq is futile. It is a drain on resources and a distraction from our domestic priorities.\n\nOur involvement has been lengthy, and our progress has been incremental. The situation has not improved significantly, and our continued presence only delays the inevitable. Ultimately, we must recognize that we cannot remain indefinitely. Our presence in Iraq is no longer serving a purpose."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To my view, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in a few key areas. It has been publicly discussed that the Church is experiencing a decline in membership, and I believe this could be due to its sometimes rigid stance on contemporary societal issues. Concerning matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, the Church holds steadfast views, which, while understandable, can come across as antiquated. If the Church were to embrace more current perspectives, I believe they might find their numbers growing again. Many people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to its views on these subjects, as they no longer align with their personal beliefs. For instance, those who support abortion and same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in an environment where these practices are deemed wrong. The Church's position on these issues is deeply rooted in its history and tradition. However, I don't see any inherent reason why the Church couldn't allow female priests or married priests. While these changes might not have prevented past controversies, they could potentially foster a more inclusive and accepting environment. In my estimation, the Church's dedication to its mission does not preclude it from also nurturing its flock with modern sensibilities.",
            "Certainly, I must preface by stating that I hold no qualms against same-sex marriage. Let us contemplate this matter. Is one's sexual orientation a conscious decision? I believe not. Being born with a particular inclination is hardly a choice one makes. Thus, it seems unjust to hold individuals accountable for their inherent nature. The assertion that only heterosexual unions are permissible while same-sex relationships are not, is, in my opinion, misguided. I have not deeply explored this topic, yet it is evident that the federal government's involvement is unwarranted. It is not a matter of security or moral concern, but rather a personal choice that should be left to the individuals in question.\n\nThe notion that one's sexual orientation is a choice is akin to suggesting that straight people choose to be straight. It is not a decision made, but a state of being. Therefore, it is incorrect to place responsibility on an individual for their sexuality. The federal government should not intervene in what is fundamentally a personal matter. It is not their place to impose their views or to dictate how individuals live their lives. This is not about moral judgment but about respecting the diversity of human nature. The law should not penalize those who are simply being true to themselves.\n\nIn essence, the federal government's involvement is misplaced. It is not a legal or moral responsibility of the state to dictate who can marry whom. It is a matter of personal choice and personal identity, and it is not something that the federal government should be involved in. To do so would be to overstep boundaries and to infringe upon individual rights.",
            "I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage, primarily because the current legal framework fails to account for the depth and complexity of these relationships. Many believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of these unions. The love and commitment between two consenting adults, regardless of their sexual orientation, are fundamentally similar to those shared between heterosexual couples.\n\nFor instance, marriage entitles couples to certain rights and benefits, such as tax breaks and healthcare coverage. When a same-sex couple is denied these rights, it leads to a form of institutionalized discrimination. The argument that marriage is a religious institution is flawed, as marriage is also a civil and legal one, separate from religious doctrine. It is hypocritical to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights while allowing them to form civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of same-sex couples on society, including adoption and community integration, are not supported by empirical evidence. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The federal government should play a pivotal role in ensuring that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have equal rights and protections.\n\nLastly, the opposition to same-sex marriage often hinges on misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked many of these myths, emphasizing that being gay is not a result of psychological trauma or defect. To make informed decisions, we should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or religious beliefs. The government should not dictate morality based on the principles of a particular religious group while ignoring the diverse moral and cultural perspectives of the broader society.",
            "To begin with, I am employed at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It goes without saying that the legality of a substance does not automatically negate its potential benefits, yet I strongly advocate against making it widely accessible to the public. However, for medicinal applications, I am a firm believer in its utility, despite its legal status. The mere fact that a substance is illegal does not make it beneficial. In the realm of pharmacology, we encounter numerous controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which are invaluable in patient care. Denying their benefits based solely on the stigma surrounding marijuana is shortsighted. The key is to embrace the medicinal properties of such substances while maintaining strict regulations to prevent abuse. Unlike alcohol, where overconsumption can lead to detrimental outcomes, marijuana's potential harm is less severe when compared to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. Therefore, gradually normalizing marijuana, starting with its medicinal use and removing the taboo associated with it, could lead to more responsible usage.",
            "The institution of the church has undergone significant modifications to align with the modern era. Its regulations are no longer as stringent as in the past. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with visits to church, and we would all don our finest, including myself. My attire consisted of cute little dresses, matching footwear, and a purse to complement the ensemble. However, my experience has evolved over the years. Now, the church caters to a more contemporary audience, with services tailored to suit the needs of teenagers, lasting a concise thirty minutes. Casual attire has become the norm, especially during summer weekends, where beach attire is not uncommon. Families often arrive late, adding a sense of informality to the proceedings. Even the traditionally formal morning masses have seen a shift towards more relaxed dress codes, with jeans and khakis becoming acceptable. While I acknowledge that this change has been the most noticeable, other aspects of the church remain shrouded in mystery to me. I am unfamiliar with its politics and internal workings.",
            "Initially, I found the original premise acceptable, but I believe the collective shock of the September 11th attacks lingered, and thus, the Iraq War was viewed through a different lens. Early on, the Bush administration linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim later proven false.\n\nThis misrepresentation grates on me, and the Iraq War continues to stir my ire. It seems the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public and has yet to take responsibility for this deception. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, has since expressed skepticism regarding the evidence.\n\nI view this as a dereliction of duty, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially post-September 11th. There's evidence suggesting the younger Bush sought to avenge his father's administration and expand our energy supply, which I find underhanded.\n\nHowever, I believe it's high time we reconsider our involvement. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths, the proposed alternative—a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also presents long-term challenges. The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and the political process faces significant friction.",
            "Let me start by saying that my perspective on the Iraq War is complex and multifaceted. Initially, I was not particularly invested in its progress, given that it was not a declared war in the traditional sense, but rather a response to recent events. My understanding is that it was more of a mission to hold Iraq accountable for suspected involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as to establish a stable, democratic government and ensure access to resources like oil.\n\nHowever, as time has passed, I've grown more critical of our continued presence there. The efforts to establish democracy have been slow and challenging, and I believe that our ongoing involvement is more about maintaining a presence in the region and securing resources than about genuinely helping Iraqis build a better future. I feel that our actions have created a sense of resentment among the local population, and our attempts to impose our values and systems have not necessarily been beneficial.\n\nMoreover, I question the wisdom of continuing a military presence in a region that is deeply divided by cultural, religious, and political beliefs. The situation in Iraq is far from stable and peaceful, and I worry that our continued involvement will only exacerbate the existing conflicts. I believe that it's crucial to reassess our strategy and consider a more nuanced approach that respects local cultures and values while still pursuing our broader geopolitical interests.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the Iraq War are still evolving. I am not convinced that our current approach is the best way to achieve our goals, and I believe that a more diplomatic and culturally sensitive strategy might yield better results in the long run. However, I also acknowledge the challenges involved in withdrawing from a complex and volatile situation.",
            "I must confess, I am not entirely convinced that this matter should be legally or statutorily sanctioned. The Constitution, in its wisdom, established a clear line between the state and religious institutions. I firmly believe it is the prerogative of denominations to regulate such issues.\n\nThe majority of Catholics and Christians, I am informed, are opposed to this. While it may be popular in some regions, such as Boston, the broader consensus among faith communities is against it. It seems to me that this is a matter best left to the discretion of religious bodies rather than the government. The principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American religious tolerance, and any amendment attempting to infringe upon it would be an affront to our founding principles.\n\nFurthermore, I do not see a compelling reason for the government to intervene in this matter. The proposed amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than any tangible benefit to society. I believe that leaving this matter to the individual consciences and the collective judgment of religious institutions would be a more fitting and respectful approach.",
            "The Iraq War\nIn hindsight, I question the American government's candor in communicating the true motivations behind our invasion of Iraq. The government suggested a connection between the 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict, yet this link was tenuous, if not non-existent. They exploited the collective outrage following 9/11 to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003. Personally, I was strongly opposed to the war, especially given the preemptive strike nature. The Iraq War, much like the Vietnam War, was a complex and protracted conflict. The U.S. government removed Iraq's government and attempted to impose a democratic regime, but they did not seem adequately prepared for the aftermath. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were not anticipated, and the U.S. struggled to maintain control and稍微 train local forces.\n\nThe war's similarity to Vietnam is striking. Both conflicts involved trying to install a democratic government in an environment filled with insurgents. The assumption that the process would be swift and successful was naïve. The U.S. underestimated the resilience and complexity of the task at hand, leading to a long and protracted conflict. The U.S. government's decision to engage was problematic, and their failure to plan comprehensive post-invasion strategies was a significant oversight.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to see the Iraq War to its conclusion. However, the high cost in American lives and the potential failure of the mission pose a dilemma. How far should we go to establish a democratic Iraq? The question of whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to see the war through remains unanswered. Additionally, the initial justification for the invasion, the search for weapons of mass destruction, was not borne out. While North Korea, known to possess such weapons, was left untouched, Iraq was invaded. The oil factor cannot be ignored, suggesting a strategic interest beyond democratic altruism.\n\nThe Iraq War is a controversial and complex issue, with no clear resolution in sight. While I hope for peace and stability, I remain skeptical that it will be achieved soon. The U.S. government's handling of the conflict and its motivations have been called into question, and the long-term consequences are still being felt.",
            "I have consistently supported the idea of same-sex marriage. It has always been a matter of personal preference, and I believe that recent scientific evidence points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, which is beyond individual control. I find it inhumane to deny rights based on something that is not controllable. In my neighborhood, we have a few openly gay couples who function as any other family would, and yet, they are not allowed to marry due to societal constraints. I believe it is unfair that our government, especially under Bush's interpretation of marriage, would interfere with personal choices that do not harm others. I've read extensively on the topic and understand that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors rather than upbringing. Marriage, in essence, is a private matter that should not be influenced by government intervention. It should be a personal decision made by individuals, not a public spectacle.",
            "It seems as though you've inadvertently ventured into uncharted waters by posting on the internet. The digital realm is, after all, an open forum. There's no escaping the fact that anything you share online becomes public, and your online persona can shape perceptions about you. For instance, an R.A. position required me to address such issues firsthand. When you share information online, it can influence people's views, and if it's about potentially dangerous topics, it can incite concern. The internet is universally accessible, and if someone at school receives a concerning post, they must act, as neglecting it could lead to unfortunate outcomes. However, discerning what's genuine and what's a prank can be challenging. For instance, a sociology experiment gone awry could seem serious until further context is provided. Thus, if you don't wish for something to be seen or misunderstood, refrain from posting it. It's essential to remember that what you share is your responsibility, and while schools and educators should respect privacy, they must also act when safety is at risk. For example, if a student's post hints at potential harm, it's the school's duty to investigate, even if it involves social media. It's crucial to maintain a healthy boundary regarding online monitoring, such as avoiding friend requests and private messages. However, if a concern is brought to their attention, schools have a responsibility to act, as privacy expectations are already altered when information is shared publicly. After all, it's not our place to police every detail of our residents' lives if it's irrelevant to our tasks.",
            "The conflict has stretched on far too long, I believe. Initially, the aim was commendable, to restore democratic governance in a nation lacking it. However, I suspect that the original intent has been lost over time. It seems we've deviated from our goal, now acting more as a global power display than a genuine effort to democratize. This war may have had personal undertones, given George W. Bush's father's history with Saddam Hussein. If the initial objective was to bring democracy to a repressed people, that could be justified. But with the passage of time, our reasons have become distorted and misguided, mirroring a desire to maintain a prolonged conflict. It's time to end this drawn-out war and redirect our resources to our own pressing issues such as poverty and infrastructure. We're squandering billions on a war that has lost its purpose, while our own citizens face challenges that need immediate attention. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on rebuilding our own country.",
            "Could I inquire about the reasoning behind the prevention?\n\nAh, I believe it was due to someone's online discovery.\n\nOf course, I see\nNo, I don't believe it constitutes a breach of privacy.\n\nOn platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. While you may need to be friends with users to view their profiles, you've essentially granted them permission. Thus, sharing information on the internet implies consent to its visibility.\n\nHowever, it's a challenging situation. While it's impractical for someone to monitor all students' profiles, targeted surveillance could seem discriminatory. Yet, it depends on the context. If the profile was flagged for potential threat or if someone was merely browsing and stumbled upon something concerning, it's understandable.\n\nI myself don't have a Myspace account, but I do use Facebook. I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are individuals who can access personal details about me. I've witnessed a TV program about a man who easily obtained a girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. While I would never meet someone under such circumstances, I've had classmates contact me via instant messenger, knowing my identity despite my limited sharing. They could gather information about my interests, appearance, schedule, and even my friends' details.\n\nI try to limit my posts, but I use it to communicate with friends, so I balance privacy with connectivity. I only accept requests from known individuals, but the uncertainty of unknown viewers remains.\n\nMy roommate shared her high school's experience where students were prohibited from using Myspace. I found this unusual; I'm uncertain of the school's authority to regulate students' online activities.\n\nThis is the only other thought that comes to mind.",

            "The situation seems to be that instead of fully legalizing it, they've opted to decriminalize it. This shift downgrades the infraction from a criminal offense to a minor one, akin to receiving a parking ticket rather than facing imprisonment. Should one be caught and cited, the repercussions, like those resulting from a drug charge, become less severe for job interviews and similar contexts. However, it's important to note that the future ramifications of such charges don't entirely vanish with decriminalization.\n\nMoreover, the cost of arresting, housing, and processing individuals is considerable. Municipalities facing financial strain may not be eager to bear these expenses, even if decriminalization could alleviate financial pressure. In a city like Denver, where the populace tends to lean towards more lenient views, the municipality benefits from reduced costs which can then be reallocated to public education, social programs for the elderly, or food programs for the homeless.\n\nWhile marijuana isn't something that should be widely available, the financial implications are significant. It's not just a matter of legalization affecting everyone equally. Some may continue to view it as taboo, making it less socially acceptable to have it openly available. On the other hand, the effects of substances like alcohol and marijuana can vary greatly from person to person. The impact on motor skills and lifestyle can differ based on individual reactions. Consequently, it's challenging to generalize the effects of such substances, but they certainly have their adverse impacts.",
            "I'd agree that\nA significant portion of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nFor instance, they've maintained these rituals over extended periods\nIt's commendable to anchor oneself in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to embrace adaptability\nMany Catholics believe in weekly church attendance\nWith a stringent adherence to ritualistic norms\nSometimes, this can feel exclusive and unyielding\nIntroducing non-conforming individuals can challenge their doctrines\nFor example, my parents' differing religious backgrounds\nMy father was Episcopalian, my mother Catholic\nTheir union was not blessed within the Catholic Church\nThis approach seems contrary to their teachings of universal love\nBut the reality is, some practices appear antiquated yet persist\n\nI believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial\nBut I'm not convinced it would significantly mitigate issues of pedophilia\nGiven that such actions transcend marital status\nIt's likely such behavior would occur regardless of marital status\nThus, I don’t believe priests’ marital status would be a decisive factor in preventing such incidents",
            "I've yet to formulate a definitive stance on this matter. Both sides have compelling arguments, making it a complex issue. The crux of the debate lies in the delicate balance between church and state, and how to define marriage without causing offense. I believe that, given its nature, marriage should be recognized as a civil union by the government, just as it would for those who have been baptized. This approach avoids the complications of religious undertones and allows for uniform treatment. As for the federalization of marriage laws, it seems logical that all states would need to reach a consensus before such a measure is adopted. However, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. It's not a significant enough cause to warrant such a fundamental change to our constitution. It's simply not critical enough to amend the constitution for this purpose.",
            "I come from a home steeped in religious traditions, so the topic of homosexuality can be somewhat complex for me. I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ+, and while I may not fully align with their lifestyle, I do believe it should be legally recognized. I don't see this as a national issue that should be decided by the federal government. I think each state should have the autonomy to make this decision based on its own values and beliefs.\n\nMany states have diverse political leanings, with some being predominantly democratic and others republican. In a democratic state, it's understandable that there might be a push for LGBTQ+ rights. If you live in a state that chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it's only fair to respect that decision, as you've chosen to reside in that state. It's not about disagreeing with the state's decision but rather acknowledging the autonomy of the community that lives there.\n\nI strongly disagree with the notion that a president, particularly one who may not represent the views of all states, should impose his opinions on the entire nation, especially in matters as personal and diverse as this one. Bush's ban on same-sex marriage, for instance, doesn't align with my beliefs. I believe each state should have the power to decide what's best for its citizens, not a president who will soon be out of office. It would be unfair to leave such a significant decision to a federal power, given that the consequences will directly affect the citizens of that state, not the president himself.\n\nI hold the strong conviction that this matter should be left to the discretion of each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Well, I suppose I should address this point, as it's a significant issue. To begin, it's widely recognized that social media platforms, such as Myspace, are public forums. The very essence of these platforms is to enable individuals to share information with a broader audience, often the public. Hence, it's not an unreasonable expectation from the perspective of the school officials that they might come across such public postings on the internet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of school officials discovering potentially sensitive information, it's important to highlight the ethical balance between privacy and safety. On the one hand, students have a right to express themselves and share their thoughts publicly, as long as they're not violating any rules or laws. On the other hand, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its students, which may extend to monitoring online activities that could pose a threat to the school's security.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the intent behind the monitoring. If the school officials are merely snooping to catch students in potentially harmful activities, such as underage drinking or drug use, then it can indeed be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if their actions are driven by a genuine concern for student safety and to prevent tragedies like school shootings, then it becomes more about maintaining a secure learning environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the ethical line here is drawn when the school's actions align with the broader goal of making the school a safer place for all students. For instance, if the school officials have evidence or leads indicating that students might be at risk of harming themselves or others, their intervention would be justifiable. Conversely, if their actions are solely motivated by the desire to discipline students, it might cross the line into an invasion of privacy.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to understand that the internet is a vast and unforgiving virtual space. Once information is posted, it often stays there, making it difficult to erase or control. Therefore, students should always be cautious about what they share online, as it could potentially come back to haunt them later. This is a pertinent lesson I've learned from my experiences in public schools. We were often reminded about the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment, especially in the wake of tragic events like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that students have a right to privacy, I also believe that the school officials' actions should be guided by a genuine concern for the students' safety. The ultimate goal should be to create a learning environment that is both safe and nurturing, where students feel empowered to express themselves while being protected from potential harm.",
            "In retrospect, the initial sentiment was clear. The September 11th catastrophe was deeply personal. A part of me, caught up in the aftermath, yearned for retaliation. The idea of inflicting similar chaos abroad seemed like a just response. However, hindsight reveals that we may have acted on impulse rather than reason. The decision to intervene was driven by raw emotion, and I believe we underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nOur approach was hasty, lacking a coherent strategy. We entered the conflict unarmed with a comprehensive plan, assuming that our presence would engender order. Regrettably, the opposite occurred. The conflict grew, and our intervention proved ineffective.\n\nThe people we encountered were not merely adversaries but a people entrenched in their own strife. Their internal conflicts clouded their ability to engage with us meaningfully. Moreover, our presence exacerbated their divisions rather than uniting them against a common threat. It became evident that our intervention was not fostering unity but exacerbating divisions.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for military action was misplaced. We were driven by revenge rather than a clear mission. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq, in the heat of the moment, was understandable. Yet, I now question the wisdom of our actions. We failed to formulate a coherent plan for stabilization, and our presence only prolonged the chaos.\n\nThe war in Iraq did not yield the desired results. Our impact was minimal, and the country remains unstable. The notion of bringing democracy to a war-torn region was noble, but our execution was flawed. Our presence only prolonged the conflict and failed to achieve lasting change.\n\nI contend that we are not the agents capable of transforming these people. They must find their own solutions. Our continued presence in Iraq is futile. It is a drain on resources and a distraction from our domestic priorities.\n\nOur involvement has been lengthy, and our progress has been incremental. The situation has not improved significantly, and our continued presence only delays the inevitable. Ultimately, we must recognize that we cannot remain indefinitely. Our presence in Iraq is no longer serving a purpose."
