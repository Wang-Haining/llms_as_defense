            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in my opinion, could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. It's been noted that the Church's following is declining, and I believe this may be due to its sometimes rigid views on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. These views, while deeply rooted in tradition, might seem outdated to some. By adopting a more contemporary perspective, the Church could potentially retain and even attract more followers. The Church's stance on these matters has led some to question and even dissent from its teachings, with many feeling that the Church holds views that differ from their own. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might struggle to align with a Church that strongly opposes these practices. While I don't believe that allowing female priests or married clergy would necessarily address this issue, I do question why these changes haven't been considered. The Church's current practice of celibacy for priests, which is seen as a devotion to God, seems at odds with the concept of a balanced life that includes both work and family. It's an open question whether the Church's traditional views might be more flexible, and I'm not convinced that these proposed changes would have significantly altered the situation.",
            "Certainly, I should preface this by saying that my views on this matter are rather straightforward. I harbor no reservations about same-sex matrimony. I maintain that one's sexual orientation is not something that is chosen. It is innate, something with which one is born. I believe that individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation, as it is not a conscious decision. It's unfair to assert that a union between two individuals of the same sex is inferior to a union between a man and woman. I have not extensively delved into this topic, but I would strongly argue that it is wrong to make such a claim.\n\nI assert that sexual orientation is not a choice. It is analogous to one being born with certain physical traits. I was born heterosexual, and others may be born gay. This is not a conscious choice, and it seems unjust to hold such individuals responsible for their orientation. I firmly believe that the federal government should not intervene in this matter. It is not a legal or moral issue that concerns our nation's security. It is a personal aspect of one's identity, and the government should not meddle in such private matters. It is not their prerogative to judge or penalize individuals based on their sexual orientation. This is simply who they are, and they should not be punished for it.\n\nUltimately, it is not a matter for the federal government to address. It is a personal decision, and the government should respect that. I do not believe they have the right to interfere or impose their views on others. Let us allow individuals the freedom to live their lives as they see fit without government intrusion.",
            "It is my firm conviction that the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only justifiable but also imperative. The impetus for this belief lies in the absence of substantial arguments against it. Many individuals view homosexual couples as a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this perspective is oversimplified and misguided. Same-sex relationships are inherently different and multifaceted, much like the two sides of a coin—heads and tails, each distinct yet complementary.\n\nMoreover, numerous civil rights, such as property tax benefits and health care provisions, are contingent upon the legal recognition of these relationships. For instance, in the absence of legal recognition, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to visit a hospital room or make crucial medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This is illogical and unfair, especially when considering the lifetime commitment and shared responsibilities inherent in these relationships.\n\nExtensive scientific research has demonstrated that same-sex couples exhibit the same success rates and satisfactions in relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. The crux of the matter is that these couples are seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, rather than a religious ceremony. The separation of church and state should preclude any objection based on religious grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should play a pivotal role in this debate. The antiquated amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage should be repealed in favor of a more inclusive policy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that President Bush's views on this issue are deeply influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. While I am not deeply engaged in political discourse, it appears that these views are largely rooted in moral considerations, which are inherently subjective and vary among individuals.\n\nIt is concerning that many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological trauma or a personality defect, as posited by some religious communities. This notion has been debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association, which has issued statements refuting these claims. It is crucial for society to rely on empirical evidence rather than popular opinions or cultural norms that perpetuate misconceptions and prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a recognition of the fundamental human desire for equality and dignified partnerships. The federal government should lead the way in ensuring that these rights are uniformly protected in every state, fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
            "In my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a peculiar dichotomy. While certain drugs, deemed illicit, possess inherent benefits, their availability to the public can be a contentious issue. However, for medicinal purposes, I contend their usage should be considered. For instance, substances like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets are controlled substances, yet they're often utilized due to their therapeutic benefits. Denying these benefits merely because of societal stigma is counterintuitive. I advocate for a gradual integration of marijuana into the legal framework, rather than a wholesale legalization, to mitigate potential abuse. The negative perception of marijuana, as an illegal drug, hinders its responsible utilization. I believe, by addressing this stigma, people can adopt a more nuanced understanding, potentially allowing for its medicinal use.",
            "Personally, I believe the church has evolved to meet the demands of the 21st century. The atmosphere is less stringent compared to the past. When I was young, Sundays at church were a routine, complete with cute dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. Back then, everyone was dressed up, including my friends from private school who joined me on weekends. Now, however, things have changed significantly. There's a youth service that's only thirty minutes, and attire is much more casual, especially during the summer with beach clothes being common. Families often arrive late, and even morning masses have seen a relaxation in dress code. Jeans and khakis are now acceptable, though khakis have their own charm. The church I'm familiar with is focused on this adaptation, but I'm unsure about the church's political or theological intricacies.\n\nRegarding allegations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't believe changes like female ordination or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and who are attracted to children aren't necessarily cured by marriage. The inclination seems to be rooted in genetics, not upbringing. While the church might have been aware and tried to cover it up in some cases, I think the primary factor is the individual's nature, which is unlikely to change through marriage.\n\nI don't have any further thoughts on the Catholic Church",
            "In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the initial reception of the Iraq War's rationale was accepting, yet the passage of time has shed light on the deeper motives and missteps. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and the assertion of weapons of mass destruction proved to be baseless, heightening my skepticism. The administration's dishonesty and disregard for the Constitution are evident, as former Secretary of State Colin Powell now admits to not being convinced by the presented evidence. This, to me, constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, the younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and the ulterior motive of expanding energy supply, are clear. Despite the lengthy duration of the conflict, I believe immediate withdrawal could lead to a civil war and increased casualties. The proposed coalition of Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order seems inadequate, as it could exacerbate the sovereignty issue and further complicate the political landscape. The interim government's ineffectiveness, with Prime Minister's waning control and radical elements vying for power, highlights the dire state of the political process.",
            "I've been struggling with the premise of the question. Let's begin by acknowledging that the conflict in Iraq is a complex issue. I must admit, I don't have a deep understanding of the specifics; it's not a topic I frequently engage with. At its core though, I believe the Iraq War was initiated based on the premise that Iraq was behind the September 11 attacks. However, I'm unconvinced that this initial reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as Iraq was never properly deemed a state of war by Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq, not because of any moral or ethical stance, but because I think it's a waste of resources and a futile effort to impose our political system on another country. I do not believe in the claim that the U.S. should be in the business of creating democracies abroad, especially when it results in our military being tied up in a region that's been plagued by conflict for decades. Furthermore, I believe that our continued presence in Iraq is merely to secure access to oil, which is a shortsighted and selfish goal. I'm not sure how to feel about the war ending or continuing; it's a complex situation. On one hand, I understand the desire to protect our troops and support them through their service. On the other hand, I can't ignore the fact that our presence is exacerbating the conflict and causing more harm than good. I don't have a clear solution, but I do believe that it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the region.",
            "The notion of legalizing or declaring it as legal by the state seems misguided, in my opinion. The constitution's principle of separation of church and state is quite explicit. I believe the decision should rest with the churches, not the government. Attempting to exert control over this matter would disregard the constitution's clear guidelines. It's akin to favoring one church's beliefs over others, as seen with the predominantly Catholic and Christian stance against it. The federal government should not interject, as this is more about personal religious views than a matter of public policy. Proposing an amendment solely based on personal beliefs would be contradictory to the constitution and potentially restrictive. The economy and society could even benefit from its legalization, though the specifics are unclear. I've expressed my viewpoint.",
            "The conflict in Iraq, it's a complex issue, and I believe there are aspects of it that the administration didn't fully disclose to the American public prior to the invasion. The invasion, which began in 2003, was portrayed as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, yet the connection between the two events was tenuous at best. The government exploited the public's emotional response to the attacks to garner support for the war. Personally, I am opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, mirrors the Vietnam War. The government's focus on removing the Iraqi government and installing a democratic regime seems to be a replay of their strategy in Vietnam. The aftermath of such actions is often chaotic and unpredictable, and the U.S. government did not adequately plan for it. The U.S. has now been involved in Iraq for nearly three years, with numerous American lives lost, and the country is still grappling with instability. The transition to democracy is a lengthy process, and it's not as straightforward as the government made it seem. The U.S. should have been more prepared for the complexities of rebuilding a nation. The decision to invade Iraq was difficult, especially considering the high cost in American lives and the uncertain success of the mission. The issue of oil resources is a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy, and the search for weapons of mass destruction turned out to be unfounded. While I hope for a swift resolution, I don't foresee immediate peace in Iraq.",
            "I must confess, I'm an advocate for same-sex marriage. I have always held this belief and it's strengthened over time. I believe it's a deeply personal choice, not something that should be influenced by societal norms or political interference. It's been scientifically proven that sexual orientation can have biological roots, making it unfair to deny individuals rights they didn't choose.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand, in my own neighborhood, openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and are active members of the community. It's hardly something that requires government or political involvement.\n\nPresident Bush's attempt to define marriage according to his interpretation is, in my opinion, misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a personal choice, not a political one. It should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. The media's tendency to sensationalize same-sex marriages is a clear indication of this.\n\nI've read numerous studies and articles suggesting that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological predispositions, not solely by upbringing. If a person is predisposed to be homosexual, it's akin to any other inherent trait, no more controllable than the color of one's eyes. Yet, we see a double standard when it comes to same-sex marriage.\n\nI'm not sure I can express it any clearer. Same-sex marriage should be a private, personal decision, not a national or political one. It's a basic right to choose who you want to spend your life with, regardless of gender.",
            "In the contemporary landscape of digital communication, it's crucial to recognize that anything posted online is inherently public. When one shares content on the internet, it becomes accessible to an extensive audience, including those who might interpret it in ways unintended. As a Resident Advisor, I've encountered this firsthand; the impact of internet statements can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, discussing sensitive topics like violence or potential threats is not advisable, as it can attract unwanted attention from concerned parties. It's essential to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can shape perceptions and indeed influence actions. In the case of a past incident at my school, information about a threat was brought to the school's attention, leading to a thorough investigation. While privacy concerns are valid, if dangers are implied, it's imperative for authorities to take these concerns seriously. However, it's also essential to differentiate between genuine threats and playful remarks, as some individuals may use social media to share jokes or conduct experiments without cause for alarm. In conclusion, while it's vital to respect privacy, sharing sensitive information online can lead to unintended consequences, necessitating caution and responsible use of digital platforms.",
            "It seems the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the intent was commendable: to instill democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, I posit that our focus has shifted, and the original purpose has been diluted. It appears we may have become entangled in the endeavor for the sake of asserting our global supremacy, with considerations of personal interests potentially tainting the initial resolve.\n\nFurthermore, the protracted duration of the conflict is problematic. While the entrance into war was a clear assertion of our purpose, the sustained engagement suggests a deterioration of our original cause. It seems the war has become an end in itself, with an insistence on a decisive conclusion or victory clouding our judgment.\n\nI believe it is time to reevaluate our engagement. Continuing to pour resources into this conflict, while our own economy and social infrastructure languish, is unsustainable. We have ample domestic issues—poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—that demand our attention. It is high time we allow the local government to assume responsibility for its fate and redirect our allocation towards addressing our own pressing needs.",
            "Could you assist in clearing up a query regarding the circumstances that led to a specific prevention? On the internet, it seems that information is often accessible to a broad audience. For instance, on platforms such as Myspace, while certain profiles may require a member to view them, this implies a form of consent, as one would need to accept that person as a \"friend\" to access their profile. Posting information online essentially entails an understanding that a multitude of individuals may view it. The notion of someone intercepting and utilizing such data to prevent a life-threatening situation is intriguing. However, the practicality of having a single individual monitor all student profiles is impractical and could potentially lead to discriminatory practices. The situation could be complex, with profiles being accessed either randomly or intentionally for specific evidence. My own Facebook experience has taught me to be cautious about the personal data I share. It's a delicate balance between staying connected with friends and safeguarding my privacy. While I've accepted requests from those I know, it's unnerving to realize that strangers might have access to details about my daily routine and interests. My roommate shared that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace, which struck me as an odd restriction, as I'm unsure of how educational authorities could enforce such a policy. It's a nuanced issue with no clear-cut solution.",
            "In contemplation, I must address the Iraq War once more, a topic that I find myself hesitant to revisit. I was opposed to it initially, but its significance seems to have faded. The prevailing consensus, both domestically and abroad, regards it as a misguided venture. Polls from the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a staggering eighty percent belief that the invasion was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed there today suggest that withdrawal should commence within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been chaotic from the outset, with no clear path forward. The cultural chasm between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations is immense, and attempts to impose Western ideals are met with resistance. Saddam Hussein's regime may have been reprehensible, but the consequences of invasion far outweigh potential benefits. It is akin to walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nI struggle to find a compelling reason to prolong our involvement. The administration's justification for staying has yet to be substantiated. A phased withdrawal over a year or more might be plausible, but I question the urgency of an immediate departure. It appears that Iraqi citizens themselves, those we aim to help, desire our departure. Their counsel, if sought, could absolve us from responsibility if things deteriorate further. While we may never be viewed as benevolent in the Middle East, a swift exit would certainly alleviate our current predicament.",
            "Indeed, it is my conviction that gender discrimination remains a tangible issue in the United States. It is not merely confined to the female gender; rather, it extends across various professional domains. For instance, in industries where women are historically underrepresented, there exists a persistent bias. This is evidenced by the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women, though possessing the necessary qualifications, face barriers to advancement. This societal mindset, shaped by decades of tradition, often prevents women from reaching higher positions, despite their capabilities.\n\nMoreover, men also face discrimination in certain fields. For example, the fashion industry often regards male professionals with skepticism. This is due to the perception that men in fashion are not as well-versed in the female consumer perspective. Additionally, men who opt to stay at home to care for their children, despite their partners' higher earning potential, often encounter societal disapproval and scrutiny. Society frequently expects men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to a misconception that men not fulfilling this role are not contributing to their families.\n\nHowever, change is gradual. While women are increasingly occupying leadership roles and being accepted in the corporate world, these shifts have been slow. Similarly, the acceptance of men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, is also evolving. The fashion industry is beginning to recognize the value of male perspectives, particularly when informed by female relationships.\n\nDespite these improvements, discrimination based on both gender and regional backgrounds persists. For example, an individual from a rural background with excellent intelligence but subpar grammar may face skepticism in the workplace. This highlights the multifaceted nature of discrimination in the United States. While we have made significant strides since the 19th century, change remains a gradual process. It is essential to continue promoting diversity and inclusion incrementally, without forcing societal shifts too rapidly, to ensure sustainable progress.",
            "In my comprehension, the state has not legalized marijuana, but rather decriminalized it. This change in legal status means that possessing small amounts of marijuana is treated similarly to a traffic citation, rather than a criminal offense. This shift in policy aims to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it avoids the need for arrests, trials, and the appointment of public defenders. Consequently, it also reduces the financial strain on municipalities, allowing them to redirect resources towards more pressing needs, like education and social programs. However, it's important to note that while decriminalization can alleviate some of the societal burdens associated with marijuana use, it doesn't entirely eliminate potential future consequences, such as employment discrimination. Moreover, the widespread use of marijuana in public spaces remains a contentious issue, as it may be seen as inappropriate or unacceptable in certain contexts. Additionally, while both marijuana and alcohol can impair decision-making and motor skills, their effects vary greatly among individuals. Some people may be able to manage their use responsibly, while others may struggle with addiction or misuse. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana on a person's life depends on their personal characteristics and behavior.",
            "I must admit, the traditional practices within the Catholic Church, while rooted in history, can sometimes feel static and resistant to change. While it is commendable to maintain these long-standing customs, I believe it is equally essential to be adaptable and inclusive in our approach. Consider, for instance, the weekly church attendance expected of Catholics. This rigidity can sometimes seem exclusionary, particularly to those who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine. This strict adherence can extend to a lack of acceptance towards individuals from other faiths, such as my father, who was an Episcopalian, and his inability to wed my mother, a Catholic, within the Church. This stance, while traditional, can appear contradictory to the core teaching of loving others, regardless of their faith. I feel that the Church's practices often lag behind its principles, creating a disconnect between the two.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of priestly celibacy, while deeply ingrained, does not necessarily correlate with the prevalence of child molestation. Allowing priests to marry, I believe, would neither deter nor encourage such behavior. Pedophilia is a separate issue, unrelated to marital status. Thus, I do not see this as a viable solution to prevent such occurrences. In essence, the Church's refusal to adapt its practices to contemporary standards may sometimes hinder its ability to reach diverse communities, despite its well-intentioned teachings.",
            "I have yet to form a definitive opinion on this subject matter. Consequently, I find it challenging to assert that either side holds the correct perspective. However, I believe this issue to be particularly complex due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without causing offense to any group. I am uncertain whether civil unions should be recognized by the government, akin to how religious ceremonies like baptism are not. If individuals are married, I believe they should be viewed as having entered into a civil union, as that is the most accurate description of their relationship. I do not envision the government inquiring into the nature of their union or its religious basis. In regards to gay marriage, I see it simply as two people entering into a civil union. If all states could reach a consensus on this matter, it should be made a federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. The constitution should not be amended for such a significant cause, as it would be too divisive. It is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. Simply put, I do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage.",
            "Growing up in a household that adheres to Christian principles, my perspective on the topic of homosexuality is somewhat nuanced. I have several friends who identify as gay, and while I myself do not subscribe to their lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized. I believe this decision should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government.\n\nFor instance, many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, which means they tend to lean towards a particular political stance. If you choose to live in a state that leans Democratic, for example, you are likely aware of its stance on issues like gay marriage. I believe that individuals should respect the choice of their state rather than attempting to argue against it.\n\nMoreover, I think it is crucial that homosexuals be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. Therefore, I feel that the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. I firmly believe that President Bush does not have the mandate to impose his views on the entire country. Instead, I believe that the decision should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will ultimately be impacted by their own choice.\n\nIn two years, when Bush is no longer in office, a Democratic president may choose to lift the ban on gay marriage. This would simply lead to a political tug-of-war, with the decision constantly shifting. I believe it is far more practical to allow each state to make its own decision, as they are the ones who will truly live with the consequences.",
            "Um, I'd like to clarify a few points. Firstly, I don't believe in the notion that social media platforms like Myspace are inherently private. A bulletin board, by definition, is for public consumption. If one posts something on the internet, they must understand that it becomes publicly accessible, regardless of the platform. Consequently, school officials have a right to view this information, even if it's not under the school's name. They can access it from their personal devices, which they do at home. However, I see it differently when it comes to preventing school shootings. If accessing such information helps ensure student safety and safeguards the school environment, it's reasonable. This is the responsibility of the school system. Yet, I draw the line when officials actively use these platforms to catch students in misconduct. That, in my opinion, infringes on privacy. However, if the purpose is to enhance safety and security, it's acceptable. I've considered this with a teacher, and we discussed the need for such measures, especially after the Columbine incident. We practiced drills to maintain safety, similar to the school's role in preventing tragedies. Hence, I believe the officials were acting within their mandate to keep the school a safe haven for students.",
            "Initially, the events of September 11th deeply impacted me, fueling my desire for swift retribution. However, as time passed, I came to realize that our actions were rushed and ill-prepared. The emotional fervor that initially drove us to invade Iraq ultimately led to a complex situation that we were ill-equipped to handle. The lack of a clear plan and understanding of the cultural and political landscape proved detrimental. I now believe that our involvement has not only failed to achieve the desired results but has also exacerbated the situation. The inherent instability and factions within the region make it clear that our presence is not facilitating peace or progress. Instead, it keeps the focus on our presence rather than addressing the core issues. It is my firm belief that our intervention has been more harmful than helpful, and I advocate for a more strategic and nuanced approach. The complexities of the region and the nature of the conflict require a long-term strategy rather than a quick, emotional response.\n\nThe consequences of our actions are evident in the ongoing turmoil and lack of progress. The people of Iraq have their own battles to fight, and our presence does not seem to be aiding their self-determination. The initial impulse to act was understandable, but our actions have not been aligned with a rational, long-term vision. I now regret the lack of a cohesive plan and the emotional underpinnings of our initial response. The inherent divisions and chaos in the region suggest that our involvement has been counterproductive. It is crucial to reassess our strategy and consider the long-term implications of our actions. The people of Iraq need to find their own path to peace and stability, and our continued presence may be hindering that process. A more strategic and deliberate approach is necessary to address the underlying issues and facilitate genuine progress."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in my opinion, could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. It's been noted that the Church's following is declining, and I believe this may be due to its sometimes rigid views on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. These views, while deeply rooted in tradition, might seem outdated to some. By adopting a more contemporary perspective, the Church could potentially retain and even attract more followers. The Church's stance on these matters has led some to question and even dissent from its teachings, with many feeling that the Church holds views that differ from their own. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might struggle to align with a Church that strongly opposes these practices. While I don't believe that allowing female priests or married clergy would necessarily address this issue, I do question why these changes haven't been considered. The Church's current practice of celibacy for priests, which is seen as a devotion to God, seems at odds with the concept of a balanced life that includes both work and family. It's an open question whether the Church's traditional views might be more flexible, and I'm not convinced that these proposed changes would have significantly altered the situation.",
            "Certainly, I should preface this by saying that my views on this matter are rather straightforward. I harbor no reservations about same-sex matrimony. I maintain that one's sexual orientation is not something that is chosen. It is innate, something with which one is born. I believe that individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation, as it is not a conscious decision. It's unfair to assert that a union between two individuals of the same sex is inferior to a union between a man and woman. I have not extensively delved into this topic, but I would strongly argue that it is wrong to make such a claim.\n\nI assert that sexual orientation is not a choice. It is analogous to one being born with certain physical traits. I was born heterosexual, and others may be born gay. This is not a conscious choice, and it seems unjust to hold such individuals responsible for their orientation. I firmly believe that the federal government should not intervene in this matter. It is not a legal or moral issue that concerns our nation's security. It is a personal aspect of one's identity, and the government should not meddle in such private matters. It is not their prerogative to judge or penalize individuals based on their sexual orientation. This is simply who they are, and they should not be punished for it.\n\nUltimately, it is not a matter for the federal government to address. It is a personal decision, and the government should respect that. I do not believe they have the right to interfere or impose their views on others. Let us allow individuals the freedom to live their lives as they see fit without government intrusion.",
            "It is my firm conviction that the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only justifiable but also imperative. The impetus for this belief lies in the absence of substantial arguments against it. Many individuals view homosexual couples as a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this perspective is oversimplified and misguided. Same-sex relationships are inherently different and multifaceted, much like the two sides of a coin—heads and tails, each distinct yet complementary.\n\nMoreover, numerous civil rights, such as property tax benefits and health care provisions, are contingent upon the legal recognition of these relationships. For instance, in the absence of legal recognition, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to visit a hospital room or make crucial medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This is illogical and unfair, especially when considering the lifetime commitment and shared responsibilities inherent in these relationships.\n\nExtensive scientific research has demonstrated that same-sex couples exhibit the same success rates and satisfactions in relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. The crux of the matter is that these couples are seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, rather than a religious ceremony. The separation of church and state should preclude any objection based on religious grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should play a pivotal role in this debate. The antiquated amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage should be repealed in favor of a more inclusive policy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that President Bush's views on this issue are deeply influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. While I am not deeply engaged in political discourse, it appears that these views are largely rooted in moral considerations, which are inherently subjective and vary among individuals.\n\nIt is concerning that many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological trauma or a personality defect, as posited by some religious communities. This notion has been debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association, which has issued statements refuting these claims. It is crucial for society to rely on empirical evidence rather than popular opinions or cultural norms that perpetuate misconceptions and prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a recognition of the fundamental human desire for equality and dignified partnerships. The federal government should lead the way in ensuring that these rights are uniformly protected in every state, fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
            "In my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a peculiar dichotomy. While certain drugs, deemed illicit, possess inherent benefits, their availability to the public can be a contentious issue. However, for medicinal purposes, I contend their usage should be considered. For instance, substances like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets are controlled substances, yet they're often utilized due to their therapeutic benefits. Denying these benefits merely because of societal stigma is counterintuitive. I advocate for a gradual integration of marijuana into the legal framework, rather than a wholesale legalization, to mitigate potential abuse. The negative perception of marijuana, as an illegal drug, hinders its responsible utilization. I believe, by addressing this stigma, people can adopt a more nuanced understanding, potentially allowing for its medicinal use.",
            "Personally, I believe the church has evolved to meet the demands of the 21st century. The atmosphere is less stringent compared to the past. When I was young, Sundays at church were a routine, complete with cute dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. Back then, everyone was dressed up, including my friends from private school who joined me on weekends. Now, however, things have changed significantly. There's a youth service that's only thirty minutes, and attire is much more casual, especially during the summer with beach clothes being common. Families often arrive late, and even morning masses have seen a relaxation in dress code. Jeans and khakis are now acceptable, though khakis have their own charm. The church I'm familiar with is focused on this adaptation, but I'm unsure about the church's political or theological intricacies.\n\nRegarding allegations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't believe changes like female ordination or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and who are attracted to children aren't necessarily cured by marriage. The inclination seems to be rooted in genetics, not upbringing. While the church might have been aware and tried to cover it up in some cases, I think the primary factor is the individual's nature, which is unlikely to change through marriage.\n\nI don't have any further thoughts on the Catholic Church",
            "In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the initial reception of the Iraq War's rationale was accepting, yet the passage of time has shed light on the deeper motives and missteps. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and the assertion of weapons of mass destruction proved to be baseless, heightening my skepticism. The administration's dishonesty and disregard for the Constitution are evident, as former Secretary of State Colin Powell now admits to not being convinced by the presented evidence. This, to me, constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, the younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and the ulterior motive of expanding energy supply, are clear. Despite the lengthy duration of the conflict, I believe immediate withdrawal could lead to a civil war and increased casualties. The proposed coalition of Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order seems inadequate, as it could exacerbate the sovereignty issue and further complicate the political landscape. The interim government's ineffectiveness, with Prime Minister's waning control and radical elements vying for power, highlights the dire state of the political process.",
            "I've been struggling with the premise of the question. Let's begin by acknowledging that the conflict in Iraq is a complex issue. I must admit, I don't have a deep understanding of the specifics; it's not a topic I frequently engage with. At its core though, I believe the Iraq War was initiated based on the premise that Iraq was behind the September 11 attacks. However, I'm unconvinced that this initial reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as Iraq was never properly deemed a state of war by Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq, not because of any moral or ethical stance, but because I think it's a waste of resources and a futile effort to impose our political system on another country. I do not believe in the claim that the U.S. should be in the business of creating democracies abroad, especially when it results in our military being tied up in a region that's been plagued by conflict for decades. Furthermore, I believe that our continued presence in Iraq is merely to secure access to oil, which is a shortsighted and selfish goal. I'm not sure how to feel about the war ending or continuing; it's a complex situation. On one hand, I understand the desire to protect our troops and support them through their service. On the other hand, I can't ignore the fact that our presence is exacerbating the conflict and causing more harm than good. I don't have a clear solution, but I do believe that it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the region.",
            "The notion of legalizing or declaring it as legal by the state seems misguided, in my opinion. The constitution's principle of separation of church and state is quite explicit. I believe the decision should rest with the churches, not the government. Attempting to exert control over this matter would disregard the constitution's clear guidelines. It's akin to favoring one church's beliefs over others, as seen with the predominantly Catholic and Christian stance against it. The federal government should not interject, as this is more about personal religious views than a matter of public policy. Proposing an amendment solely based on personal beliefs would be contradictory to the constitution and potentially restrictive. The economy and society could even benefit from its legalization, though the specifics are unclear. I've expressed my viewpoint.",
            "The conflict in Iraq, it's a complex issue, and I believe there are aspects of it that the administration didn't fully disclose to the American public prior to the invasion. The invasion, which began in 2003, was portrayed as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, yet the connection between the two events was tenuous at best. The government exploited the public's emotional response to the attacks to garner support for the war. Personally, I am opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, mirrors the Vietnam War. The government's focus on removing the Iraqi government and installing a democratic regime seems to be a replay of their strategy in Vietnam. The aftermath of such actions is often chaotic and unpredictable, and the U.S. government did not adequately plan for it. The U.S. has now been involved in Iraq for nearly three years, with numerous American lives lost, and the country is still grappling with instability. The transition to democracy is a lengthy process, and it's not as straightforward as the government made it seem. The U.S. should have been more prepared for the complexities of rebuilding a nation. The decision to invade Iraq was difficult, especially considering the high cost in American lives and the uncertain success of the mission. The issue of oil resources is a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy, and the search for weapons of mass destruction turned out to be unfounded. While I hope for a swift resolution, I don't foresee immediate peace in Iraq.",
            "I must confess, I'm an advocate for same-sex marriage. I have always held this belief and it's strengthened over time. I believe it's a deeply personal choice, not something that should be influenced by societal norms or political interference. It's been scientifically proven that sexual orientation can have biological roots, making it unfair to deny individuals rights they didn't choose.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand, in my own neighborhood, openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and are active members of the community. It's hardly something that requires government or political involvement.\n\nPresident Bush's attempt to define marriage according to his interpretation is, in my opinion, misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a personal choice, not a political one. It should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. The media's tendency to sensationalize same-sex marriages is a clear indication of this.\n\nI've read numerous studies and articles suggesting that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological predispositions, not solely by upbringing. If a person is predisposed to be homosexual, it's akin to any other inherent trait, no more controllable than the color of one's eyes. Yet, we see a double standard when it comes to same-sex marriage.\n\nI'm not sure I can express it any clearer. Same-sex marriage should be a private, personal decision, not a national or political one. It's a basic right to choose who you want to spend your life with, regardless of gender.",
            "In the contemporary landscape of digital communication, it's crucial to recognize that anything posted online is inherently public. When one shares content on the internet, it becomes accessible to an extensive audience, including those who might interpret it in ways unintended. As a Resident Advisor, I've encountered this firsthand; the impact of internet statements can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, discussing sensitive topics like violence or potential threats is not advisable, as it can attract unwanted attention from concerned parties. It's essential to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can shape perceptions and indeed influence actions. In the case of a past incident at my school, information about a threat was brought to the school's attention, leading to a thorough investigation. While privacy concerns are valid, if dangers are implied, it's imperative for authorities to take these concerns seriously. However, it's also essential to differentiate between genuine threats and playful remarks, as some individuals may use social media to share jokes or conduct experiments without cause for alarm. In conclusion, while it's vital to respect privacy, sharing sensitive information online can lead to unintended consequences, necessitating caution and responsible use of digital platforms.",
            "It seems the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the intent was commendable: to instill democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, I posit that our focus has shifted, and the original purpose has been diluted. It appears we may have become entangled in the endeavor for the sake of asserting our global supremacy, with considerations of personal interests potentially tainting the initial resolve.\n\nFurthermore, the protracted duration of the conflict is problematic. While the entrance into war was a clear assertion of our purpose, the sustained engagement suggests a deterioration of our original cause. It seems the war has become an end in itself, with an insistence on a decisive conclusion or victory clouding our judgment.\n\nI believe it is time to reevaluate our engagement. Continuing to pour resources into this conflict, while our own economy and social infrastructure languish, is unsustainable. We have ample domestic issues—poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—that demand our attention. It is high time we allow the local government to assume responsibility for its fate and redirect our allocation towards addressing our own pressing needs.",
            "Could you assist in clearing up a query regarding the circumstances that led to a specific prevention? On the internet, it seems that information is often accessible to a broad audience. For instance, on platforms such as Myspace, while certain profiles may require a member to view them, this implies a form of consent, as one would need to accept that person as a \"friend\" to access their profile. Posting information online essentially entails an understanding that a multitude of individuals may view it. The notion of someone intercepting and utilizing such data to prevent a life-threatening situation is intriguing. However, the practicality of having a single individual monitor all student profiles is impractical and could potentially lead to discriminatory practices. The situation could be complex, with profiles being accessed either randomly or intentionally for specific evidence. My own Facebook experience has taught me to be cautious about the personal data I share. It's a delicate balance between staying connected with friends and safeguarding my privacy. While I've accepted requests from those I know, it's unnerving to realize that strangers might have access to details about my daily routine and interests. My roommate shared that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace, which struck me as an odd restriction, as I'm unsure of how educational authorities could enforce such a policy. It's a nuanced issue with no clear-cut solution.",
            "In contemplation, I must address the Iraq War once more, a topic that I find myself hesitant to revisit. I was opposed to it initially, but its significance seems to have faded. The prevailing consensus, both domestically and abroad, regards it as a misguided venture. Polls from the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a staggering eighty percent belief that the invasion was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed there today suggest that withdrawal should commence within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been chaotic from the outset, with no clear path forward. The cultural chasm between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations is immense, and attempts to impose Western ideals are met with resistance. Saddam Hussein's regime may have been reprehensible, but the consequences of invasion far outweigh potential benefits. It is akin to walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nI struggle to find a compelling reason to prolong our involvement. The administration's justification for staying has yet to be substantiated. A phased withdrawal over a year or more might be plausible, but I question the urgency of an immediate departure. It appears that Iraqi citizens themselves, those we aim to help, desire our departure. Their counsel, if sought, could absolve us from responsibility if things deteriorate further. While we may never be viewed as benevolent in the Middle East, a swift exit would certainly alleviate our current predicament.",
            "Indeed, it is my conviction that gender discrimination remains a tangible issue in the United States. It is not merely confined to the female gender; rather, it extends across various professional domains. For instance, in industries where women are historically underrepresented, there exists a persistent bias. This is evidenced by the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women, though possessing the necessary qualifications, face barriers to advancement. This societal mindset, shaped by decades of tradition, often prevents women from reaching higher positions, despite their capabilities.\n\nMoreover, men also face discrimination in certain fields. For example, the fashion industry often regards male professionals with skepticism. This is due to the perception that men in fashion are not as well-versed in the female consumer perspective. Additionally, men who opt to stay at home to care for their children, despite their partners' higher earning potential, often encounter societal disapproval and scrutiny. Society frequently expects men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to a misconception that men not fulfilling this role are not contributing to their families.\n\nHowever, change is gradual. While women are increasingly occupying leadership roles and being accepted in the corporate world, these shifts have been slow. Similarly, the acceptance of men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, is also evolving. The fashion industry is beginning to recognize the value of male perspectives, particularly when informed by female relationships.\n\nDespite these improvements, discrimination based on both gender and regional backgrounds persists. For example, an individual from a rural background with excellent intelligence but subpar grammar may face skepticism in the workplace. This highlights the multifaceted nature of discrimination in the United States. While we have made significant strides since the 19th century, change remains a gradual process. It is essential to continue promoting diversity and inclusion incrementally, without forcing societal shifts too rapidly, to ensure sustainable progress.",
            "In my comprehension, the state has not legalized marijuana, but rather decriminalized it. This change in legal status means that possessing small amounts of marijuana is treated similarly to a traffic citation, rather than a criminal offense. This shift in policy aims to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it avoids the need for arrests, trials, and the appointment of public defenders. Consequently, it also reduces the financial strain on municipalities, allowing them to redirect resources towards more pressing needs, like education and social programs. However, it's important to note that while decriminalization can alleviate some of the societal burdens associated with marijuana use, it doesn't entirely eliminate potential future consequences, such as employment discrimination. Moreover, the widespread use of marijuana in public spaces remains a contentious issue, as it may be seen as inappropriate or unacceptable in certain contexts. Additionally, while both marijuana and alcohol can impair decision-making and motor skills, their effects vary greatly among individuals. Some people may be able to manage their use responsibly, while others may struggle with addiction or misuse. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana on a person's life depends on their personal characteristics and behavior.",
            "I must admit, the traditional practices within the Catholic Church, while rooted in history, can sometimes feel static and resistant to change. While it is commendable to maintain these long-standing customs, I believe it is equally essential to be adaptable and inclusive in our approach. Consider, for instance, the weekly church attendance expected of Catholics. This rigidity can sometimes seem exclusionary, particularly to those who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine. This strict adherence can extend to a lack of acceptance towards individuals from other faiths, such as my father, who was an Episcopalian, and his inability to wed my mother, a Catholic, within the Church. This stance, while traditional, can appear contradictory to the core teaching of loving others, regardless of their faith. I feel that the Church's practices often lag behind its principles, creating a disconnect between the two.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of priestly celibacy, while deeply ingrained, does not necessarily correlate with the prevalence of child molestation. Allowing priests to marry, I believe, would neither deter nor encourage such behavior. Pedophilia is a separate issue, unrelated to marital status. Thus, I do not see this as a viable solution to prevent such occurrences. In essence, the Church's refusal to adapt its practices to contemporary standards may sometimes hinder its ability to reach diverse communities, despite its well-intentioned teachings.",
            "I have yet to form a definitive opinion on this subject matter. Consequently, I find it challenging to assert that either side holds the correct perspective. However, I believe this issue to be particularly complex due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without causing offense to any group. I am uncertain whether civil unions should be recognized by the government, akin to how religious ceremonies like baptism are not. If individuals are married, I believe they should be viewed as having entered into a civil union, as that is the most accurate description of their relationship. I do not envision the government inquiring into the nature of their union or its religious basis. In regards to gay marriage, I see it simply as two people entering into a civil union. If all states could reach a consensus on this matter, it should be made a federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. The constitution should not be amended for such a significant cause, as it would be too divisive. It is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. Simply put, I do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage.",
            "Growing up in a household that adheres to Christian principles, my perspective on the topic of homosexuality is somewhat nuanced. I have several friends who identify as gay, and while I myself do not subscribe to their lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized. I believe this decision should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government.\n\nFor instance, many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, which means they tend to lean towards a particular political stance. If you choose to live in a state that leans Democratic, for example, you are likely aware of its stance on issues like gay marriage. I believe that individuals should respect the choice of their state rather than attempting to argue against it.\n\nMoreover, I think it is crucial that homosexuals be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. Therefore, I feel that the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. I firmly believe that President Bush does not have the mandate to impose his views on the entire country. Instead, I believe that the decision should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will ultimately be impacted by their own choice.\n\nIn two years, when Bush is no longer in office, a Democratic president may choose to lift the ban on gay marriage. This would simply lead to a political tug-of-war, with the decision constantly shifting. I believe it is far more practical to allow each state to make its own decision, as they are the ones who will truly live with the consequences.",
            "Um, I'd like to clarify a few points. Firstly, I don't believe in the notion that social media platforms like Myspace are inherently private. A bulletin board, by definition, is for public consumption. If one posts something on the internet, they must understand that it becomes publicly accessible, regardless of the platform. Consequently, school officials have a right to view this information, even if it's not under the school's name. They can access it from their personal devices, which they do at home. However, I see it differently when it comes to preventing school shootings. If accessing such information helps ensure student safety and safeguards the school environment, it's reasonable. This is the responsibility of the school system. Yet, I draw the line when officials actively use these platforms to catch students in misconduct. That, in my opinion, infringes on privacy. However, if the purpose is to enhance safety and security, it's acceptable. I've considered this with a teacher, and we discussed the need for such measures, especially after the Columbine incident. We practiced drills to maintain safety, similar to the school's role in preventing tragedies. Hence, I believe the officials were acting within their mandate to keep the school a safe haven for students.",
            "Initially, the events of September 11th deeply impacted me, fueling my desire for swift retribution. However, as time passed, I came to realize that our actions were rushed and ill-prepared. The emotional fervor that initially drove us to invade Iraq ultimately led to a complex situation that we were ill-equipped to handle. The lack of a clear plan and understanding of the cultural and political landscape proved detrimental. I now believe that our involvement has not only failed to achieve the desired results but has also exacerbated the situation. The inherent instability and factions within the region make it clear that our presence is not facilitating peace or progress. Instead, it keeps the focus on our presence rather than addressing the core issues. It is my firm belief that our intervention has been more harmful than helpful, and I advocate for a more strategic and nuanced approach. The complexities of the region and the nature of the conflict require a long-term strategy rather than a quick, emotional response.\n\nThe consequences of our actions are evident in the ongoing turmoil and lack of progress. The people of Iraq have their own battles to fight, and our presence does not seem to be aiding their self-determination. The initial impulse to act was understandable, but our actions have not been aligned with a rational, long-term vision. I now regret the lack of a cohesive plan and the emotional underpinnings of our initial response. The inherent divisions and chaos in the region suggest that our involvement has been counterproductive. It is crucial to reassess our strategy and consider the long-term implications of our actions. The people of Iraq need to find their own path to peace and stability, and our continued presence may be hindering that process. A more strategic and deliberate approach is necessary to address the underlying issues and facilitate genuine progress."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in my opinion, could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. It's been noted that the Church's following is declining, and I believe this may be due to its sometimes rigid views on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. These views, while deeply rooted in tradition, might seem outdated to some. By adopting a more contemporary perspective, the Church could potentially retain and even attract more followers. The Church's stance on these matters has led some to question and even dissent from its teachings, with many feeling that the Church holds views that differ from their own. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might struggle to align with a Church that strongly opposes these practices. While I don't believe that allowing female priests or married clergy would necessarily address this issue, I do question why these changes haven't been considered. The Church's current practice of celibacy for priests, which is seen as a devotion to God, seems at odds with the concept of a balanced life that includes both work and family. It's an open question whether the Church's traditional views might be more flexible, and I'm not convinced that these proposed changes would have significantly altered the situation.",
            "Certainly, I should preface this by saying that my views on this matter are rather straightforward. I harbor no reservations about same-sex matrimony. I maintain that one's sexual orientation is not something that is chosen. It is innate, something with which one is born. I believe that individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation, as it is not a conscious decision. It's unfair to assert that a union between two individuals of the same sex is inferior to a union between a man and woman. I have not extensively delved into this topic, but I would strongly argue that it is wrong to make such a claim.\n\nI assert that sexual orientation is not a choice. It is analogous to one being born with certain physical traits. I was born heterosexual, and others may be born gay. This is not a conscious choice, and it seems unjust to hold such individuals responsible for their orientation. I firmly believe that the federal government should not intervene in this matter. It is not a legal or moral issue that concerns our nation's security. It is a personal aspect of one's identity, and the government should not meddle in such private matters. It is not their prerogative to judge or penalize individuals based on their sexual orientation. This is simply who they are, and they should not be punished for it.\n\nUltimately, it is not a matter for the federal government to address. It is a personal decision, and the government should respect that. I do not believe they have the right to interfere or impose their views on others. Let us allow individuals the freedom to live their lives as they see fit without government intrusion.",
            "It is my firm conviction that the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only justifiable but also imperative. The impetus for this belief lies in the absence of substantial arguments against it. Many individuals view homosexual couples as a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this perspective is oversimplified and misguided. Same-sex relationships are inherently different and multifaceted, much like the two sides of a coin—heads and tails, each distinct yet complementary.\n\nMoreover, numerous civil rights, such as property tax benefits and health care provisions, are contingent upon the legal recognition of these relationships. For instance, in the absence of legal recognition, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to visit a hospital room or make crucial medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This is illogical and unfair, especially when considering the lifetime commitment and shared responsibilities inherent in these relationships.\n\nExtensive scientific research has demonstrated that same-sex couples exhibit the same success rates and satisfactions in relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. The crux of the matter is that these couples are seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, rather than a religious ceremony. The separation of church and state should preclude any objection based on religious grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should play a pivotal role in this debate. The antiquated amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage should be repealed in favor of a more inclusive policy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that President Bush's views on this issue are deeply influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. While I am not deeply engaged in political discourse, it appears that these views are largely rooted in moral considerations, which are inherently subjective and vary among individuals.\n\nIt is concerning that many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological trauma or a personality defect, as posited by some religious communities. This notion has been debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association, which has issued statements refuting these claims. It is crucial for society to rely on empirical evidence rather than popular opinions or cultural norms that perpetuate misconceptions and prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a recognition of the fundamental human desire for equality and dignified partnerships. The federal government should lead the way in ensuring that these rights are uniformly protected in every state, fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
            "In my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a peculiar dichotomy. While certain drugs, deemed illicit, possess inherent benefits, their availability to the public can be a contentious issue. However, for medicinal purposes, I contend their usage should be considered. For instance, substances like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets are controlled substances, yet they're often utilized due to their therapeutic benefits. Denying these benefits merely because of societal stigma is counterintuitive. I advocate for a gradual integration of marijuana into the legal framework, rather than a wholesale legalization, to mitigate potential abuse. The negative perception of marijuana, as an illegal drug, hinders its responsible utilization. I believe, by addressing this stigma, people can adopt a more nuanced understanding, potentially allowing for its medicinal use.",
            "Personally, I believe the church has evolved to meet the demands of the 21st century. The atmosphere is less stringent compared to the past. When I was young, Sundays at church were a routine, complete with cute dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. Back then, everyone was dressed up, including my friends from private school who joined me on weekends. Now, however, things have changed significantly. There's a youth service that's only thirty minutes, and attire is much more casual, especially during the summer with beach clothes being common. Families often arrive late, and even morning masses have seen a relaxation in dress code. Jeans and khakis are now acceptable, though khakis have their own charm. The church I'm familiar with is focused on this adaptation, but I'm unsure about the church's political or theological intricacies.\n\nRegarding allegations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't believe changes like female ordination or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and who are attracted to children aren't necessarily cured by marriage. The inclination seems to be rooted in genetics, not upbringing. While the church might have been aware and tried to cover it up in some cases, I think the primary factor is the individual's nature, which is unlikely to change through marriage.\n\nI don't have any further thoughts on the Catholic Church",
            "In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the initial reception of the Iraq War's rationale was accepting, yet the passage of time has shed light on the deeper motives and missteps. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and the assertion of weapons of mass destruction proved to be baseless, heightening my skepticism. The administration's dishonesty and disregard for the Constitution are evident, as former Secretary of State Colin Powell now admits to not being convinced by the presented evidence. This, to me, constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, the younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and the ulterior motive of expanding energy supply, are clear. Despite the lengthy duration of the conflict, I believe immediate withdrawal could lead to a civil war and increased casualties. The proposed coalition of Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order seems inadequate, as it could exacerbate the sovereignty issue and further complicate the political landscape. The interim government's ineffectiveness, with Prime Minister's waning control and radical elements vying for power, highlights the dire state of the political process.",
            "I've been struggling with the premise of the question. Let's begin by acknowledging that the conflict in Iraq is a complex issue. I must admit, I don't have a deep understanding of the specifics; it's not a topic I frequently engage with. At its core though, I believe the Iraq War was initiated based on the premise that Iraq was behind the September 11 attacks. However, I'm unconvinced that this initial reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as Iraq was never properly deemed a state of war by Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq, not because of any moral or ethical stance, but because I think it's a waste of resources and a futile effort to impose our political system on another country. I do not believe in the claim that the U.S. should be in the business of creating democracies abroad, especially when it results in our military being tied up in a region that's been plagued by conflict for decades. Furthermore, I believe that our continued presence in Iraq is merely to secure access to oil, which is a shortsighted and selfish goal. I'm not sure how to feel about the war ending or continuing; it's a complex situation. On one hand, I understand the desire to protect our troops and support them through their service. On the other hand, I can't ignore the fact that our presence is exacerbating the conflict and causing more harm than good. I don't have a clear solution, but I do believe that it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the region.",
            "The notion of legalizing or declaring it as legal by the state seems misguided, in my opinion. The constitution's principle of separation of church and state is quite explicit. I believe the decision should rest with the churches, not the government. Attempting to exert control over this matter would disregard the constitution's clear guidelines. It's akin to favoring one church's beliefs over others, as seen with the predominantly Catholic and Christian stance against it. The federal government should not interject, as this is more about personal religious views than a matter of public policy. Proposing an amendment solely based on personal beliefs would be contradictory to the constitution and potentially restrictive. The economy and society could even benefit from its legalization, though the specifics are unclear. I've expressed my viewpoint.",
            "The conflict in Iraq, it's a complex issue, and I believe there are aspects of it that the administration didn't fully disclose to the American public prior to the invasion. The invasion, which began in 2003, was portrayed as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, yet the connection between the two events was tenuous at best. The government exploited the public's emotional response to the attacks to garner support for the war. Personally, I am opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, mirrors the Vietnam War. The government's focus on removing the Iraqi government and installing a democratic regime seems to be a replay of their strategy in Vietnam. The aftermath of such actions is often chaotic and unpredictable, and the U.S. government did not adequately plan for it. The U.S. has now been involved in Iraq for nearly three years, with numerous American lives lost, and the country is still grappling with instability. The transition to democracy is a lengthy process, and it's not as straightforward as the government made it seem. The U.S. should have been more prepared for the complexities of rebuilding a nation. The decision to invade Iraq was difficult, especially considering the high cost in American lives and the uncertain success of the mission. The issue of oil resources is a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy, and the search for weapons of mass destruction turned out to be unfounded. While I hope for a swift resolution, I don't foresee immediate peace in Iraq.",
            "I must confess, I'm an advocate for same-sex marriage. I have always held this belief and it's strengthened over time. I believe it's a deeply personal choice, not something that should be influenced by societal norms or political interference. It's been scientifically proven that sexual orientation can have biological roots, making it unfair to deny individuals rights they didn't choose.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand, in my own neighborhood, openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and are active members of the community. It's hardly something that requires government or political involvement.\n\nPresident Bush's attempt to define marriage according to his interpretation is, in my opinion, misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a personal choice, not a political one. It should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. The media's tendency to sensationalize same-sex marriages is a clear indication of this.\n\nI've read numerous studies and articles suggesting that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological predispositions, not solely by upbringing. If a person is predisposed to be homosexual, it's akin to any other inherent trait, no more controllable than the color of one's eyes. Yet, we see a double standard when it comes to same-sex marriage.\n\nI'm not sure I can express it any clearer. Same-sex marriage should be a private, personal decision, not a national or political one. It's a basic right to choose who you want to spend your life with, regardless of gender.",
            "In the contemporary landscape of digital communication, it's crucial to recognize that anything posted online is inherently public. When one shares content on the internet, it becomes accessible to an extensive audience, including those who might interpret it in ways unintended. As a Resident Advisor, I've encountered this firsthand; the impact of internet statements can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, discussing sensitive topics like violence or potential threats is not advisable, as it can attract unwanted attention from concerned parties. It's essential to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can shape perceptions and indeed influence actions. In the case of a past incident at my school, information about a threat was brought to the school's attention, leading to a thorough investigation. While privacy concerns are valid, if dangers are implied, it's imperative for authorities to take these concerns seriously. However, it's also essential to differentiate between genuine threats and playful remarks, as some individuals may use social media to share jokes or conduct experiments without cause for alarm. In conclusion, while it's vital to respect privacy, sharing sensitive information online can lead to unintended consequences, necessitating caution and responsible use of digital platforms.",
            "It seems the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the intent was commendable: to instill democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, I posit that our focus has shifted, and the original purpose has been diluted. It appears we may have become entangled in the endeavor for the sake of asserting our global supremacy, with considerations of personal interests potentially tainting the initial resolve.\n\nFurthermore, the protracted duration of the conflict is problematic. While the entrance into war was a clear assertion of our purpose, the sustained engagement suggests a deterioration of our original cause. It seems the war has become an end in itself, with an insistence on a decisive conclusion or victory clouding our judgment.\n\nI believe it is time to reevaluate our engagement. Continuing to pour resources into this conflict, while our own economy and social infrastructure languish, is unsustainable. We have ample domestic issues—poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—that demand our attention. It is high time we allow the local government to assume responsibility for its fate and redirect our allocation towards addressing our own pressing needs.",
            "Could you assist in clearing up a query regarding the circumstances that led to a specific prevention? On the internet, it seems that information is often accessible to a broad audience. For instance, on platforms such as Myspace, while certain profiles may require a member to view them, this implies a form of consent, as one would need to accept that person as a \"friend\" to access their profile. Posting information online essentially entails an understanding that a multitude of individuals may view it. The notion of someone intercepting and utilizing such data to prevent a life-threatening situation is intriguing. However, the practicality of having a single individual monitor all student profiles is impractical and could potentially lead to discriminatory practices. The situation could be complex, with profiles being accessed either randomly or intentionally for specific evidence. My own Facebook experience has taught me to be cautious about the personal data I share. It's a delicate balance between staying connected with friends and safeguarding my privacy. While I've accepted requests from those I know, it's unnerving to realize that strangers might have access to details about my daily routine and interests. My roommate shared that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace, which struck me as an odd restriction, as I'm unsure of how educational authorities could enforce such a policy. It's a nuanced issue with no clear-cut solution.",
            "In contemplation, I must address the Iraq War once more, a topic that I find myself hesitant to revisit. I was opposed to it initially, but its significance seems to have faded. The prevailing consensus, both domestically and abroad, regards it as a misguided venture. Polls from the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a staggering eighty percent belief that the invasion was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed there today suggest that withdrawal should commence within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been chaotic from the outset, with no clear path forward. The cultural chasm between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations is immense, and attempts to impose Western ideals are met with resistance. Saddam Hussein's regime may have been reprehensible, but the consequences of invasion far outweigh potential benefits. It is akin to walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nI struggle to find a compelling reason to prolong our involvement. The administration's justification for staying has yet to be substantiated. A phased withdrawal over a year or more might be plausible, but I question the urgency of an immediate departure. It appears that Iraqi citizens themselves, those we aim to help, desire our departure. Their counsel, if sought, could absolve us from responsibility if things deteriorate further. While we may never be viewed as benevolent in the Middle East, a swift exit would certainly alleviate our current predicament.",
            "Indeed, it is my conviction that gender discrimination remains a tangible issue in the United States. It is not merely confined to the female gender; rather, it extends across various professional domains. For instance, in industries where women are historically underrepresented, there exists a persistent bias. This is evidenced by the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women, though possessing the necessary qualifications, face barriers to advancement. This societal mindset, shaped by decades of tradition, often prevents women from reaching higher positions, despite their capabilities.\n\nMoreover, men also face discrimination in certain fields. For example, the fashion industry often regards male professionals with skepticism. This is due to the perception that men in fashion are not as well-versed in the female consumer perspective. Additionally, men who opt to stay at home to care for their children, despite their partners' higher earning potential, often encounter societal disapproval and scrutiny. Society frequently expects men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to a misconception that men not fulfilling this role are not contributing to their families.\n\nHowever, change is gradual. While women are increasingly occupying leadership roles and being accepted in the corporate world, these shifts have been slow. Similarly, the acceptance of men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, is also evolving. The fashion industry is beginning to recognize the value of male perspectives, particularly when informed by female relationships.\n\nDespite these improvements, discrimination based on both gender and regional backgrounds persists. For example, an individual from a rural background with excellent intelligence but subpar grammar may face skepticism in the workplace. This highlights the multifaceted nature of discrimination in the United States. While we have made significant strides since the 19th century, change remains a gradual process. It is essential to continue promoting diversity and inclusion incrementally, without forcing societal shifts too rapidly, to ensure sustainable progress.",
            "In my comprehension, the state has not legalized marijuana, but rather decriminalized it. This change in legal status means that possessing small amounts of marijuana is treated similarly to a traffic citation, rather than a criminal offense. This shift in policy aims to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it avoids the need for arrests, trials, and the appointment of public defenders. Consequently, it also reduces the financial strain on municipalities, allowing them to redirect resources towards more pressing needs, like education and social programs. However, it's important to note that while decriminalization can alleviate some of the societal burdens associated with marijuana use, it doesn't entirely eliminate potential future consequences, such as employment discrimination. Moreover, the widespread use of marijuana in public spaces remains a contentious issue, as it may be seen as inappropriate or unacceptable in certain contexts. Additionally, while both marijuana and alcohol can impair decision-making and motor skills, their effects vary greatly among individuals. Some people may be able to manage their use responsibly, while others may struggle with addiction or misuse. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana on a person's life depends on their personal characteristics and behavior.",
            "I must admit, the traditional practices within the Catholic Church, while rooted in history, can sometimes feel static and resistant to change. While it is commendable to maintain these long-standing customs, I believe it is equally essential to be adaptable and inclusive in our approach. Consider, for instance, the weekly church attendance expected of Catholics. This rigidity can sometimes seem exclusionary, particularly to those who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine. This strict adherence can extend to a lack of acceptance towards individuals from other faiths, such as my father, who was an Episcopalian, and his inability to wed my mother, a Catholic, within the Church. This stance, while traditional, can appear contradictory to the core teaching of loving others, regardless of their faith. I feel that the Church's practices often lag behind its principles, creating a disconnect between the two.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of priestly celibacy, while deeply ingrained, does not necessarily correlate with the prevalence of child molestation. Allowing priests to marry, I believe, would neither deter nor encourage such behavior. Pedophilia is a separate issue, unrelated to marital status. Thus, I do not see this as a viable solution to prevent such occurrences. In essence, the Church's refusal to adapt its practices to contemporary standards may sometimes hinder its ability to reach diverse communities, despite its well-intentioned teachings.",
            "I have yet to form a definitive opinion on this subject matter. Consequently, I find it challenging to assert that either side holds the correct perspective. However, I believe this issue to be particularly complex due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without causing offense to any group. I am uncertain whether civil unions should be recognized by the government, akin to how religious ceremonies like baptism are not. If individuals are married, I believe they should be viewed as having entered into a civil union, as that is the most accurate description of their relationship. I do not envision the government inquiring into the nature of their union or its religious basis. In regards to gay marriage, I see it simply as two people entering into a civil union. If all states could reach a consensus on this matter, it should be made a federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. The constitution should not be amended for such a significant cause, as it would be too divisive. It is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. Simply put, I do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage.",
            "Growing up in a household that adheres to Christian principles, my perspective on the topic of homosexuality is somewhat nuanced. I have several friends who identify as gay, and while I myself do not subscribe to their lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized. I believe this decision should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government.\n\nFor instance, many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, which means they tend to lean towards a particular political stance. If you choose to live in a state that leans Democratic, for example, you are likely aware of its stance on issues like gay marriage. I believe that individuals should respect the choice of their state rather than attempting to argue against it.\n\nMoreover, I think it is crucial that homosexuals be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. Therefore, I feel that the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. I firmly believe that President Bush does not have the mandate to impose his views on the entire country. Instead, I believe that the decision should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will ultimately be impacted by their own choice.\n\nIn two years, when Bush is no longer in office, a Democratic president may choose to lift the ban on gay marriage. This would simply lead to a political tug-of-war, with the decision constantly shifting. I believe it is far more practical to allow each state to make its own decision, as they are the ones who will truly live with the consequences.",
            "Um, I'd like to clarify a few points. Firstly, I don't believe in the notion that social media platforms like Myspace are inherently private. A bulletin board, by definition, is for public consumption. If one posts something on the internet, they must understand that it becomes publicly accessible, regardless of the platform. Consequently, school officials have a right to view this information, even if it's not under the school's name. They can access it from their personal devices, which they do at home. However, I see it differently when it comes to preventing school shootings. If accessing such information helps ensure student safety and safeguards the school environment, it's reasonable. This is the responsibility of the school system. Yet, I draw the line when officials actively use these platforms to catch students in misconduct. That, in my opinion, infringes on privacy. However, if the purpose is to enhance safety and security, it's acceptable. I've considered this with a teacher, and we discussed the need for such measures, especially after the Columbine incident. We practiced drills to maintain safety, similar to the school's role in preventing tragedies. Hence, I believe the officials were acting within their mandate to keep the school a safe haven for students.",
            "Initially, the events of September 11th deeply impacted me, fueling my desire for swift retribution. However, as time passed, I came to realize that our actions were rushed and ill-prepared. The emotional fervor that initially drove us to invade Iraq ultimately led to a complex situation that we were ill-equipped to handle. The lack of a clear plan and understanding of the cultural and political landscape proved detrimental. I now believe that our involvement has not only failed to achieve the desired results but has also exacerbated the situation. The inherent instability and factions within the region make it clear that our presence is not facilitating peace or progress. Instead, it keeps the focus on our presence rather than addressing the core issues. It is my firm belief that our intervention has been more harmful than helpful, and I advocate for a more strategic and nuanced approach. The complexities of the region and the nature of the conflict require a long-term strategy rather than a quick, emotional response.\n\nThe consequences of our actions are evident in the ongoing turmoil and lack of progress. The people of Iraq have their own battles to fight, and our presence does not seem to be aiding their self-determination. The initial impulse to act was understandable, but our actions have not been aligned with a rational, long-term vision. I now regret the lack of a cohesive plan and the emotional underpinnings of our initial response. The inherent divisions and chaos in the region suggest that our involvement has been counterproductive. It is crucial to reassess our strategy and consider the long-term implications of our actions. The people of Iraq need to find their own path to peace and stability, and our continued presence may be hindering that process. A more strategic and deliberate approach is necessary to address the underlying issues and facilitate genuine progress."
