            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It seems evident that the Catholic Church could benefit from some reconsideration in their stance on certain issues. Various interpretations have been made about the church's dwindling membership, and I believe it's due, in part, to their sometimes rigid views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While I respect their strongly held beliefs, I think their perspectives might be a tad antiquated in some respects. A slight adjustment towards more contemporary thought could potentially alleviate concerns over their decreasing following.\n\nIt's clear that many individuals are beginning to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these issues. For example, those who advocate for abortion or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable adhering to a faith that condemns these practices. Similarly, some might find it difficult to align with a church that opposes their personal beliefs in such areas. Notably, I do not see any intrinsic reason why female priests or married priests should not be permitted, although I am uncertain if these changes would have prevented past occurrences. Ultimately, these matters remain uncertain, and it's challenging to determine whether married or female priests would have made a difference in the past.\n\nMoreover, the idea that priests are devoted to God alone seems to overlook the reality of other people and responsibilities in their lives. Most individuals in the world have both a career and a family life, and it appears that priests should be no exception. The notion that priests are \"married to God\" does not preclude them from also having a family or a personal life.",
            "To be quite candid, I harbor no qualms about same-sex unions. I strongly believe that one's inclination towards a particular gender isn't a conscious choice. If one is born into this orientation, it's not something that should be held against them. It seems inequitable to permit heterosexual couples to marry while denying the same privilege to couples of the same sex. It's not something I've extensively pondered, but I'd assert it's unjust to make such a distinction. In my view, the federal government should refrain from meddling in this matter, as it's not a security or moral issue. It's simply about respecting individuals' identities and choices.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, as there aren't compelling reasons to the contrary. Many individuals contend that these unions undermine traditional, heterosexual families, but this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of relationships. It's akin to comparing two different sides of a coin; though distinct, they represent the same fundamental principle. Numerous civil rights are at stake, including property ownership and healthcare, where partners in same-sex relationships may not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. Furthermore, scientific research indicates that same-sex couples exhibit comparable success rates and satisfaction levels in their relationships. The crux of the matter is that homosexual couples are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, independent of religious ceremonies. Allowing civil unions but not marriage is analogous to segregation, as both forms of relationships share numerous similarities. Concerns about adoption and community impact are genuine, yet these issues are also present in heterosexual families. Children raised by same-sex parents often face judgment from peers and adults, a situation that can be mitigated through supportive environments and comprehensive education. I maintain that the federal government should federally legalize same-sex marriage, reversing the current amendment. However, President Bush's stance on this issue appears to be driven by religious beliefs, paralleling his positions on other moral issues like abortion and stem cell research. While I try to avoid politics, I believe that imposing religious morality on the government is inherently unethical and hypocritical, given recent controversies surrounding religious symbols and their place in public life. Additionally, the idea that homosexuals are psychologically damaged or traumatized is unfounded, as confirmed by the American Psychological Association. It's crucial to rely on research from credible institutions rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "During the summer months, I was employed in a hospital pharmacy. You see, merely because a substance is deemed illicit does not imply it possesses inherent benefits, especially when considering its availability to the public. While I do not advocate for its widespread accessibility, I am of the opinion that if used medicinally, it could be considered. Quite simply, being illegal does not equate to its lack of beneficial properties. In fact, many pharmacies utilize controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are acknowledged for their medicinal value.\n\nHowever, one must tread carefully when discussing such a topic. While I am not suggesting marijuana to be the same as alcohol, both can have negative consequences when abused. The key lies in gradual integration, rather than immediate legalization, to prevent misuse. The taboo surrounding marijuana must first be addressed to allow for responsible use.\n\nI believe the negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. It is not as harmful as other substances like heroin or cocaine. If we can shift the public's image of marijuana from a harmful, illicit drug to a more responsible perspective, it can be utilized for medicinal purposes. This, however, remains a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "Over the years, I've observed that the church has evolved to accommodate the modern world. The once rigid structure has loosened, and the atmosphere has become more relaxed. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with formal attire, including the cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses that were a part of our private school's dress code. However, as I've grown older, the church has adapted, introducing a shorter, more casual mass for teenagers, reducing the ceremony to just thirty minutes, and allowing more casual attire, especially during the summer. Families are often seen rushing in late, and beachwear is not uncommon. Even the morning masses, where formal attire was once the norm, now see a shift towards jeans and khakis. I have noticed this change most prominently, but the church's stance on other issues remains unclear to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and the issue of pedophilia, I believe that these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. I've seen married men who still have these issues, and I believe it stems from their genetics, not from their marital status. I think that individuals with these tendencies are often born with them, and they don't change due to marital status. The church, in this case, might not have been able to prevent these incidents, especially if they were trying to cover them up. I don't believe the church could have done much more to prevent these issues, as they are largely out of their control.",
            "** Initially, I was somewhat amenable to the idea, but upon reflection, I believe the collective trauma from the September 11th attacks led us to a hasty decision. The administration's rationale for the Iraq war was tenuous at best, with links to al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction now proven false. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding the Iraq war.\n\nMoreover, the Bush administration's lack of transparency and accountability in their claims is disturbing. Even General Colin Powell, who once championed the case, has since expressed doubting the evidence presented to the UN. Such willful ignorance of the facts strikes me as a flagrant disregard for the constitution and an impeachable offense.\n\nThere's a sense that the Bush administration entered office with an overwhelming desire for retribution against Iraq and a hidden agenda to secure energy resources, which is fundamentally underhanded. Nevertheless, a sudden withdrawal could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war and a higher death toll.\n\nThe alternative proposal—an international coalition involving Syria and Saudi Arabia—seems equally dubious. I'm concerned that long-term stability may be compromised due to ongoing sovereignty issues. The interim government appears ineffective, with the Prime Minister wielding little control and radical factions vying for power. The political landscape is fraught with tension, and the situation is far from resolved.\n\n**",

            "I must express my strong displeasure with the notion of legalizing this particular practice, let alone having a state endorse it. I firmly believe that the matter is best left in the hands of religious institutions, as the Constitution itself mandates a separation of church and state. This principle is explicitly outlined and should not be tampered with. Attempting to impose a legal stance on this issue would undoubtedly be a disregard of the established guidelines and a direct challenge to the Constitution.\n\nIn essence, I feel that those advocating for its illegality are essentially imposing their own religious beliefs onto others, particularly since the majority of Catholics and Christians are opposed to it. I maintain that the government should neither support nor denounce a religious practice. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our nation's constitution, promoting religious tolerance and freedom. Altering this fundamental principle with an amendment would be both incorrect and unprecedented.\n\nI firmly believe that the federal government should steer clear of this issue. The President's push for this amendment seems to stem from his personal religious convictions, which I consider to be a preference for Catholicism over other faiths. I argue that the amendment is not motivated by any substantial reasoning beyond personal beliefs, as its impact on the economy or society at large is minimal, and potentially even beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my assertion that this matter is best left to the discretion of religious institutions, not the government.",
            "The conflict in Iraq raises numerous concerns regarding the government's transparency with the public about the war's justification. Initially, I question the government's candor regarding the war's initiation, as it appeared to exploit the emotions stirred by the 9/11 attacks. The administration's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, despite their tenuous connection, exacerbated public sentiment against the government. The war's commencement in 2003 was a preemptive strike, and I strongly opposed such an approach. The Iraqi war, in many respects, echoed the Vietnam War, with the government not adequately anticipating the consequences of removing a country's government and establishing a new one.\n\nThe loss of American soldiers is profoundly sorrowful, and the repercussions of the invasion were not foreseen or prepared for by the government. The void of power and subsequent chaos that followed were not adequately addressed. The United States' intervention aimed to implant a democratic government, similar to its efforts in Vietnam, but this was also an ambitious endeavor that would not yield swift success. The government's lack of preparedness for the aftermath, and its initial optimism about a swift victory, were misguided. The war's duration and the ongoing risks to American troops demonstrate the government's underestimation of the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining a democratic regime.\n\nThe ethical dilemma persists, even as the war enters its fifth year. Should the United States remain committed to its intervention, given the potential risks and the ongoing operations to train Iraqi troops and police? The decision to invade Iraq raises questions about the government's motivations, particularly regarding oil resources. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the initial claims, and the contrasting inaction against North Korea, where such weapons are present, casts doubt on the government's rationale for the war. Ultimately, while I hope for a peaceful resolution in Iraq, the likelihood of a swift conclusion seems remote.",
            "I've always been a proponent of same-sex marriage. I believe it to be a matter of personal choice, and recent scientific research suggests that it may have biological underpinnings, rather than being solely the result of societal influences. I think it's inhumane to deny rights to individuals based on something they can't control. Historically, my community has included same-sex couples who've raised families alongside heterosexual ones. These families operate similarly, and it's absurd to suggest that their unions are any less valid or important. I'm against the government's involvement in this personal decision. I'm not convinced that the political climate should dictate who can and cannot marry. Marriage should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle.",
            "When I place something online, it's quite clear that it becomes accessible to the public sphere. It is entirely public. As an R.A., I have personally encountered issues stemming from this. When content is shared, it can significantly influence how others perceive you. If, for instance, you mention explosives or shootings, someone is bound to react. Such content should be refrained from being shared in the public domain. The internet, after all, is visible to everyone. If you're friends with an individual on social platforms like Myspace, you'll receive updates from them. It isn't the school that receives such notifications; rather, someone else does so and reports it. When such information reaches the school, they must address it promptly, as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic outcomes. However, distinguishing between playful banter and serious threats can be challenging. As our school once experienced, a seemingly humorous remark could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat. When shared online, privacy is essentially non-existent. If you wish to maintain privacy, refrain from sharing personal information. You cannot control others' perceptions or how they interpret your content. While I don't believe school officials should be monitoring students' social media, if the information is brought to their attention, there is no invasion of privacy. The school must handle potential dangers seriously, especially when they are reported. I, for example, avoid befriending residents on social media to prevent seeing personal content, such as images from parties, which could deter my ability to maintain a neutral position.",
            "The conflict seems to have persisted for much longer than necessary. Initially, the intention was commendable, aiming to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have since deviated from this noble goal. The extension of the war appears to be more about asserting our global supremacy than about the stated objective. I must also consider that personal animosities, potentially stemming from the previous administration's disputes with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to engage in this war.\n\nThe primary objective of installing a democratic government in a tyrannical state could be deemed justifiable. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict suggests a departure from this original purpose. It feels as though we are now engaged in a never-ending war, driven by a desire to achieve a decisive victory. This persistent involvement is not only emotionally taxing but also financially burdensome.\n\nThe endless expenditure on this war, draining our economy, is particularly concerning. Our nation faces substantial issues such as poverty and infrastructure development that desperately require funding. Instead, billions are being allocated to a conflict that has long since lost its justification.\n\nI believe it is high time we reassess our priorities and end this drawn-out conflict. The Iraqi government must now take responsibility for its own security and governance. Our resources should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic challenges. It is unjustifiable to continue funding a war that has lost its original impetus, especially when there are pressing needs at home.",
            "Could I just clarify something?\n\nWell, it seems someone accessed information online and discovered that certain individuals were engaged in questionable activities. Is that correct?\n\nOf course, the concern about privacy is valid. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, when you post information, it becomes available to a broad audience, even if it's only accessible to those who are friends with you. In a sense, you're granting them permission to view your profile. However, it's important to note that posting anything online means accepting that it might be seen by many.\n\nTo address the issue, it's challenging to have someone continuously monitor all students' profiles. Moreover, it could be seen as discriminatory if only certain students are targeted. But if the discovery was made during a specific investigation, it's understandable. The situation demands context.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I'm always cautious of people who might misuse the information I share. I've seen examples on TV where people can easily access personal details and manipulate others. I've had similar experiences in my classes - strangers knowing my interests, schedule, and friends. It's a delicate balance: I want to communicate with my friends but also protect my privacy.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that her high school had banned Myspace for students, which I found unusual. I'm unsure if that falls under privacy concerns or if the school had the authority to implement such a rule. It's a complex issue, and I'm not certain how to resolve it.",
            "To address the Iraq War, I must preface by noting that I feel an inherent conflict in discussing the topic, given the public sentiment I've personally witnessed. I hesitate to align with the chorus of initial dissent, as it's no longer a primary concern. Nevertheless, the general consensus, both domestic and international, has been overwhelmingly negative. A staggering seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including eight out of ten Iraqis and seven out of ten U.S. troops stationed there, believe the war was a mistake and advocate for our withdrawal within the next year.\n\nHistorically, the Iraq War has been a fiasco, both before and after our involvement. Withdrawing presents its own set of challenges, but staying indefinitely seems unwarranted. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is vast and deeply rooted. The idea that we can impose our democratic ideals on these nations is not only naïve but also disrespectful of their unique cultural identity.\n\nSaddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly tyrannical, but the benefits of deposing him must be weighed against the potential drawbacks of invasion. The situation post-invasion has been compared to quicksand, with Iraq descending into chaos and instability. I struggle to find a compelling reason to continue our presence there, given the overwhelming evidence that the Iraqis themselves want us to leave.\n\nThe administration may have hopeful reasons for prolonging our involvement, but they have yet to present a convincing case. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be an acceptable solution, but immediate withdrawal seems the most logical and compassionate course of action. After all, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, and a quarter wish for an immediate departure. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and their voices should be respected.\n\nIn the event of a withdrawal, if Iraq deteriorates, we can at least point to the Iraqis' decision as the catalyst, and if we decide to intervene later, our intentions would be more genuine. While we may never be seen as heroes in the Middle East, leaving now would be better than our current stance. Simply put, it's time to consider a complete exit strategy.",
            "Indeed, it's undeniable that gender discrimination persists in the United States, extending beyond merely gender and encompassing the specific domain of employment. This bias is not confined to just women; it also affects men and individuals in various other fields, such as fashion or parenting.\n\nIt's quite common, for instance, to encounter situations where a woman is qualified for a position but is not promoted due to historical biases against women in leadership roles. Similarly, a man might face prejudice if he chooses to stay at home to raise his children, as societal expectations often dictate that men are the primary financial providers. In the fashion industry, a man might be dismissed or doubted due to societal perceptions of gender roles and interests.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't confined to gender but also occurs due to one's background or area of origin. For example, someone who grew up on a farm might be overlooked for a high-level position despite their intelligence because of their grammar and accent. These biases highlight the need for continued efforts to address discrimination in all its forms.",
            "In my interpretation, the matter was not explicitly legalized, but rather decriminalized. This shift demoted it from a criminal infraction to a lesser offense, akin to receiving a traffic citation. When someone is apprehended for this, the resultant effects on job prospects and future endeavors, often the most severe they can be, are significantly mitigated. Indeed, while marijuana-related apprehensions may still carry some stigma, the financial burden on communities is considerable. The costs associated with prosecution, incarceration, and legal representation can be substantial. Therefore, many financially distressed communities may be reluctant to adopt such reforms. However, in more liberal environments, such as Denver, this approach can yield significant benefits, including increased funding for education, social programs, and support for vulnerable populations. While open drug use is not universally embraced, the financial implications of decriminalization cannot be ignored. I believe that the societal acceptance of marijuana is a multifaceted issue, and its impact on a community's finances is one critical aspect. Like many substances, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals able to exercise moderation while others may not. Therefore, I do not think it is possible to make generalized statements about the effects of marijuana.",
            "I would say indeed\nAs\nA good deal of their methods are quite conventional\nHaving persisted over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's commendable to remain steadfast in tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible in the face of change\nA notion\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly churchgoing\nAnd\nThey are quite stringent about adhering to their rituals\nSometimes\nI sense a certain disdain for those who do not strictly follow their beliefs\nAnd\nThey seem to reject those who are not perfectly aligned with their doctrine\nOr\nThose belonging to other faiths\nFor instance\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nI apologize\nMy mother was an Episcopalian\nMy father was a Catholic\nAnd they declined to marry them in the Catholic Church\nDue to my father's faith\n\nAnd\nThis isn't truly\nReflective of\nTolerance towards other religions\nWe were always taught to\nEssentially\nLove one another\nA core Catholic tenet\nYet\nIt's contradictory to preach love and simultaneously reject those who do not conform\n\nSo\nI believe many of the Catholic teachings advocate for certain actions\nBut the actual practice often falls short\nDue to its antiquated nature\nYet they persist in maintaining it\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily alter this\nI mean\nI personally believe priests should be allowed to marry\nBut\nI don't think it would essentially deter them from\nPedophilic tendencies\nAs it's a different realm\nIt might not make a difference\nBut I doubt it would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPedophiles may still act that way\nWhether they have a spouse or not\nBecause the nature of the act is different\nSo if they choose to engage in such behavior\nThey likely would, regardless of their marital status\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such acts\nI believe it would happen regardless",

            "I hail from a household steeped in Christian tradition, which has made the topic of homosexuality somewhat ambiguous for me. I have several homosexual friends, and while I may not fully comprehend or align with their lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be legalized. This issue, I contend, should not be a national concern, but rather a matter decided by individual states. After all, a multitude of states lean towards Democratic ideals, which would naturally support gay marriage, while others adhere to Republican values and may not. Thus, one should not dispute the decision of a state where they choose to reside, as it reflects their own ideological alignment. Consequently, the Federal government, including the President, should not impose their will on the matter. I maintain that each state should have the autonomy to decide, as they are the ones who will bear the consequences of their decision. This autonomy is all the more crucial given the brevity of the current president's term, which will soon be succeeded by a new administration with potentially differing views. It is, therefore, logical to cede this decision to the states, as they are the ones who will live with the ramifications of their choice.",

            "Initially, when the war began, I was quite enthusiastic due to the personal impact of the September 11th tragedy. I was driven by a desire to inflict similar chaos as was inflicted upon us. However, with hindsight, I believe we overlooked long-term consequences and entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan. The war ultimately backfired, and our involvement has proven ineffective. My perspective has shifted significantly since then. I now believe that our presence does not hinder the internal strife in the region. As long as they are occupied with their own conflicts, they do not pose a threat to us. My earlier infatuation with the idea of retaliation has subsided, and I now advocate for withdrawal. The war was initially driven by emotion and a desire for revenge, with little consideration for the potential ramifications. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was understandable, given the circumstances, but I contend that we could have adopted a more strategic approach. Our lack of clear objectives and unity only hindered our efforts. The people we sought to transform are, in my opinion, inherently resistant to change. Our prolonged involvement is futile, and the region's instability will persist regardless of our presence. It is in our best interest to disengage and focus on our own affairs."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It seems evident that the Catholic Church could benefit from some reconsideration in their stance on certain issues. Various interpretations have been made about the church's dwindling membership, and I believe it's due, in part, to their sometimes rigid views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While I respect their strongly held beliefs, I think their perspectives might be a tad antiquated in some respects. A slight adjustment towards more contemporary thought could potentially alleviate concerns over their decreasing following.\n\nIt's clear that many individuals are beginning to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these issues. For example, those who advocate for abortion or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable adhering to a faith that condemns these practices. Similarly, some might find it difficult to align with a church that opposes their personal beliefs in such areas. Notably, I do not see any intrinsic reason why female priests or married priests should not be permitted, although I am uncertain if these changes would have prevented past occurrences. Ultimately, these matters remain uncertain, and it's challenging to determine whether married or female priests would have made a difference in the past.\n\nMoreover, the idea that priests are devoted to God alone seems to overlook the reality of other people and responsibilities in their lives. Most individuals in the world have both a career and a family life, and it appears that priests should be no exception. The notion that priests are \"married to God\" does not preclude them from also having a family or a personal life.",
            "To be quite candid, I harbor no qualms about same-sex unions. I strongly believe that one's inclination towards a particular gender isn't a conscious choice. If one is born into this orientation, it's not something that should be held against them. It seems inequitable to permit heterosexual couples to marry while denying the same privilege to couples of the same sex. It's not something I've extensively pondered, but I'd assert it's unjust to make such a distinction. In my view, the federal government should refrain from meddling in this matter, as it's not a security or moral issue. It's simply about respecting individuals' identities and choices.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, as there aren't compelling reasons to the contrary. Many individuals contend that these unions undermine traditional, heterosexual families, but this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of relationships. It's akin to comparing two different sides of a coin; though distinct, they represent the same fundamental principle. Numerous civil rights are at stake, including property ownership and healthcare, where partners in same-sex relationships may not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. Furthermore, scientific research indicates that same-sex couples exhibit comparable success rates and satisfaction levels in their relationships. The crux of the matter is that homosexual couples are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, independent of religious ceremonies. Allowing civil unions but not marriage is analogous to segregation, as both forms of relationships share numerous similarities. Concerns about adoption and community impact are genuine, yet these issues are also present in heterosexual families. Children raised by same-sex parents often face judgment from peers and adults, a situation that can be mitigated through supportive environments and comprehensive education. I maintain that the federal government should federally legalize same-sex marriage, reversing the current amendment. However, President Bush's stance on this issue appears to be driven by religious beliefs, paralleling his positions on other moral issues like abortion and stem cell research. While I try to avoid politics, I believe that imposing religious morality on the government is inherently unethical and hypocritical, given recent controversies surrounding religious symbols and their place in public life. Additionally, the idea that homosexuals are psychologically damaged or traumatized is unfounded, as confirmed by the American Psychological Association. It's crucial to rely on research from credible institutions rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "During the summer months, I was employed in a hospital pharmacy. You see, merely because a substance is deemed illicit does not imply it possesses inherent benefits, especially when considering its availability to the public. While I do not advocate for its widespread accessibility, I am of the opinion that if used medicinally, it could be considered. Quite simply, being illegal does not equate to its lack of beneficial properties. In fact, many pharmacies utilize controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are acknowledged for their medicinal value.\n\nHowever, one must tread carefully when discussing such a topic. While I am not suggesting marijuana to be the same as alcohol, both can have negative consequences when abused. The key lies in gradual integration, rather than immediate legalization, to prevent misuse. The taboo surrounding marijuana must first be addressed to allow for responsible use.\n\nI believe the negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. It is not as harmful as other substances like heroin or cocaine. If we can shift the public's image of marijuana from a harmful, illicit drug to a more responsible perspective, it can be utilized for medicinal purposes. This, however, remains a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "Over the years, I've observed that the church has evolved to accommodate the modern world. The once rigid structure has loosened, and the atmosphere has become more relaxed. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with formal attire, including the cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses that were a part of our private school's dress code. However, as I've grown older, the church has adapted, introducing a shorter, more casual mass for teenagers, reducing the ceremony to just thirty minutes, and allowing more casual attire, especially during the summer. Families are often seen rushing in late, and beachwear is not uncommon. Even the morning masses, where formal attire was once the norm, now see a shift towards jeans and khakis. I have noticed this change most prominently, but the church's stance on other issues remains unclear to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and the issue of pedophilia, I believe that these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. I've seen married men who still have these issues, and I believe it stems from their genetics, not from their marital status. I think that individuals with these tendencies are often born with them, and they don't change due to marital status. The church, in this case, might not have been able to prevent these incidents, especially if they were trying to cover them up. I don't believe the church could have done much more to prevent these issues, as they are largely out of their control.",
            "** Initially, I was somewhat amenable to the idea, but upon reflection, I believe the collective trauma from the September 11th attacks led us to a hasty decision. The administration's rationale for the Iraq war was tenuous at best, with links to al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction now proven false. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding the Iraq war.\n\nMoreover, the Bush administration's lack of transparency and accountability in their claims is disturbing. Even General Colin Powell, who once championed the case, has since expressed doubting the evidence presented to the UN. Such willful ignorance of the facts strikes me as a flagrant disregard for the constitution and an impeachable offense.\n\nThere's a sense that the Bush administration entered office with an overwhelming desire for retribution against Iraq and a hidden agenda to secure energy resources, which is fundamentally underhanded. Nevertheless, a sudden withdrawal could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war and a higher death toll.\n\nThe alternative proposal—an international coalition involving Syria and Saudi Arabia—seems equally dubious. I'm concerned that long-term stability may be compromised due to ongoing sovereignty issues. The interim government appears ineffective, with the Prime Minister wielding little control and radical factions vying for power. The political landscape is fraught with tension, and the situation is far from resolved.\n\n**",

            "I must express my strong displeasure with the notion of legalizing this particular practice, let alone having a state endorse it. I firmly believe that the matter is best left in the hands of religious institutions, as the Constitution itself mandates a separation of church and state. This principle is explicitly outlined and should not be tampered with. Attempting to impose a legal stance on this issue would undoubtedly be a disregard of the established guidelines and a direct challenge to the Constitution.\n\nIn essence, I feel that those advocating for its illegality are essentially imposing their own religious beliefs onto others, particularly since the majority of Catholics and Christians are opposed to it. I maintain that the government should neither support nor denounce a religious practice. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our nation's constitution, promoting religious tolerance and freedom. Altering this fundamental principle with an amendment would be both incorrect and unprecedented.\n\nI firmly believe that the federal government should steer clear of this issue. The President's push for this amendment seems to stem from his personal religious convictions, which I consider to be a preference for Catholicism over other faiths. I argue that the amendment is not motivated by any substantial reasoning beyond personal beliefs, as its impact on the economy or society at large is minimal, and potentially even beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my assertion that this matter is best left to the discretion of religious institutions, not the government.",
            "The conflict in Iraq raises numerous concerns regarding the government's transparency with the public about the war's justification. Initially, I question the government's candor regarding the war's initiation, as it appeared to exploit the emotions stirred by the 9/11 attacks. The administration's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, despite their tenuous connection, exacerbated public sentiment against the government. The war's commencement in 2003 was a preemptive strike, and I strongly opposed such an approach. The Iraqi war, in many respects, echoed the Vietnam War, with the government not adequately anticipating the consequences of removing a country's government and establishing a new one.\n\nThe loss of American soldiers is profoundly sorrowful, and the repercussions of the invasion were not foreseen or prepared for by the government. The void of power and subsequent chaos that followed were not adequately addressed. The United States' intervention aimed to implant a democratic government, similar to its efforts in Vietnam, but this was also an ambitious endeavor that would not yield swift success. The government's lack of preparedness for the aftermath, and its initial optimism about a swift victory, were misguided. The war's duration and the ongoing risks to American troops demonstrate the government's underestimation of the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining a democratic regime.\n\nThe ethical dilemma persists, even as the war enters its fifth year. Should the United States remain committed to its intervention, given the potential risks and the ongoing operations to train Iraqi troops and police? The decision to invade Iraq raises questions about the government's motivations, particularly regarding oil resources. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the initial claims, and the contrasting inaction against North Korea, where such weapons are present, casts doubt on the government's rationale for the war. Ultimately, while I hope for a peaceful resolution in Iraq, the likelihood of a swift conclusion seems remote.",
            "I've always been a proponent of same-sex marriage. I believe it to be a matter of personal choice, and recent scientific research suggests that it may have biological underpinnings, rather than being solely the result of societal influences. I think it's inhumane to deny rights to individuals based on something they can't control. Historically, my community has included same-sex couples who've raised families alongside heterosexual ones. These families operate similarly, and it's absurd to suggest that their unions are any less valid or important. I'm against the government's involvement in this personal decision. I'm not convinced that the political climate should dictate who can and cannot marry. Marriage should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle.",
            "When I place something online, it's quite clear that it becomes accessible to the public sphere. It is entirely public. As an R.A., I have personally encountered issues stemming from this. When content is shared, it can significantly influence how others perceive you. If, for instance, you mention explosives or shootings, someone is bound to react. Such content should be refrained from being shared in the public domain. The internet, after all, is visible to everyone. If you're friends with an individual on social platforms like Myspace, you'll receive updates from them. It isn't the school that receives such notifications; rather, someone else does so and reports it. When such information reaches the school, they must address it promptly, as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic outcomes. However, distinguishing between playful banter and serious threats can be challenging. As our school once experienced, a seemingly humorous remark could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat. When shared online, privacy is essentially non-existent. If you wish to maintain privacy, refrain from sharing personal information. You cannot control others' perceptions or how they interpret your content. While I don't believe school officials should be monitoring students' social media, if the information is brought to their attention, there is no invasion of privacy. The school must handle potential dangers seriously, especially when they are reported. I, for example, avoid befriending residents on social media to prevent seeing personal content, such as images from parties, which could deter my ability to maintain a neutral position.",
            "The conflict seems to have persisted for much longer than necessary. Initially, the intention was commendable, aiming to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have since deviated from this noble goal. The extension of the war appears to be more about asserting our global supremacy than about the stated objective. I must also consider that personal animosities, potentially stemming from the previous administration's disputes with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to engage in this war.\n\nThe primary objective of installing a democratic government in a tyrannical state could be deemed justifiable. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict suggests a departure from this original purpose. It feels as though we are now engaged in a never-ending war, driven by a desire to achieve a decisive victory. This persistent involvement is not only emotionally taxing but also financially burdensome.\n\nThe endless expenditure on this war, draining our economy, is particularly concerning. Our nation faces substantial issues such as poverty and infrastructure development that desperately require funding. Instead, billions are being allocated to a conflict that has long since lost its justification.\n\nI believe it is high time we reassess our priorities and end this drawn-out conflict. The Iraqi government must now take responsibility for its own security and governance. Our resources should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic challenges. It is unjustifiable to continue funding a war that has lost its original impetus, especially when there are pressing needs at home.",
            "Could I just clarify something?\n\nWell, it seems someone accessed information online and discovered that certain individuals were engaged in questionable activities. Is that correct?\n\nOf course, the concern about privacy is valid. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, when you post information, it becomes available to a broad audience, even if it's only accessible to those who are friends with you. In a sense, you're granting them permission to view your profile. However, it's important to note that posting anything online means accepting that it might be seen by many.\n\nTo address the issue, it's challenging to have someone continuously monitor all students' profiles. Moreover, it could be seen as discriminatory if only certain students are targeted. But if the discovery was made during a specific investigation, it's understandable. The situation demands context.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I'm always cautious of people who might misuse the information I share. I've seen examples on TV where people can easily access personal details and manipulate others. I've had similar experiences in my classes - strangers knowing my interests, schedule, and friends. It's a delicate balance: I want to communicate with my friends but also protect my privacy.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that her high school had banned Myspace for students, which I found unusual. I'm unsure if that falls under privacy concerns or if the school had the authority to implement such a rule. It's a complex issue, and I'm not certain how to resolve it.",
            "To address the Iraq War, I must preface by noting that I feel an inherent conflict in discussing the topic, given the public sentiment I've personally witnessed. I hesitate to align with the chorus of initial dissent, as it's no longer a primary concern. Nevertheless, the general consensus, both domestic and international, has been overwhelmingly negative. A staggering seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including eight out of ten Iraqis and seven out of ten U.S. troops stationed there, believe the war was a mistake and advocate for our withdrawal within the next year.\n\nHistorically, the Iraq War has been a fiasco, both before and after our involvement. Withdrawing presents its own set of challenges, but staying indefinitely seems unwarranted. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is vast and deeply rooted. The idea that we can impose our democratic ideals on these nations is not only naïve but also disrespectful of their unique cultural identity.\n\nSaddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly tyrannical, but the benefits of deposing him must be weighed against the potential drawbacks of invasion. The situation post-invasion has been compared to quicksand, with Iraq descending into chaos and instability. I struggle to find a compelling reason to continue our presence there, given the overwhelming evidence that the Iraqis themselves want us to leave.\n\nThe administration may have hopeful reasons for prolonging our involvement, but they have yet to present a convincing case. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be an acceptable solution, but immediate withdrawal seems the most logical and compassionate course of action. After all, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, and a quarter wish for an immediate departure. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and their voices should be respected.\n\nIn the event of a withdrawal, if Iraq deteriorates, we can at least point to the Iraqis' decision as the catalyst, and if we decide to intervene later, our intentions would be more genuine. While we may never be seen as heroes in the Middle East, leaving now would be better than our current stance. Simply put, it's time to consider a complete exit strategy.",
            "Indeed, it's undeniable that gender discrimination persists in the United States, extending beyond merely gender and encompassing the specific domain of employment. This bias is not confined to just women; it also affects men and individuals in various other fields, such as fashion or parenting.\n\nIt's quite common, for instance, to encounter situations where a woman is qualified for a position but is not promoted due to historical biases against women in leadership roles. Similarly, a man might face prejudice if he chooses to stay at home to raise his children, as societal expectations often dictate that men are the primary financial providers. In the fashion industry, a man might be dismissed or doubted due to societal perceptions of gender roles and interests.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't confined to gender but also occurs due to one's background or area of origin. For example, someone who grew up on a farm might be overlooked for a high-level position despite their intelligence because of their grammar and accent. These biases highlight the need for continued efforts to address discrimination in all its forms.",
            "In my interpretation, the matter was not explicitly legalized, but rather decriminalized. This shift demoted it from a criminal infraction to a lesser offense, akin to receiving a traffic citation. When someone is apprehended for this, the resultant effects on job prospects and future endeavors, often the most severe they can be, are significantly mitigated. Indeed, while marijuana-related apprehensions may still carry some stigma, the financial burden on communities is considerable. The costs associated with prosecution, incarceration, and legal representation can be substantial. Therefore, many financially distressed communities may be reluctant to adopt such reforms. However, in more liberal environments, such as Denver, this approach can yield significant benefits, including increased funding for education, social programs, and support for vulnerable populations. While open drug use is not universally embraced, the financial implications of decriminalization cannot be ignored. I believe that the societal acceptance of marijuana is a multifaceted issue, and its impact on a community's finances is one critical aspect. Like many substances, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals able to exercise moderation while others may not. Therefore, I do not think it is possible to make generalized statements about the effects of marijuana.",
            "I would say indeed\nAs\nA good deal of their methods are quite conventional\nHaving persisted over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's commendable to remain steadfast in tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible in the face of change\nA notion\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly churchgoing\nAnd\nThey are quite stringent about adhering to their rituals\nSometimes\nI sense a certain disdain for those who do not strictly follow their beliefs\nAnd\nThey seem to reject those who are not perfectly aligned with their doctrine\nOr\nThose belonging to other faiths\nFor instance\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nI apologize\nMy mother was an Episcopalian\nMy father was a Catholic\nAnd they declined to marry them in the Catholic Church\nDue to my father's faith\n\nAnd\nThis isn't truly\nReflective of\nTolerance towards other religions\nWe were always taught to\nEssentially\nLove one another\nA core Catholic tenet\nYet\nIt's contradictory to preach love and simultaneously reject those who do not conform\n\nSo\nI believe many of the Catholic teachings advocate for certain actions\nBut the actual practice often falls short\nDue to its antiquated nature\nYet they persist in maintaining it\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily alter this\nI mean\nI personally believe priests should be allowed to marry\nBut\nI don't think it would essentially deter them from\nPedophilic tendencies\nAs it's a different realm\nIt might not make a difference\nBut I doubt it would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPedophiles may still act that way\nWhether they have a spouse or not\nBecause the nature of the act is different\nSo if they choose to engage in such behavior\nThey likely would, regardless of their marital status\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such acts\nI believe it would happen regardless",

            "I hail from a household steeped in Christian tradition, which has made the topic of homosexuality somewhat ambiguous for me. I have several homosexual friends, and while I may not fully comprehend or align with their lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be legalized. This issue, I contend, should not be a national concern, but rather a matter decided by individual states. After all, a multitude of states lean towards Democratic ideals, which would naturally support gay marriage, while others adhere to Republican values and may not. Thus, one should not dispute the decision of a state where they choose to reside, as it reflects their own ideological alignment. Consequently, the Federal government, including the President, should not impose their will on the matter. I maintain that each state should have the autonomy to decide, as they are the ones who will bear the consequences of their decision. This autonomy is all the more crucial given the brevity of the current president's term, which will soon be succeeded by a new administration with potentially differing views. It is, therefore, logical to cede this decision to the states, as they are the ones who will live with the ramifications of their choice.",

            "Initially, when the war began, I was quite enthusiastic due to the personal impact of the September 11th tragedy. I was driven by a desire to inflict similar chaos as was inflicted upon us. However, with hindsight, I believe we overlooked long-term consequences and entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan. The war ultimately backfired, and our involvement has proven ineffective. My perspective has shifted significantly since then. I now believe that our presence does not hinder the internal strife in the region. As long as they are occupied with their own conflicts, they do not pose a threat to us. My earlier infatuation with the idea of retaliation has subsided, and I now advocate for withdrawal. The war was initially driven by emotion and a desire for revenge, with little consideration for the potential ramifications. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was understandable, given the circumstances, but I contend that we could have adopted a more strategic approach. Our lack of clear objectives and unity only hindered our efforts. The people we sought to transform are, in my opinion, inherently resistant to change. Our prolonged involvement is futile, and the region's instability will persist regardless of our presence. It is in our best interest to disengage and focus on our own affairs."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It seems evident that the Catholic Church could benefit from some reconsideration in their stance on certain issues. Various interpretations have been made about the church's dwindling membership, and I believe it's due, in part, to their sometimes rigid views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While I respect their strongly held beliefs, I think their perspectives might be a tad antiquated in some respects. A slight adjustment towards more contemporary thought could potentially alleviate concerns over their decreasing following.\n\nIt's clear that many individuals are beginning to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these issues. For example, those who advocate for abortion or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable adhering to a faith that condemns these practices. Similarly, some might find it difficult to align with a church that opposes their personal beliefs in such areas. Notably, I do not see any intrinsic reason why female priests or married priests should not be permitted, although I am uncertain if these changes would have prevented past occurrences. Ultimately, these matters remain uncertain, and it's challenging to determine whether married or female priests would have made a difference in the past.\n\nMoreover, the idea that priests are devoted to God alone seems to overlook the reality of other people and responsibilities in their lives. Most individuals in the world have both a career and a family life, and it appears that priests should be no exception. The notion that priests are \"married to God\" does not preclude them from also having a family or a personal life.",
            "To be quite candid, I harbor no qualms about same-sex unions. I strongly believe that one's inclination towards a particular gender isn't a conscious choice. If one is born into this orientation, it's not something that should be held against them. It seems inequitable to permit heterosexual couples to marry while denying the same privilege to couples of the same sex. It's not something I've extensively pondered, but I'd assert it's unjust to make such a distinction. In my view, the federal government should refrain from meddling in this matter, as it's not a security or moral issue. It's simply about respecting individuals' identities and choices.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, as there aren't compelling reasons to the contrary. Many individuals contend that these unions undermine traditional, heterosexual families, but this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of relationships. It's akin to comparing two different sides of a coin; though distinct, they represent the same fundamental principle. Numerous civil rights are at stake, including property ownership and healthcare, where partners in same-sex relationships may not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. Furthermore, scientific research indicates that same-sex couples exhibit comparable success rates and satisfaction levels in their relationships. The crux of the matter is that homosexual couples are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, independent of religious ceremonies. Allowing civil unions but not marriage is analogous to segregation, as both forms of relationships share numerous similarities. Concerns about adoption and community impact are genuine, yet these issues are also present in heterosexual families. Children raised by same-sex parents often face judgment from peers and adults, a situation that can be mitigated through supportive environments and comprehensive education. I maintain that the federal government should federally legalize same-sex marriage, reversing the current amendment. However, President Bush's stance on this issue appears to be driven by religious beliefs, paralleling his positions on other moral issues like abortion and stem cell research. While I try to avoid politics, I believe that imposing religious morality on the government is inherently unethical and hypocritical, given recent controversies surrounding religious symbols and their place in public life. Additionally, the idea that homosexuals are psychologically damaged or traumatized is unfounded, as confirmed by the American Psychological Association. It's crucial to rely on research from credible institutions rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "During the summer months, I was employed in a hospital pharmacy. You see, merely because a substance is deemed illicit does not imply it possesses inherent benefits, especially when considering its availability to the public. While I do not advocate for its widespread accessibility, I am of the opinion that if used medicinally, it could be considered. Quite simply, being illegal does not equate to its lack of beneficial properties. In fact, many pharmacies utilize controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are acknowledged for their medicinal value.\n\nHowever, one must tread carefully when discussing such a topic. While I am not suggesting marijuana to be the same as alcohol, both can have negative consequences when abused. The key lies in gradual integration, rather than immediate legalization, to prevent misuse. The taboo surrounding marijuana must first be addressed to allow for responsible use.\n\nI believe the negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. It is not as harmful as other substances like heroin or cocaine. If we can shift the public's image of marijuana from a harmful, illicit drug to a more responsible perspective, it can be utilized for medicinal purposes. This, however, remains a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "Over the years, I've observed that the church has evolved to accommodate the modern world. The once rigid structure has loosened, and the atmosphere has become more relaxed. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with formal attire, including the cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses that were a part of our private school's dress code. However, as I've grown older, the church has adapted, introducing a shorter, more casual mass for teenagers, reducing the ceremony to just thirty minutes, and allowing more casual attire, especially during the summer. Families are often seen rushing in late, and beachwear is not uncommon. Even the morning masses, where formal attire was once the norm, now see a shift towards jeans and khakis. I have noticed this change most prominently, but the church's stance on other issues remains unclear to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and the issue of pedophilia, I believe that these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. I've seen married men who still have these issues, and I believe it stems from their genetics, not from their marital status. I think that individuals with these tendencies are often born with them, and they don't change due to marital status. The church, in this case, might not have been able to prevent these incidents, especially if they were trying to cover them up. I don't believe the church could have done much more to prevent these issues, as they are largely out of their control.",
            "** Initially, I was somewhat amenable to the idea, but upon reflection, I believe the collective trauma from the September 11th attacks led us to a hasty decision. The administration's rationale for the Iraq war was tenuous at best, with links to al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction now proven false. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding the Iraq war.\n\nMoreover, the Bush administration's lack of transparency and accountability in their claims is disturbing. Even General Colin Powell, who once championed the case, has since expressed doubting the evidence presented to the UN. Such willful ignorance of the facts strikes me as a flagrant disregard for the constitution and an impeachable offense.\n\nThere's a sense that the Bush administration entered office with an overwhelming desire for retribution against Iraq and a hidden agenda to secure energy resources, which is fundamentally underhanded. Nevertheless, a sudden withdrawal could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war and a higher death toll.\n\nThe alternative proposal—an international coalition involving Syria and Saudi Arabia—seems equally dubious. I'm concerned that long-term stability may be compromised due to ongoing sovereignty issues. The interim government appears ineffective, with the Prime Minister wielding little control and radical factions vying for power. The political landscape is fraught with tension, and the situation is far from resolved.\n\n**",

            "I must express my strong displeasure with the notion of legalizing this particular practice, let alone having a state endorse it. I firmly believe that the matter is best left in the hands of religious institutions, as the Constitution itself mandates a separation of church and state. This principle is explicitly outlined and should not be tampered with. Attempting to impose a legal stance on this issue would undoubtedly be a disregard of the established guidelines and a direct challenge to the Constitution.\n\nIn essence, I feel that those advocating for its illegality are essentially imposing their own religious beliefs onto others, particularly since the majority of Catholics and Christians are opposed to it. I maintain that the government should neither support nor denounce a religious practice. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our nation's constitution, promoting religious tolerance and freedom. Altering this fundamental principle with an amendment would be both incorrect and unprecedented.\n\nI firmly believe that the federal government should steer clear of this issue. The President's push for this amendment seems to stem from his personal religious convictions, which I consider to be a preference for Catholicism over other faiths. I argue that the amendment is not motivated by any substantial reasoning beyond personal beliefs, as its impact on the economy or society at large is minimal, and potentially even beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my assertion that this matter is best left to the discretion of religious institutions, not the government.",
            "The conflict in Iraq raises numerous concerns regarding the government's transparency with the public about the war's justification. Initially, I question the government's candor regarding the war's initiation, as it appeared to exploit the emotions stirred by the 9/11 attacks. The administration's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, despite their tenuous connection, exacerbated public sentiment against the government. The war's commencement in 2003 was a preemptive strike, and I strongly opposed such an approach. The Iraqi war, in many respects, echoed the Vietnam War, with the government not adequately anticipating the consequences of removing a country's government and establishing a new one.\n\nThe loss of American soldiers is profoundly sorrowful, and the repercussions of the invasion were not foreseen or prepared for by the government. The void of power and subsequent chaos that followed were not adequately addressed. The United States' intervention aimed to implant a democratic government, similar to its efforts in Vietnam, but this was also an ambitious endeavor that would not yield swift success. The government's lack of preparedness for the aftermath, and its initial optimism about a swift victory, were misguided. The war's duration and the ongoing risks to American troops demonstrate the government's underestimation of the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining a democratic regime.\n\nThe ethical dilemma persists, even as the war enters its fifth year. Should the United States remain committed to its intervention, given the potential risks and the ongoing operations to train Iraqi troops and police? The decision to invade Iraq raises questions about the government's motivations, particularly regarding oil resources. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the initial claims, and the contrasting inaction against North Korea, where such weapons are present, casts doubt on the government's rationale for the war. Ultimately, while I hope for a peaceful resolution in Iraq, the likelihood of a swift conclusion seems remote.",
            "I've always been a proponent of same-sex marriage. I believe it to be a matter of personal choice, and recent scientific research suggests that it may have biological underpinnings, rather than being solely the result of societal influences. I think it's inhumane to deny rights to individuals based on something they can't control. Historically, my community has included same-sex couples who've raised families alongside heterosexual ones. These families operate similarly, and it's absurd to suggest that their unions are any less valid or important. I'm against the government's involvement in this personal decision. I'm not convinced that the political climate should dictate who can and cannot marry. Marriage should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle.",
            "When I place something online, it's quite clear that it becomes accessible to the public sphere. It is entirely public. As an R.A., I have personally encountered issues stemming from this. When content is shared, it can significantly influence how others perceive you. If, for instance, you mention explosives or shootings, someone is bound to react. Such content should be refrained from being shared in the public domain. The internet, after all, is visible to everyone. If you're friends with an individual on social platforms like Myspace, you'll receive updates from them. It isn't the school that receives such notifications; rather, someone else does so and reports it. When such information reaches the school, they must address it promptly, as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic outcomes. However, distinguishing between playful banter and serious threats can be challenging. As our school once experienced, a seemingly humorous remark could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat. When shared online, privacy is essentially non-existent. If you wish to maintain privacy, refrain from sharing personal information. You cannot control others' perceptions or how they interpret your content. While I don't believe school officials should be monitoring students' social media, if the information is brought to their attention, there is no invasion of privacy. The school must handle potential dangers seriously, especially when they are reported. I, for example, avoid befriending residents on social media to prevent seeing personal content, such as images from parties, which could deter my ability to maintain a neutral position.",
            "The conflict seems to have persisted for much longer than necessary. Initially, the intention was commendable, aiming to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have since deviated from this noble goal. The extension of the war appears to be more about asserting our global supremacy than about the stated objective. I must also consider that personal animosities, potentially stemming from the previous administration's disputes with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to engage in this war.\n\nThe primary objective of installing a democratic government in a tyrannical state could be deemed justifiable. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict suggests a departure from this original purpose. It feels as though we are now engaged in a never-ending war, driven by a desire to achieve a decisive victory. This persistent involvement is not only emotionally taxing but also financially burdensome.\n\nThe endless expenditure on this war, draining our economy, is particularly concerning. Our nation faces substantial issues such as poverty and infrastructure development that desperately require funding. Instead, billions are being allocated to a conflict that has long since lost its justification.\n\nI believe it is high time we reassess our priorities and end this drawn-out conflict. The Iraqi government must now take responsibility for its own security and governance. Our resources should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic challenges. It is unjustifiable to continue funding a war that has lost its original impetus, especially when there are pressing needs at home.",
            "Could I just clarify something?\n\nWell, it seems someone accessed information online and discovered that certain individuals were engaged in questionable activities. Is that correct?\n\nOf course, the concern about privacy is valid. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, when you post information, it becomes available to a broad audience, even if it's only accessible to those who are friends with you. In a sense, you're granting them permission to view your profile. However, it's important to note that posting anything online means accepting that it might be seen by many.\n\nTo address the issue, it's challenging to have someone continuously monitor all students' profiles. Moreover, it could be seen as discriminatory if only certain students are targeted. But if the discovery was made during a specific investigation, it's understandable. The situation demands context.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I'm always cautious of people who might misuse the information I share. I've seen examples on TV where people can easily access personal details and manipulate others. I've had similar experiences in my classes - strangers knowing my interests, schedule, and friends. It's a delicate balance: I want to communicate with my friends but also protect my privacy.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that her high school had banned Myspace for students, which I found unusual. I'm unsure if that falls under privacy concerns or if the school had the authority to implement such a rule. It's a complex issue, and I'm not certain how to resolve it.",
            "To address the Iraq War, I must preface by noting that I feel an inherent conflict in discussing the topic, given the public sentiment I've personally witnessed. I hesitate to align with the chorus of initial dissent, as it's no longer a primary concern. Nevertheless, the general consensus, both domestic and international, has been overwhelmingly negative. A staggering seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including eight out of ten Iraqis and seven out of ten U.S. troops stationed there, believe the war was a mistake and advocate for our withdrawal within the next year.\n\nHistorically, the Iraq War has been a fiasco, both before and after our involvement. Withdrawing presents its own set of challenges, but staying indefinitely seems unwarranted. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is vast and deeply rooted. The idea that we can impose our democratic ideals on these nations is not only naïve but also disrespectful of their unique cultural identity.\n\nSaddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly tyrannical, but the benefits of deposing him must be weighed against the potential drawbacks of invasion. The situation post-invasion has been compared to quicksand, with Iraq descending into chaos and instability. I struggle to find a compelling reason to continue our presence there, given the overwhelming evidence that the Iraqis themselves want us to leave.\n\nThe administration may have hopeful reasons for prolonging our involvement, but they have yet to present a convincing case. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be an acceptable solution, but immediate withdrawal seems the most logical and compassionate course of action. After all, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, and a quarter wish for an immediate departure. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and their voices should be respected.\n\nIn the event of a withdrawal, if Iraq deteriorates, we can at least point to the Iraqis' decision as the catalyst, and if we decide to intervene later, our intentions would be more genuine. While we may never be seen as heroes in the Middle East, leaving now would be better than our current stance. Simply put, it's time to consider a complete exit strategy.",
            "Indeed, it's undeniable that gender discrimination persists in the United States, extending beyond merely gender and encompassing the specific domain of employment. This bias is not confined to just women; it also affects men and individuals in various other fields, such as fashion or parenting.\n\nIt's quite common, for instance, to encounter situations where a woman is qualified for a position but is not promoted due to historical biases against women in leadership roles. Similarly, a man might face prejudice if he chooses to stay at home to raise his children, as societal expectations often dictate that men are the primary financial providers. In the fashion industry, a man might be dismissed or doubted due to societal perceptions of gender roles and interests.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't confined to gender but also occurs due to one's background or area of origin. For example, someone who grew up on a farm might be overlooked for a high-level position despite their intelligence because of their grammar and accent. These biases highlight the need for continued efforts to address discrimination in all its forms.",
            "In my interpretation, the matter was not explicitly legalized, but rather decriminalized. This shift demoted it from a criminal infraction to a lesser offense, akin to receiving a traffic citation. When someone is apprehended for this, the resultant effects on job prospects and future endeavors, often the most severe they can be, are significantly mitigated. Indeed, while marijuana-related apprehensions may still carry some stigma, the financial burden on communities is considerable. The costs associated with prosecution, incarceration, and legal representation can be substantial. Therefore, many financially distressed communities may be reluctant to adopt such reforms. However, in more liberal environments, such as Denver, this approach can yield significant benefits, including increased funding for education, social programs, and support for vulnerable populations. While open drug use is not universally embraced, the financial implications of decriminalization cannot be ignored. I believe that the societal acceptance of marijuana is a multifaceted issue, and its impact on a community's finances is one critical aspect. Like many substances, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals able to exercise moderation while others may not. Therefore, I do not think it is possible to make generalized statements about the effects of marijuana.",
            "I would say indeed\nAs\nA good deal of their methods are quite conventional\nHaving persisted over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's commendable to remain steadfast in tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible in the face of change\nA notion\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly churchgoing\nAnd\nThey are quite stringent about adhering to their rituals\nSometimes\nI sense a certain disdain for those who do not strictly follow their beliefs\nAnd\nThey seem to reject those who are not perfectly aligned with their doctrine\nOr\nThose belonging to other faiths\nFor instance\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nI apologize\nMy mother was an Episcopalian\nMy father was a Catholic\nAnd they declined to marry them in the Catholic Church\nDue to my father's faith\n\nAnd\nThis isn't truly\nReflective of\nTolerance towards other religions\nWe were always taught to\nEssentially\nLove one another\nA core Catholic tenet\nYet\nIt's contradictory to preach love and simultaneously reject those who do not conform\n\nSo\nI believe many of the Catholic teachings advocate for certain actions\nBut the actual practice often falls short\nDue to its antiquated nature\nYet they persist in maintaining it\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily alter this\nI mean\nI personally believe priests should be allowed to marry\nBut\nI don't think it would essentially deter them from\nPedophilic tendencies\nAs it's a different realm\nIt might not make a difference\nBut I doubt it would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPedophiles may still act that way\nWhether they have a spouse or not\nBecause the nature of the act is different\nSo if they choose to engage in such behavior\nThey likely would, regardless of their marital status\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such acts\nI believe it would happen regardless",

            "I hail from a household steeped in Christian tradition, which has made the topic of homosexuality somewhat ambiguous for me. I have several homosexual friends, and while I may not fully comprehend or align with their lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be legalized. This issue, I contend, should not be a national concern, but rather a matter decided by individual states. After all, a multitude of states lean towards Democratic ideals, which would naturally support gay marriage, while others adhere to Republican values and may not. Thus, one should not dispute the decision of a state where they choose to reside, as it reflects their own ideological alignment. Consequently, the Federal government, including the President, should not impose their will on the matter. I maintain that each state should have the autonomy to decide, as they are the ones who will bear the consequences of their decision. This autonomy is all the more crucial given the brevity of the current president's term, which will soon be succeeded by a new administration with potentially differing views. It is, therefore, logical to cede this decision to the states, as they are the ones who will live with the ramifications of their choice.",

            "Initially, when the war began, I was quite enthusiastic due to the personal impact of the September 11th tragedy. I was driven by a desire to inflict similar chaos as was inflicted upon us. However, with hindsight, I believe we overlooked long-term consequences and entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan. The war ultimately backfired, and our involvement has proven ineffective. My perspective has shifted significantly since then. I now believe that our presence does not hinder the internal strife in the region. As long as they are occupied with their own conflicts, they do not pose a threat to us. My earlier infatuation with the idea of retaliation has subsided, and I now advocate for withdrawal. The war was initially driven by emotion and a desire for revenge, with little consideration for the potential ramifications. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was understandable, given the circumstances, but I contend that we could have adopted a more strategic approach. Our lack of clear objectives and unity only hindered our efforts. The people we sought to transform are, in my opinion, inherently resistant to change. Our prolonged involvement is futile, and the region's instability will persist regardless of our presence. It is in our best interest to disengage and focus on our own affairs."
