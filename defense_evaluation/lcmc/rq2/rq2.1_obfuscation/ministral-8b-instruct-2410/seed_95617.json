            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church requires reform. I have noted that its membership is declining, and I believe this is due to its sometimes stringent stance on various issues. For instance, its position on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as outdated or unyielding. While it's acceptable to have strong convictions, the Church's views on these topics may be alienating to some. I've heard that many people are withdrawing from the Church, disagreeing with their stances on these subjects. For example, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that opposes these beliefs. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married clergy, but I'm unsure if these changes would have prevented the recent issues. Perhaps the Church's dogmatic nature is more to blame. The Church claims its priests are married to God, but I see no reason why they can't also have personal relationships.",
            "I must preface this by saying that I'm not inherently against same-sex marriage. It's not a topic I've extensively examined, but I do have some thoughts on it. I believe that sexual orientation is not something that can be chosen, and thus, individuals should not be held accountable for their orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can marry, while two people of the same sex cannot. It just seems unfair and illogical to me. I think it's more of a personal choice than a societal one, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in it. It's not a security threat, and it's not something that should be disciplined. People should be able to live their lives as they choose, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't think it's the federal government's place to interfere with that.",
            "In regards to the normalization of same-sex unions, I firmly believe that the current legal landscape is not only outdated but also discriminatory. Fundamental arguments against it often hinge on the notion that such relationships pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family, yet this oversimplifies the complex nature of human relationships. Heterosexual and homosexual partnerships, despite their differences, share a multitude of commonalities that render them interchangeable in most practical aspects.\n\nFor instance, the civil and legal rights granted to married couples are extensive, encompassing property taxes and healthcare provisions, among others. The exclusion of same-sex couples from these benefits is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Furthermore, studies have shown that the success rates of homosexual unions are on par with those of their heterosexual counterparts, with similar factors contributing to relational satisfaction.\n\nThe primary contention often lies in the conflation of religious and secular realms. Advocates for same-sex marriage are not seeking religious sanction but rather a civil union recognized by the government. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, should be upheld and respected in this context.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of gay couples on the community and the potential influence on children are often overstated. Research indicates that children of gay parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples, with no significant differences in emotional or social development. The key determinant is not sexual orientation but rather the quality of parenting.\n\nUltimately, I argue for federal legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide. The current patchwork of state laws is inefficient and discriminatory. The federal government should take a leadership role in this matter, rather than leaving it to individual states to decide. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that any legislation must be informed by evidence-based research and not merely religious or cultural biases.\n\nPresident Bush's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in his religious beliefs, which is understandable. However, it is problematic when these beliefs are translated into public policy, particularly given the federal government's historical stance on religious neutrality. The recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance, for example, illustrates the sensitivity around religious symbols in public life.\n\nLastly, it is essential to dispel the misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. The notion that it is a result of psychological trauma or personality defects has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The American Psychological Association, among other authoritative institutions, has refuted such claims. It is imperative that public discourse on this topic is informed by empirical evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural biases.",
            "In the course of my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a recurring theme that often confounds me: the stigma surrounding certain substances. While it's true that the illegality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its lack of potential benefits, I must assert that my stance is nuanced. I affirm that while the public consumption of these substances should be restricted, their medicinal use should be considered.\n\nTo elucidate, consider the controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, which are widely used in medical settings despite their legality. These substances are not without their perils, but their benefits are undeniable. Marijuana, in my opinion, possesses similar potential. However, the public perception of marijuana as a harmful substance detracts from its responsible use.\n\nI propose a gradual legalization process, beginning with the elimination of the stigma associated with marijuana. This could be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. By doing so, I believe we can foster an environment where marijuana is used responsibly, both medically and recreationally.",
            "Well, over the years, the church has certainly evolved to better reflect the spirit of the twenty-first century. It's no longer as stringent as it once was. As a child, my Sundays were filled with church attendance, complete with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. I even attended a private school where many of my friends frequented the church on weekends. However, as I've grown older, the church has made notable adaptations. For instance, they've introduced a youth service that's only thirty minutes long, and the attire has become significantly more casual. Even in the morning masses, I now see people in jeans and khakis, a stark contrast to the more formal attire of the past. The church I know has indeed undergone these changes, but I'm not privy to the internal politics or the intricacies of its leadership. That's the extent of my observations.\n\nRegarding your questions about the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe that these incidents couldn't have been entirely prevented by the church simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. The root of the problem lies within the individual, not the institution. Some married individuals struggle with pedophilia, and their marital status doesn't alter their predispositions. If a person is predisposed to such behavior, they may seek it out regardless of marital status. The choice to become a priest is a personal one, and if someone feels called to the priesthood despite wanting to marry, they might consider a different faith that permits it, like Seventh Heaven, where ministers and reverends can marry.\n\nTo further clarify, I believe that sexual attraction, including pedophilia, is largely genetic. I don't think it's something that can be entirely influenced by upbringing or societal changes. Marriage, while it can provide a support system, doesn't change someone's genetic makeup. Therefore, I don't believe the church could have prevented these incidents through societal changes alone. If the church was aware of these cases and endeavored to cover them up, that would indeed be despicable, but I suspect that in many cases, the church may not have been aware of these incidents.",
            "In the wake of the September 11th events, I initially found the initial premise acceptable. However, I soon realized that the collective shock and grief made it easy for the Iraq War to be framed as a response to Osama Bin Laden and the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These claims were later debunked, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. The Bush administration's handling of the situation has always been a source of frustration for me, as the administration's lies about the justification for war have never been adequately addressed, even by those who were directly involved.\n\nI find it particularly galling that Colin Powell, who once presented the case for war with such conviction, now admits he was not persuaded by the evidence at the time. This, to me, is a clear example of malfeasance in office, approaching an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is not just an issue of the past; it has been ongoing since 9/11, with a clear intent to expand our energy supply and settle old scores, specifically with Saddam Hussein.\n\nWithdrawing from Iraq now could potentially lead to a civil war, with more lives lost. The proposed alternative—an intervention by neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also does not inspire confidence. The long-term stability of Iraq's sovereignty is uncertain, with the interim government's effectiveness questionable and radical elements vying for control.",

Like, the attacks on September 11th. But now, I'm not sure it's making much sense. It's like, we're trying to build democracy there, which takes time, and we're doing it for our own interests too, like oil. It's just, it's not helping matters much.

It's like, we're not at war with them, really. It's just a bunch of soldiers stationed there. It's like, we're showing off our power, but it's not a real war. And it shouldn't be called one. But, I don't know, I'm not sure if I should want it to end. It's just, it's complicated. It's like we're interfering in their culture and making things worse. It's like, we're trying to change them into something they're not. And it's going to end up causing more problems. I mean, there's so much going on there. It's like, it's a mess.

            "I’m hesitant to endorse the notion of making it legally binding or for a state to even recognize its legitimacy. I firmly believe that the decision should rest with the religious institutions, as the Constitution explicitly advocates for the separation of church and state. The guidelines are crystal clear, and any attempt to impose regulations or exert control over this issue would be a direct contradiction of the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Consequently, I maintain that the decision to legalize or ban this practice should not be imposed by the government but rather left to the discretion of religious bodies.\n\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that those advocating for its illegality are prioritizing one religious belief over others, as historical records indicate that the majority of Christians, particularly Catholics, are opposed to this practice. It is my perspective that the government should not impose its will on matters of faith and belief, as the Constitution promotes religious tolerance and freedom. Furthermore, I am skeptical about the proposed amendment, as I believe it would be a rare instance where the government seeks to restrict the people rather than itself.\n\nMy stance is that neither the federal government nor any other authority should intervene in this matter. The push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader societal or economic concerns. I do not foresee any significant impact on the economy or society as a result of this practice, and I believe that it could potentially have a positive effect on societal well-being. In essence, I maintain that the final decision should be left to the churches, and I do not see any compelling reasons to alter the current legal status through an amendment.",
            "In the realm of historical context, the war in Iraq is a topic that has long been a subject of scrutiny and debate. To commence, I firmly believe that the authorities did not provide the populace with a candid account of the reasons behind the decision to invade Iraq. The association drawn between the war and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's indignation to rally support for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI, myself, am staunchly opposed to military intervention, particularly when it involves preventive strikes. The conflict in Iraq, however, is a stark reminder of the Vietnam War's echoes. The American government's failure to adequately prepare for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued following the removal of the Iraqi government is a glaring oversight. The government's inability to anticipate the vacuum of power and the subsequent insurgency is a poignant lesson not learned from the past.\n\nThe efforts to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of similar attempts in Vietnam, have proven to be a lengthy and arduous process. The US government's portrayal of a swift, successful campaign was, in hindsight, naive. Building a functional democracy takes time, as our own history attests, and the government's optimism about the ease of this endeavor was misplaced.\n\nThe decision to engage in war is a complex one, and the 2004 presidential election was a pivotal moment in my political awakening. I found myself grappling with the decision to support George W. Bush's continuation of the Iraq occupation. The responsibility to honor the sacrifices made and the lives lost is a heavy one, but so too is the responsibility to weigh the cost in human lives against the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. The question of whether our intervention was motivated by altruism or strategic interests, particularly concerns over oil resources, is one that has fueled ongoing debate.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a reminder of the intricacies of foreign policy and the challenges of nation-building. Despite the best intentions, the ultimate outcome often depends on factors beyond our control. It is my sincere hope that the conflict will conclude soon, and that peace will prevail in the region, though I remain skeptical of such a swift resolution.",
            "I've always held the belief in the rightness of same-sex unions. It's a deeply personal choice, one that many now recognize as potentially having biological underpinnings rather than being solely influenced by societal norms. It seems inequitable to me that individuals might face reduced rights based on something largely beyond their control. I find it disheartening to think that people could be denied the same rights and opportunities due to their orientation. I've long been an advocate for full acceptance and equality in this regard.\n\nPolitics and government often interject themselves where they shouldn't. This is a matter of personal and household concern, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples, functioning just as any other family would, despite not being officially married due to legal restrictions. It's these everyday, ordinary examples that underscore the need for change.\n\nThe notion of interpreting the sacred institution of marriage through a political lens can be seen as an overreach. I've seen compelling evidence suggesting that sexual orientation might have biological roots, as opposed to being shaped solely by environment and upbringing. This perspective challenges the notion that such unions are any less valid or natural. It's akin to saying that individuals predisposed to heterosexuality should be denied marriage if they were raised in a single-parent household with multiple sisters, for instance.\n\nMoreover, the double standard seems glaring. Heterosexual couples can elope, marriage licenses aside, while same-sex couples often face public scrutiny and media attention. Marital choices, in my view, should be private affairs, not public spectacles.",
            "Posting something on the internet is akin to sharing it with the entire world. It's public, plain and simple. As a Resident Assistant, I've faced this issue firsthand. When you place something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you discuss volatile topics such as violence, you can't escape scrutiny. The internet, after all, is accessible to everyone. If a friend on Myspace sees something concerning, they might inform the school. They can't ignore such information, as they must prevent potential dangers. However, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes, people jest about such topics, and it might just be a misunderstanding. In our school, an incident occurred where someone misinterpreted a post as a threat. The person in question had intended it as a joke, but the situation escalated due to the context. It's essential to remember that the internet is a public space. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your posts. However, if school officials are made aware of a potential threat through legitimate means, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't, however, snoop through students' social media accounts under false pretenses. If a student brings it to their attention, it falls under a different category. In conclusion, while the internet is a public forum, it's crucial to be mindful of what you post and who you share it with.",

Initially, it seemed the goal was to instill democratic principles in a nation, but over time, that objective appears to have been lost sight of. It seems we are now engaged in this endeavor more for the sake of global dominance than for any clear political purpose. I believe the initial motivations were questionable, possibly influenced by personal connections between the current and previous administrations. If the purpose was to introduce democracy into a system lacking it, that was a noble aim. However, if personal concerns played a part, then I question the fairness of the cause. I believe our objective was made clear within the first few months of the conflict, yet it has persisted for years.\n\nI maintain that the war's duration has reached a point where it is no longer serving its initial purpose. It feels as if we are engaged in this for the sake of engaging in it, and we are reluctant to end it without a clear victory. I believe it is time to reconsider our involvement, as the local government is now capable of managing its affairs independently. Moreover, our economy is bearing the brunt of this conflict, as we invest billions in a war while our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure, remain unaddressed. It seems our resources would be better spent on our own citizens' well-being rather than sustaining a war that has lost its focus. The immense financial investment in this conflict is a drain on our economy and should be redirected towards more pressing domestic needs.\n\nI believe it is time to reassess our involvement and prioritize our own internal projects and improvements.",
            "Regarding your recent inquiry, I'd like to pose a question to clarify the situation. It seems that a certain event was averted due to someone's online activity. Notably, on platforms like Myspace, one's information is publicly accessible, much like a storefront. To access someone's profile, one typically needs to be their \"friend,\" thereby granting permission for that person to view their profile. However, I acknowledge that sharing information online inherently invites scrutiny.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain how one would effectively monitor all students' online activities. While it's understandable that schools might want to ensure students' safety, it's crucial to consider the potential for bias and invasion. If a school were to assign someone to monitor profiles, it could potentially lead to targeted surveillance. This raises ethical concerns, as it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI, for one, maintain a Facebook account, though I'm conscious that it's a double-edged sword. There are certainly unsavory individuals who can exploit this information for nefarious purposes. A television program I watched highlighted a man who managed to find a girl's screen name and engage with her within minutes, ultimately arranging a meeting. Personally, I wouldn't meet someone I don't know, but I've had classmates who recognize me, despite not knowing my screen name. This raises concerns about privacy, as they can piece together information about my life.\n\nBalancing the benefits of social media with the risks is tricky. I only accept friend requests from acquaintances, but it's impossible to know who might be looking at one's profile. My roommate mentioned that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed quite restrictive. I question the school's authority to impose such a restriction.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns, I believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and safety.",
            "Indeed,\nI find myself compelled to discuss the Iraq War one more time, though I must admit, I hesitate as it's a topic that often feels insincere when addressed.\nYou see, I was opposed from the outset, yet it's wiser not to dwell on sentiments that no longer matter.\nIt's evident that the majority of the world, including the Iraqis themselves, view the war negatively, with upwards of eighty percent supporting a swift withdrawal.\nThe troops stationed there, too, share this sentiment, with a significant portion believing a departure within the year is necessary.\nThe situation is, and has been, a catastrophe from the moment we entered, and it's clear our presence has only exacerbated this.\nThe Middle East's cultural differences pose a formidable obstacle to our attempts to impose Western ideals.\nSaddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrant, but the cost of intervention was not justified, given the potential for chaos and instability.\nMy perspective is that we should exit immediately, and though I understand the administration may have reasons for extending our stay, I remain unconvinced.\nThe Iraqis themselves, who we claim to be helping, have expressed desires for our departure, and listening to them should be our priority.\nIf they request our withdrawal, it would remove us from the equation should the situation deteriorate further.\nAfter all, while we may never be seen as saviors in the region, at least we would have acted on the will of those we claim to support.",
            "It is evident that gender discrimination persists in the United States, albeit in various forms. While not exclusively targeting women, certain occupations may still harbor biases. For instance, the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women encounter barriers to advancement despite equal qualifications, remains a challenge. This is partly due to societal perceptions that women are less suited for upper-management roles.\n\nMoreover, roles that were historically male-dominated, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face societal disapproval. Conversely, men in fields like fashion may face skepticism due to societal perceptions of their gender and lifestyle. Change, though gradual, is underway as more women secure executive positions and gain acceptance in the business world. Similarly, the acceptance of male stay-at-home parents is growing.\n\nAddressing these issues involves promoting the unique qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than forcefully pushing for change. This approach respects the pace of societal evolution and acknowledges the progress already made. Additionally, barriers due to regional backgrounds and educational levels also exist. For instance, a CEO with a rural upbringing might face discrimination due to less-than-perfect grammar. These examples illustrate the complex nature of discrimination and the need for ongoing efforts to combat it.",
            "The understanding is that it hasn't been legalized, but rather, decriminalized. This shift reduces the severity of the offense from a criminal one to something more akin to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic ticket. For instance, instead of being arrested and processed through the legal system, individuals are simply cited. This change doesn't eliminate the potential future impacts, such as those on employment prospects, but it does reduce the immediate legal consequences and associated costs. The cost of law enforcement and court proceedings is substantial, particularly for financially struggling municipalities. Therefore, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana. However, in places like Denver, where the social and political climate is more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as a viable option. This can free up resources for community services, such as education, social programs for the elderly, and aid for the homeless. It's important to strike a balance; while marijuana should not be prevalent everywhere, its decriminalization can have financial benefits. However, it's crucial to consider the societal implications, such as the acceptability of openly smoking marijuana and the potential impact on driving safety. Both alcohol and marijuana can affect individuals differently, with each substance having its own set of potential negative effects. No two people react the same to substances, and personal moderation is key. Despite the differences in individual reactions, both substances have their own adverse effects. The general consensus is that they both should be approached with caution.",
            "I would lean towards affirming the notion\nGiven that\nMany of their practices are steeped in tradition\nThus, they've maintained the same rituals over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to remain anchored in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to be flexible to change\nIndeed\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly attendance at Mass\nAnd\nThey're stringent about maintaining certain protocols\nAdditionally\nThere's a perception that the Catholic Church exhibits a certain attitude towards those who deviate from the doctrine\nEven\nIt seems that they're not receptive to individuals who aren't fully aligned with the Catholic faith\nMoreover\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith union was declined by the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian background\nClearly\nThis isn't a demonstration of tolerance towards other religions\nDespite being taught to love others, the Catholic Church's practice often contradicts this principle\nIn essence, the doctrine instructs one to love and accept all, yet the Church's behavior suggests otherwise\nIt's as if the Church is wedded to outdated practices which they continue to uphold\n\nI don't believe this situation would significantly impact the issue\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to marry might be a positive step\nBut\nI don't anticipate it would prevent pedophilic behavior\nAs\nIt lies in a different sphere\nMoreover\nIndividuals who commit such acts would likely continue to do so irrespective of their marital status\nSince the target isn't a spouse but a child\nIt appears that such acts would transpire regardless of marriage status\nTherefore, I don't think permitting priests to marry would mitigate these issues",
            "I'm still deliberating on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I must admit, I'm torn. On one hand, it's a highly sensitive topic, balancing on the precipice of church and state. Defining marriage, especially when it comes to same-sex unions, is a thorny endeavor, as it involves navigating complex social and legal landscapes.\n\nI believe that, in terms of government recognition, civil unions are the way to go. If two people choose to unite, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or cultural context? After all, people who are baptized or belong to certain religions don't receive special government treatment based on that alone. Therefore, I think the government should approach the matter with a neutral stance, recognizing the union for what it is.\n\nIf all states can agree on a logical course of action, then I believe a federal law should be implemented. However, I firmly believe that amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach. This would be a disproportionate response to a complex social issue. It's not that I don't believe in the importance of the issue, but I don't believe it's significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't support amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It's not the right approach to address this matter.",
            "Growing up in a religious household, the subject of homosexuality has been a complex and intriguing topic for me. While I have a plethora of friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I must admit that I have reservations about their lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the legalization of same-sex relations and advocate for a state-by-state decision process rather than a federal one. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its stance on the matter, as policies should reflect the values and beliefs of the people who live there. Furthermore, I find it problematic when a national figure, such as the president, attempts to impose their views on the entire country. After all, they do not reside in every state, and their policies should not supersede the collective will of the people living in their respective communities. Therefore, I stand in favor of leaving these decisions in the hands of the individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately bear the consequences of their choices.",
            "Well, to begin with, I don't think it's accurate to assert that MySpace is a private platform. According to the definition, it's a bulletin board meant for public consumption. When we put something online, we should expect various individuals, including educators, to view it. It's a public sphere, and while I understand the concern about privacy, if the information is accessible to the public, it's not a violation per se. However, if the intent is purely to monitor students' activities to maintain a safer environment, that's a different story.\n\nConsider, for instance, if a student posts about their involvement in harmful activities. If the school officials witness this and it aids in preventing a tragedy, like a school shooting, can we really call that an invasion of privacy? It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's acceptable to use public platforms for this purpose when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of students.\n\nI must admit, I've often hesitated to express myself freely online, even through electronic communication. I'm not particularly eager to share anything that could potentially be used against me later. The digital trail we leave behind can come back to haunt us. I've had experiences where I've refrained from sharing even mundane facts about others due to fear of misinterpretation. It's a constant vigilance, and I believe it's a prudent practice, especially for students who might not understand the full implications of their online actions.\n\nBut, returning to the topic at hand, if the information accessed is used to enhance the safety of the school environment, it's not an invasion. It's more about the integrity and responsibility of the school system to ensure a safe space for its students. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe and secure environment when they entrust them to the system.\n\nFurthermore, schools have been proactive in preparing for various threats, including school shootings. Lockdown drills, security protocols, and surveillance are all measures taken to safeguard students. In this context, if school officials are using available information to maintain this safe environment, I wouldn't consider it an invasion of privacy. Instead, it's a responsibility they've undertaken to ensure the well-being of their students.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I understand the concern about privacy, I believe the balance tips towards the responsibility and the necessity of the school system to ensure the safety of its students, especially in the context of a potentially dangerous situation like a school shooting.",
            "In the aftermath of the devastating events of September 11th, I was initially swayed by a strong desire for retribution. The sentiment was understandable, as the attacks hit close to home. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea of invading and causing as much upheaval as the terrorists had done here. However, with hindsight, it's clear that we overlooked many critical factors and acted impulsively, without a well-thought-out plan. The decision to go to war was emotionally driven and lacked a clear strategy. We entered the conflict underprepared, unaware of what we would face and the unique nature of warfare in that region. The mindset was largely one of vengeance, rather than rational consideration of long-term consequences or cultural differences.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, to some extent, a response to public sentiment. However, it appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a carefully considered policy. The lack of a clear plan for what to do once in Iraq only exacerbated the situation. The absence of a cohesive strategy and unity of purpose among our forces made it challenging to establish order. It is my belief that we were more driven by anger and revenge than by a genuine desire to improve the lives of the people in Iraq.\n\nMoreover, I have come to question the effectiveness of our involvement in the region. The constant conflict has been more harmful than helpful. The people of Iraq seem to be more focused on their internal struggles than on improving their country, and our presence there has not significantly altered this dynamic. I believe that our continued engagement in the area is more likely to exacerbate the problems than to resolve them. Ultimately, I feel that we should step back and allow the region to find its own path, rather than attempting to impose our will from the outside.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice was understandable, the execution of our military efforts was flawed. We acted impulsively and failed to consider the long-term implications and cultural differences. The ongoing conflict has not produced the desired results, and I believe that our withdrawal is the best course of action."

you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church requires reform. I have noted that its membership is declining, and I believe this is due to its sometimes stringent stance on various issues. For instance, its position on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as outdated or unyielding. While it's acceptable to have strong convictions, the Church's views on these topics may be alienating to some. I've heard that many people are withdrawing from the Church, disagreeing with their stances on these subjects. For example, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that opposes these beliefs. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married clergy, but I'm unsure if these changes would have prevented the recent issues. Perhaps the Church's dogmatic nature is more to blame. The Church claims its priests are married to God, but I see no reason why they can't also have personal relationships.",
            "I must preface this by saying that I'm not inherently against same-sex marriage. It's not a topic I've extensively examined, but I do have some thoughts on it. I believe that sexual orientation is not something that can be chosen, and thus, individuals should not be held accountable for their orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can marry, while two people of the same sex cannot. It just seems unfair and illogical to me. I think it's more of a personal choice than a societal one, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in it. It's not a security threat, and it's not something that should be disciplined. People should be able to live their lives as they choose, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't think it's the federal government's place to interfere with that.",
            "In regards to the normalization of same-sex unions, I firmly believe that the current legal landscape is not only outdated but also discriminatory. Fundamental arguments against it often hinge on the notion that such relationships pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family, yet this oversimplifies the complex nature of human relationships. Heterosexual and homosexual partnerships, despite their differences, share a multitude of commonalities that render them interchangeable in most practical aspects.\n\nFor instance, the civil and legal rights granted to married couples are extensive, encompassing property taxes and healthcare provisions, among others. The exclusion of same-sex couples from these benefits is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Furthermore, studies have shown that the success rates of homosexual unions are on par with those of their heterosexual counterparts, with similar factors contributing to relational satisfaction.\n\nThe primary contention often lies in the conflation of religious and secular realms. Advocates for same-sex marriage are not seeking religious sanction but rather a civil union recognized by the government. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, should be upheld and respected in this context.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of gay couples on the community and the potential influence on children are often overstated. Research indicates that children of gay parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples, with no significant differences in emotional or social development. The key determinant is not sexual orientation but rather the quality of parenting.\n\nUltimately, I argue for federal legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide. The current patchwork of state laws is inefficient and discriminatory. The federal government should take a leadership role in this matter, rather than leaving it to individual states to decide. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that any legislation must be informed by evidence-based research and not merely religious or cultural biases.\n\nPresident Bush's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in his religious beliefs, which is understandable. However, it is problematic when these beliefs are translated into public policy, particularly given the federal government's historical stance on religious neutrality. The recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance, for example, illustrates the sensitivity around religious symbols in public life.\n\nLastly, it is essential to dispel the misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. The notion that it is a result of psychological trauma or personality defects has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The American Psychological Association, among other authoritative institutions, has refuted such claims. It is imperative that public discourse on this topic is informed by empirical evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural biases.",
            "In the course of my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a recurring theme that often confounds me: the stigma surrounding certain substances. While it's true that the illegality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its lack of potential benefits, I must assert that my stance is nuanced. I affirm that while the public consumption of these substances should be restricted, their medicinal use should be considered.\n\nTo elucidate, consider the controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, which are widely used in medical settings despite their legality. These substances are not without their perils, but their benefits are undeniable. Marijuana, in my opinion, possesses similar potential. However, the public perception of marijuana as a harmful substance detracts from its responsible use.\n\nI propose a gradual legalization process, beginning with the elimination of the stigma associated with marijuana. This could be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. By doing so, I believe we can foster an environment where marijuana is used responsibly, both medically and recreationally.",
            "Well, over the years, the church has certainly evolved to better reflect the spirit of the twenty-first century. It's no longer as stringent as it once was. As a child, my Sundays were filled with church attendance, complete with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. I even attended a private school where many of my friends frequented the church on weekends. However, as I've grown older, the church has made notable adaptations. For instance, they've introduced a youth service that's only thirty minutes long, and the attire has become significantly more casual. Even in the morning masses, I now see people in jeans and khakis, a stark contrast to the more formal attire of the past. The church I know has indeed undergone these changes, but I'm not privy to the internal politics or the intricacies of its leadership. That's the extent of my observations.\n\nRegarding your questions about the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe that these incidents couldn't have been entirely prevented by the church simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. The root of the problem lies within the individual, not the institution. Some married individuals struggle with pedophilia, and their marital status doesn't alter their predispositions. If a person is predisposed to such behavior, they may seek it out regardless of marital status. The choice to become a priest is a personal one, and if someone feels called to the priesthood despite wanting to marry, they might consider a different faith that permits it, like Seventh Heaven, where ministers and reverends can marry.\n\nTo further clarify, I believe that sexual attraction, including pedophilia, is largely genetic. I don't think it's something that can be entirely influenced by upbringing or societal changes. Marriage, while it can provide a support system, doesn't change someone's genetic makeup. Therefore, I don't believe the church could have prevented these incidents through societal changes alone. If the church was aware of these cases and endeavored to cover them up, that would indeed be despicable, but I suspect that in many cases, the church may not have been aware of these incidents.",
            "In the wake of the September 11th events, I initially found the initial premise acceptable. However, I soon realized that the collective shock and grief made it easy for the Iraq War to be framed as a response to Osama Bin Laden and the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These claims were later debunked, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. The Bush administration's handling of the situation has always been a source of frustration for me, as the administration's lies about the justification for war have never been adequately addressed, even by those who were directly involved.\n\nI find it particularly galling that Colin Powell, who once presented the case for war with such conviction, now admits he was not persuaded by the evidence at the time. This, to me, is a clear example of malfeasance in office, approaching an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is not just an issue of the past; it has been ongoing since 9/11, with a clear intent to expand our energy supply and settle old scores, specifically with Saddam Hussein.\n\nWithdrawing from Iraq now could potentially lead to a civil war, with more lives lost. The proposed alternative—an intervention by neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also does not inspire confidence. The long-term stability of Iraq's sovereignty is uncertain, with the interim government's effectiveness questionable and radical elements vying for control.",
            "Hmm, let's see. What's this about? Oh, the war in Iraq. Okay. Well, it's like, I don't know much about it, really. It feels, I mean, it started as a response to something, right? Like, the attacks on September 11th. But now, I'm not sure it's making much sense. It's like, we're trying to build democracy there, which takes time, and we're doing it for our own interests too, like oil. It's just, it's not helping matters much. And if we stay, we'll be stuck there forever, trying to keep the peace, and if we leave, it'll be like we abandoned them. It's a tough situation. I don't know, it's hard to say if it's worth it. It's like, we're not at war with them, really. It's just a bunch of soldiers stationed there. It's like, we're showing off our power, but it's not a real war. And it shouldn't be called one. But, I don't know, I'm not sure if I should want it to end. It's just, it's complicated. It's like we're interfering in their culture and making things worse. It's like, we're trying to change them into something they're not. And it's going to end up causing more problems. I mean, there's so much going on there. It's like, it's a mess.

            "I’m hesitant to endorse the notion of making it legally binding or for a state to even recognize its legitimacy. I firmly believe that the decision should rest with the religious institutions, as the Constitution explicitly advocates for the separation of church and state. The guidelines are crystal clear, and any attempt to impose regulations or exert control over this issue would be a direct contradiction of the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Consequently, I maintain that the decision to legalize or ban this practice should not be imposed by the government but rather left to the discretion of religious bodies.\n\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that those advocating for its illegality are prioritizing one religious belief over others, as historical records indicate that the majority of Christians, particularly Catholics, are opposed to this practice. It is my perspective that the government should not impose its will on matters of faith and belief, as the Constitution promotes religious tolerance and freedom. Furthermore, I am skeptical about the proposed amendment, as I believe it would be a rare instance where the government seeks to restrict the people rather than itself.\n\nMy stance is that neither the federal government nor any other authority should intervene in this matter. The push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader societal or economic concerns. I do not foresee any significant impact on the economy or society as a result of this practice, and I believe that it could potentially have a positive effect on societal well-being. In essence, I maintain that the final decision should be left to the churches, and I do not see any compelling reasons to alter the current legal status through an amendment.",
            "In the realm of historical context, the war in Iraq is a topic that has long been a subject of scrutiny and debate. To commence, I firmly believe that the authorities did not provide the populace with a candid account of the reasons behind the decision to invade Iraq. The association drawn between the war and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's indignation to rally support for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI, myself, am staunchly opposed to military intervention, particularly when it involves preventive strikes. The conflict in Iraq, however, is a stark reminder of the Vietnam War's echoes. The American government's failure to adequately prepare for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued following the removal of the Iraqi government is a glaring oversight. The government's inability to anticipate the vacuum of power and the subsequent insurgency is a poignant lesson not learned from the past.\n\nThe efforts to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of similar attempts in Vietnam, have proven to be a lengthy and arduous process. The US government's portrayal of a swift, successful campaign was, in hindsight, naive. Building a functional democracy takes time, as our own history attests, and the government's optimism about the ease of this endeavor was misplaced.\n\nThe decision to engage in war is a complex one, and the 2004 presidential election was a pivotal moment in my political awakening. I found myself grappling with the decision to support George W. Bush's continuation of the Iraq occupation. The responsibility to honor the sacrifices made and the lives lost is a heavy one, but so too is the responsibility to weigh the cost in human lives against the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. The question of whether our intervention was motivated by altruism or strategic interests, particularly concerns over oil resources, is one that has fueled ongoing debate.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a reminder of the intricacies of foreign policy and the challenges of nation-building. Despite the best intentions, the ultimate outcome often depends on factors beyond our control. It is my sincere hope that the conflict will conclude soon, and that peace will prevail in the region, though I remain skeptical of such a swift resolution.",
            "I've always held the belief in the rightness of same-sex unions. It's a deeply personal choice, one that many now recognize as potentially having biological underpinnings rather than being solely influenced by societal norms. It seems inequitable to me that individuals might face reduced rights based on something largely beyond their control. I find it disheartening to think that people could be denied the same rights and opportunities due to their orientation. I've long been an advocate for full acceptance and equality in this regard.\n\nPolitics and government often interject themselves where they shouldn't. This is a matter of personal and household concern, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples, functioning just as any other family would, despite not being officially married due to legal restrictions. It's these everyday, ordinary examples that underscore the need for change.\n\nThe notion of interpreting the sacred institution of marriage through a political lens can be seen as an overreach. I've seen compelling evidence suggesting that sexual orientation might have biological roots, as opposed to being shaped solely by environment and upbringing. This perspective challenges the notion that such unions are any less valid or natural. It's akin to saying that individuals predisposed to heterosexuality should be denied marriage if they were raised in a single-parent household with multiple sisters, for instance.\n\nMoreover, the double standard seems glaring. Heterosexual couples can elope, marriage licenses aside, while same-sex couples often face public scrutiny and media attention. Marital choices, in my view, should be private affairs, not public spectacles.",
            "Posting something on the internet is akin to sharing it with the entire world. It's public, plain and simple. As a Resident Assistant, I've faced this issue firsthand. When you place something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you discuss volatile topics such as violence, you can't escape scrutiny. The internet, after all, is accessible to everyone. If a friend on Myspace sees something concerning, they might inform the school. They can't ignore such information, as they must prevent potential dangers. However, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes, people jest about such topics, and it might just be a misunderstanding. In our school, an incident occurred where someone misinterpreted a post as a threat. The person in question had intended it as a joke, but the situation escalated due to the context. It's essential to remember that the internet is a public space. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your posts. However, if school officials are made aware of a potential threat through legitimate means, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't, however, snoop through students' social media accounts under false pretenses. If a student brings it to their attention, it falls under a different category. In conclusion, while the internet is a public forum, it's crucial to be mindful of what you post and who you share it with.",
            "The conflict has stretched on interminably, and I find it hard to discern the original intent. Initially, it seemed the goal was to instill democratic principles in a nation, but over time, that objective appears to have been lost sight of. It seems we are now engaged in this endeavor more for the sake of global dominance than for any clear political purpose. I believe the initial motivations were questionable, possibly influenced by personal connections between the current and previous administrations. If the purpose was to introduce democracy into a system lacking it, that was a noble aim. However, if personal concerns played a part, then I question the fairness of the cause. I believe our objective was made clear within the first few months of the conflict, yet it has persisted for years.\n\nI maintain that the war's duration has reached a point where it is no longer serving its initial purpose. It feels as if we are engaged in this for the sake of engaging in it, and we are reluctant to end it without a clear victory. I believe it is time to reconsider our involvement, as the local government is now capable of managing its affairs independently. Moreover, our economy is bearing the brunt of this conflict, as we invest billions in a war while our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure, remain unaddressed. It seems our resources would be better spent on our own citizens' well-being rather than sustaining a war that has lost its focus. The immense financial investment in this conflict is a drain on our economy and should be redirected towards more pressing domestic needs.\n\nI believe it is time to reassess our involvement and prioritize our own internal projects and improvements.",
            "Regarding your recent inquiry, I'd like to pose a question to clarify the situation. It seems that a certain event was averted due to someone's online activity. Notably, on platforms like Myspace, one's information is publicly accessible, much like a storefront. To access someone's profile, one typically needs to be their \"friend,\" thereby granting permission for that person to view their profile. However, I acknowledge that sharing information online inherently invites scrutiny.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain how one would effectively monitor all students' online activities. While it's understandable that schools might want to ensure students' safety, it's crucial to consider the potential for bias and invasion. If a school were to assign someone to monitor profiles, it could potentially lead to targeted surveillance. This raises ethical concerns, as it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI, for one, maintain a Facebook account, though I'm conscious that it's a double-edged sword. There are certainly unsavory individuals who can exploit this information for nefarious purposes. A television program I watched highlighted a man who managed to find a girl's screen name and engage with her within minutes, ultimately arranging a meeting. Personally, I wouldn't meet someone I don't know, but I've had classmates who recognize me, despite not knowing my screen name. This raises concerns about privacy, as they can piece together information about my life.\n\nBalancing the benefits of social media with the risks is tricky. I only accept friend requests from acquaintances, but it's impossible to know who might be looking at one's profile. My roommate mentioned that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed quite restrictive. I question the school's authority to impose such a restriction.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns, I believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and safety.",
            "Indeed,\nI find myself compelled to discuss the Iraq War one more time, though I must admit, I hesitate as it's a topic that often feels insincere when addressed.\nYou see, I was opposed from the outset, yet it's wiser not to dwell on sentiments that no longer matter.\nIt's evident that the majority of the world, including the Iraqis themselves, view the war negatively, with upwards of eighty percent supporting a swift withdrawal.\nThe troops stationed there, too, share this sentiment, with a significant portion believing a departure within the year is necessary.\nThe situation is, and has been, a catastrophe from the moment we entered, and it's clear our presence has only exacerbated this.\nThe Middle East's cultural differences pose a formidable obstacle to our attempts to impose Western ideals.\nSaddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrant, but the cost of intervention was not justified, given the potential for chaos and instability.\nMy perspective is that we should exit immediately, and though I understand the administration may have reasons for extending our stay, I remain unconvinced.\nThe Iraqis themselves, who we claim to be helping, have expressed desires for our departure, and listening to them should be our priority.\nIf they request our withdrawal, it would remove us from the equation should the situation deteriorate further.\nAfter all, while we may never be seen as saviors in the region, at least we would have acted on the will of those we claim to support.",
            "It is evident that gender discrimination persists in the United States, albeit in various forms. While not exclusively targeting women, certain occupations may still harbor biases. For instance, the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women encounter barriers to advancement despite equal qualifications, remains a challenge. This is partly due to societal perceptions that women are less suited for upper-management roles.\n\nMoreover, roles that were historically male-dominated, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face societal disapproval. Conversely, men in fields like fashion may face skepticism due to societal perceptions of their gender and lifestyle. Change, though gradual, is underway as more women secure executive positions and gain acceptance in the business world. Similarly, the acceptance of male stay-at-home parents is growing.\n\nAddressing these issues involves promoting the unique qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than forcefully pushing for change. This approach respects the pace of societal evolution and acknowledges the progress already made. Additionally, barriers due to regional backgrounds and educational levels also exist. For instance, a CEO with a rural upbringing might face discrimination due to less-than-perfect grammar. These examples illustrate the complex nature of discrimination and the need for ongoing efforts to combat it.",
            "The understanding is that it hasn't been legalized, but rather, decriminalized. This shift reduces the severity of the offense from a criminal one to something more akin to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic ticket. For instance, instead of being arrested and processed through the legal system, individuals are simply cited. This change doesn't eliminate the potential future impacts, such as those on employment prospects, but it does reduce the immediate legal consequences and associated costs. The cost of law enforcement and court proceedings is substantial, particularly for financially struggling municipalities. Therefore, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana. However, in places like Denver, where the social and political climate is more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as a viable option. This can free up resources for community services, such as education, social programs for the elderly, and aid for the homeless. It's important to strike a balance; while marijuana should not be prevalent everywhere, its decriminalization can have financial benefits. However, it's crucial to consider the societal implications, such as the acceptability of openly smoking marijuana and the potential impact on driving safety. Both alcohol and marijuana can affect individuals differently, with each substance having its own set of potential negative effects. No two people react the same to substances, and personal moderation is key. Despite the differences in individual reactions, both substances have their own adverse effects. The general consensus is that they both should be approached with caution.",
            "I would lean towards affirming the notion\nGiven that\nMany of their practices are steeped in tradition\nThus, they've maintained the same rituals over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to remain anchored in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to be flexible to change\nIndeed\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly attendance at Mass\nAnd\nThey're stringent about maintaining certain protocols\nAdditionally\nThere's a perception that the Catholic Church exhibits a certain attitude towards those who deviate from the doctrine\nEven\nIt seems that they're not receptive to individuals who aren't fully aligned with the Catholic faith\nMoreover\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith union was declined by the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian background\nClearly\nThis isn't a demonstration of tolerance towards other religions\nDespite being taught to love others, the Catholic Church's practice often contradicts this principle\nIn essence, the doctrine instructs one to love and accept all, yet the Church's behavior suggests otherwise\nIt's as if the Church is wedded to outdated practices which they continue to uphold\n\nI don't believe this situation would significantly impact the issue\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to marry might be a positive step\nBut\nI don't anticipate it would prevent pedophilic behavior\nAs\nIt lies in a different sphere\nMoreover\nIndividuals who commit such acts would likely continue to do so irrespective of their marital status\nSince the target isn't a spouse but a child\nIt appears that such acts would transpire regardless of marriage status\nTherefore, I don't think permitting priests to marry would mitigate these issues",
            "I'm still deliberating on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I must admit, I'm torn. On one hand, it's a highly sensitive topic, balancing on the precipice of church and state. Defining marriage, especially when it comes to same-sex unions, is a thorny endeavor, as it involves navigating complex social and legal landscapes.\n\nI believe that, in terms of government recognition, civil unions are the way to go. If two people choose to unite, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or cultural context? After all, people who are baptized or belong to certain religions don't receive special government treatment based on that alone. Therefore, I think the government should approach the matter with a neutral stance, recognizing the union for what it is.\n\nIf all states can agree on a logical course of action, then I believe a federal law should be implemented. However, I firmly believe that amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach. This would be a disproportionate response to a complex social issue. It's not that I don't believe in the importance of the issue, but I don't believe it's significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't support amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It's not the right approach to address this matter.",
            "Growing up in a religious household, the subject of homosexuality has been a complex and intriguing topic for me. While I have a plethora of friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I must admit that I have reservations about their lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the legalization of same-sex relations and advocate for a state-by-state decision process rather than a federal one. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its stance on the matter, as policies should reflect the values and beliefs of the people who live there. Furthermore, I find it problematic when a national figure, such as the president, attempts to impose their views on the entire country. After all, they do not reside in every state, and their policies should not supersede the collective will of the people living in their respective communities. Therefore, I stand in favor of leaving these decisions in the hands of the individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately bear the consequences of their choices.",
            "Well, to begin with, I don't think it's accurate to assert that MySpace is a private platform. According to the definition, it's a bulletin board meant for public consumption. When we put something online, we should expect various individuals, including educators, to view it. It's a public sphere, and while I understand the concern about privacy, if the information is accessible to the public, it's not a violation per se. However, if the intent is purely to monitor students' activities to maintain a safer environment, that's a different story.\n\nConsider, for instance, if a student posts about their involvement in harmful activities. If the school officials witness this and it aids in preventing a tragedy, like a school shooting, can we really call that an invasion of privacy? It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's acceptable to use public platforms for this purpose when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of students.\n\nI must admit, I've often hesitated to express myself freely online, even through electronic communication. I'm not particularly eager to share anything that could potentially be used against me later. The digital trail we leave behind can come back to haunt us. I've had experiences where I've refrained from sharing even mundane facts about others due to fear of misinterpretation. It's a constant vigilance, and I believe it's a prudent practice, especially for students who might not understand the full implications of their online actions.\n\nBut, returning to the topic at hand, if the information accessed is used to enhance the safety of the school environment, it's not an invasion. It's more about the integrity and responsibility of the school system to ensure a safe space for its students. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe and secure environment when they entrust them to the system.\n\nFurthermore, schools have been proactive in preparing for various threats, including school shootings. Lockdown drills, security protocols, and surveillance are all measures taken to safeguard students. In this context, if school officials are using available information to maintain this safe environment, I wouldn't consider it an invasion of privacy. Instead, it's a responsibility they've undertaken to ensure the well-being of their students.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I understand the concern about privacy, I believe the balance tips towards the responsibility and the necessity of the school system to ensure the safety of its students, especially in the context of a potentially dangerous situation like a school shooting.",
            "In the aftermath of the devastating events of September 11th, I was initially swayed by a strong desire for retribution. The sentiment was understandable, as the attacks hit close to home. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea of invading and causing as much upheaval as the terrorists had done here. However, with hindsight, it's clear that we overlooked many critical factors and acted impulsively, without a well-thought-out plan. The decision to go to war was emotionally driven and lacked a clear strategy. We entered the conflict underprepared, unaware of what we would face and the unique nature of warfare in that region. The mindset was largely one of vengeance, rather than rational consideration of long-term consequences or cultural differences.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, to some extent, a response to public sentiment. However, it appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a carefully considered policy. The lack of a clear plan for what to do once in Iraq only exacerbated the situation. The absence of a cohesive strategy and unity of purpose among our forces made it challenging to establish order. It is my belief that we were more driven by anger and revenge than by a genuine desire to improve the lives of the people in Iraq.\n\nMoreover, I have come to question the effectiveness of our involvement in the region. The constant conflict has been more harmful than helpful. The people of Iraq seem to be more focused on their internal struggles than on improving their country, and our presence there has not significantly altered this dynamic. I believe that our continued engagement in the area is more likely to exacerbate the problems than to resolve them. Ultimately, I feel that we should step back and allow the region to find its own path, rather than attempting to impose our will from the outside.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice was understandable, the execution of our military efforts was flawed. We acted impulsively and failed to consider the long-term implications and cultural differences. The ongoing conflict has not produced the desired results, and I believe that our withdrawal is the best course of action."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church requires reform. I have noted that its membership is declining, and I believe this is due to its sometimes stringent stance on various issues. For instance, its position on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as outdated or unyielding. While it's acceptable to have strong convictions, the Church's views on these topics may be alienating to some. I've heard that many people are withdrawing from the Church, disagreeing with their stances on these subjects. For example, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that opposes these beliefs. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married clergy, but I'm unsure if these changes would have prevented the recent issues. Perhaps the Church's dogmatic nature is more to blame. The Church claims its priests are married to God, but I see no reason why they can't also have personal relationships.",
            "I must preface this by saying that I'm not inherently against same-sex marriage. It's not a topic I've extensively examined, but I do have some thoughts on it. I believe that sexual orientation is not something that can be chosen, and thus, individuals should not be held accountable for their orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can marry, while two people of the same sex cannot. It just seems unfair and illogical to me. I think it's more of a personal choice than a societal one, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in it. It's not a security threat, and it's not something that should be disciplined. People should be able to live their lives as they choose, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't think it's the federal government's place to interfere with that.",
            "In regards to the normalization of same-sex unions, I firmly believe that the current legal landscape is not only outdated but also discriminatory. Fundamental arguments against it often hinge on the notion that such relationships pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family, yet this oversimplifies the complex nature of human relationships. Heterosexual and homosexual partnerships, despite their differences, share a multitude of commonalities that render them interchangeable in most practical aspects.\n\nFor instance, the civil and legal rights granted to married couples are extensive, encompassing property taxes and healthcare provisions, among others. The exclusion of same-sex couples from these benefits is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Furthermore, studies have shown that the success rates of homosexual unions are on par with those of their heterosexual counterparts, with similar factors contributing to relational satisfaction.\n\nThe primary contention often lies in the conflation of religious and secular realms. Advocates for same-sex marriage are not seeking religious sanction but rather a civil union recognized by the government. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, should be upheld and respected in this context.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of gay couples on the community and the potential influence on children are often overstated. Research indicates that children of gay parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples, with no significant differences in emotional or social development. The key determinant is not sexual orientation but rather the quality of parenting.\n\nUltimately, I argue for federal legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide. The current patchwork of state laws is inefficient and discriminatory. The federal government should take a leadership role in this matter, rather than leaving it to individual states to decide. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that any legislation must be informed by evidence-based research and not merely religious or cultural biases.\n\nPresident Bush's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in his religious beliefs, which is understandable. However, it is problematic when these beliefs are translated into public policy, particularly given the federal government's historical stance on religious neutrality. The recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance, for example, illustrates the sensitivity around religious symbols in public life.\n\nLastly, it is essential to dispel the misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. The notion that it is a result of psychological trauma or personality defects has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The American Psychological Association, among other authoritative institutions, has refuted such claims. It is imperative that public discourse on this topic is informed by empirical evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural biases.",
            "In the course of my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a recurring theme that often confounds me: the stigma surrounding certain substances. While it's true that the illegality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its lack of potential benefits, I must assert that my stance is nuanced. I affirm that while the public consumption of these substances should be restricted, their medicinal use should be considered.\n\nTo elucidate, consider the controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, which are widely used in medical settings despite their legality. These substances are not without their perils, but their benefits are undeniable. Marijuana, in my opinion, possesses similar potential. However, the public perception of marijuana as a harmful substance detracts from its responsible use.\n\nI propose a gradual legalization process, beginning with the elimination of the stigma associated with marijuana. This could be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. By doing so, I believe we can foster an environment where marijuana is used responsibly, both medically and recreationally.",
            "Well, over the years, the church has certainly evolved to better reflect the spirit of the twenty-first century. It's no longer as stringent as it once was. As a child, my Sundays were filled with church attendance, complete with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. I even attended a private school where many of my friends frequented the church on weekends. However, as I've grown older, the church has made notable adaptations. For instance, they've introduced a youth service that's only thirty minutes long, and the attire has become significantly more casual. Even in the morning masses, I now see people in jeans and khakis, a stark contrast to the more formal attire of the past. The church I know has indeed undergone these changes, but I'm not privy to the internal politics or the intricacies of its leadership. That's the extent of my observations.\n\nRegarding your questions about the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe that these incidents couldn't have been entirely prevented by the church simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. The root of the problem lies within the individual, not the institution. Some married individuals struggle with pedophilia, and their marital status doesn't alter their predispositions. If a person is predisposed to such behavior, they may seek it out regardless of marital status. The choice to become a priest is a personal one, and if someone feels called to the priesthood despite wanting to marry, they might consider a different faith that permits it, like Seventh Heaven, where ministers and reverends can marry.\n\nTo further clarify, I believe that sexual attraction, including pedophilia, is largely genetic. I don't think it's something that can be entirely influenced by upbringing or societal changes. Marriage, while it can provide a support system, doesn't change someone's genetic makeup. Therefore, I don't believe the church could have prevented these incidents through societal changes alone. If the church was aware of these cases and endeavored to cover them up, that would indeed be despicable, but I suspect that in many cases, the church may not have been aware of these incidents.",
            "In the wake of the September 11th events, I initially found the initial premise acceptable. However, I soon realized that the collective shock and grief made it easy for the Iraq War to be framed as a response to Osama Bin Laden and the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These claims were later debunked, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. The Bush administration's handling of the situation has always been a source of frustration for me, as the administration's lies about the justification for war have never been adequately addressed, even by those who were directly involved.\n\nI find it particularly galling that Colin Powell, who once presented the case for war with such conviction, now admits he was not persuaded by the evidence at the time. This, to me, is a clear example of malfeasance in office, approaching an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is not just an issue of the past; it has been ongoing since 9/11, with a clear intent to expand our energy supply and settle old scores, specifically with Saddam Hussein.\n\nWithdrawing from Iraq now could potentially lead to a civil war, with more lives lost. The proposed alternative—an intervention by neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also does not inspire confidence. The long-term stability of Iraq's sovereignty is uncertain, with the interim government's effectiveness questionable and radical elements vying for control.",
            "Hmm, let's see. What's this about? Oh, the war in Iraq. Okay. Well, it's like, I don't know much about it, really. It feels, I mean, it started as a response to something, right? Like, the attacks on September 11th. But now, I'm not sure it's making much sense. It's like, we're trying to build democracy there, which takes time, and we're doing it for our own interests too, like oil. It's just, it's not helping matters much. And if we stay, we'll be stuck there forever, trying to keep the peace, and if we leave, it'll be like we abandoned them. It's a tough situation. I don't know, it's hard to say if it's worth it. It's like, we're not at war with them, really. It's just a bunch of soldiers stationed there. It's like, we're showing off our power, but it's not a real war. And it shouldn't be called one. But, I don't know, I'm not sure if I should want it to end. It's just, it's complicated. It's like we're interfering in their culture and making things worse. It's like, we're trying to change them into something they're not. And it's going to end up causing more problems. I mean, there's so much going on there. It's like, it's a mess.

            "I’m hesitant to endorse the notion of making it legally binding or for a state to even recognize its legitimacy. I firmly believe that the decision should rest with the religious institutions, as the Constitution explicitly advocates for the separation of church and state. The guidelines are crystal clear, and any attempt to impose regulations or exert control over this issue would be a direct contradiction of the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Consequently, I maintain that the decision to legalize or ban this practice should not be imposed by the government but rather left to the discretion of religious bodies.\n\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that those advocating for its illegality are prioritizing one religious belief over others, as historical records indicate that the majority of Christians, particularly Catholics, are opposed to this practice. It is my perspective that the government should not impose its will on matters of faith and belief, as the Constitution promotes religious tolerance and freedom. Furthermore, I am skeptical about the proposed amendment, as I believe it would be a rare instance where the government seeks to restrict the people rather than itself.\n\nMy stance is that neither the federal government nor any other authority should intervene in this matter. The push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader societal or economic concerns. I do not foresee any significant impact on the economy or society as a result of this practice, and I believe that it could potentially have a positive effect on societal well-being. In essence, I maintain that the final decision should be left to the churches, and I do not see any compelling reasons to alter the current legal status through an amendment.",
            "In the realm of historical context, the war in Iraq is a topic that has long been a subject of scrutiny and debate. To commence, I firmly believe that the authorities did not provide the populace with a candid account of the reasons behind the decision to invade Iraq. The association drawn between the war and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's indignation to rally support for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI, myself, am staunchly opposed to military intervention, particularly when it involves preventive strikes. The conflict in Iraq, however, is a stark reminder of the Vietnam War's echoes. The American government's failure to adequately prepare for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued following the removal of the Iraqi government is a glaring oversight. The government's inability to anticipate the vacuum of power and the subsequent insurgency is a poignant lesson not learned from the past.\n\nThe efforts to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of similar attempts in Vietnam, have proven to be a lengthy and arduous process. The US government's portrayal of a swift, successful campaign was, in hindsight, naive. Building a functional democracy takes time, as our own history attests, and the government's optimism about the ease of this endeavor was misplaced.\n\nThe decision to engage in war is a complex one, and the 2004 presidential election was a pivotal moment in my political awakening. I found myself grappling with the decision to support George W. Bush's continuation of the Iraq occupation. The responsibility to honor the sacrifices made and the lives lost is a heavy one, but so too is the responsibility to weigh the cost in human lives against the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. The question of whether our intervention was motivated by altruism or strategic interests, particularly concerns over oil resources, is one that has fueled ongoing debate.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a reminder of the intricacies of foreign policy and the challenges of nation-building. Despite the best intentions, the ultimate outcome often depends on factors beyond our control. It is my sincere hope that the conflict will conclude soon, and that peace will prevail in the region, though I remain skeptical of such a swift resolution.",
            "I've always held the belief in the rightness of same-sex unions. It's a deeply personal choice, one that many now recognize as potentially having biological underpinnings rather than being solely influenced by societal norms. It seems inequitable to me that individuals might face reduced rights based on something largely beyond their control. I find it disheartening to think that people could be denied the same rights and opportunities due to their orientation. I've long been an advocate for full acceptance and equality in this regard.\n\nPolitics and government often interject themselves where they shouldn't. This is a matter of personal and household concern, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples, functioning just as any other family would, despite not being officially married due to legal restrictions. It's these everyday, ordinary examples that underscore the need for change.\n\nThe notion of interpreting the sacred institution of marriage through a political lens can be seen as an overreach. I've seen compelling evidence suggesting that sexual orientation might have biological roots, as opposed to being shaped solely by environment and upbringing. This perspective challenges the notion that such unions are any less valid or natural. It's akin to saying that individuals predisposed to heterosexuality should be denied marriage if they were raised in a single-parent household with multiple sisters, for instance.\n\nMoreover, the double standard seems glaring. Heterosexual couples can elope, marriage licenses aside, while same-sex couples often face public scrutiny and media attention. Marital choices, in my view, should be private affairs, not public spectacles.",
            "Posting something on the internet is akin to sharing it with the entire world. It's public, plain and simple. As a Resident Assistant, I've faced this issue firsthand. When you place something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you discuss volatile topics such as violence, you can't escape scrutiny. The internet, after all, is accessible to everyone. If a friend on Myspace sees something concerning, they might inform the school. They can't ignore such information, as they must prevent potential dangers. However, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes, people jest about such topics, and it might just be a misunderstanding. In our school, an incident occurred where someone misinterpreted a post as a threat. The person in question had intended it as a joke, but the situation escalated due to the context. It's essential to remember that the internet is a public space. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your posts. However, if school officials are made aware of a potential threat through legitimate means, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't, however, snoop through students' social media accounts under false pretenses. If a student brings it to their attention, it falls under a different category. In conclusion, while the internet is a public forum, it's crucial to be mindful of what you post and who you share it with.",
            "The conflict has stretched on interminably, and I find it hard to discern the original intent. Initially, it seemed the goal was to instill democratic principles in a nation, but over time, that objective appears to have been lost sight of. It seems we are now engaged in this endeavor more for the sake of global dominance than for any clear political purpose. I believe the initial motivations were questionable, possibly influenced by personal connections between the current and previous administrations. If the purpose was to introduce democracy into a system lacking it, that was a noble aim. However, if personal concerns played a part, then I question the fairness of the cause. I believe our objective was made clear within the first few months of the conflict, yet it has persisted for years.\n\nI maintain that the war's duration has reached a point where it is no longer serving its initial purpose. It feels as if we are engaged in this for the sake of engaging in it, and we are reluctant to end it without a clear victory. I believe it is time to reconsider our involvement, as the local government is now capable of managing its affairs independently. Moreover, our economy is bearing the brunt of this conflict, as we invest billions in a war while our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure, remain unaddressed. It seems our resources would be better spent on our own citizens' well-being rather than sustaining a war that has lost its focus. The immense financial investment in this conflict is a drain on our economy and should be redirected towards more pressing domestic needs.\n\nI believe it is time to reassess our involvement and prioritize our own internal projects and improvements.",
            "Regarding your recent inquiry, I'd like to pose a question to clarify the situation. It seems that a certain event was averted due to someone's online activity. Notably, on platforms like Myspace, one's information is publicly accessible, much like a storefront. To access someone's profile, one typically needs to be their \"friend,\" thereby granting permission for that person to view their profile. However, I acknowledge that sharing information online inherently invites scrutiny.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain how one would effectively monitor all students' online activities. While it's understandable that schools might want to ensure students' safety, it's crucial to consider the potential for bias and invasion. If a school were to assign someone to monitor profiles, it could potentially lead to targeted surveillance. This raises ethical concerns, as it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI, for one, maintain a Facebook account, though I'm conscious that it's a double-edged sword. There are certainly unsavory individuals who can exploit this information for nefarious purposes. A television program I watched highlighted a man who managed to find a girl's screen name and engage with her within minutes, ultimately arranging a meeting. Personally, I wouldn't meet someone I don't know, but I've had classmates who recognize me, despite not knowing my screen name. This raises concerns about privacy, as they can piece together information about my life.\n\nBalancing the benefits of social media with the risks is tricky. I only accept friend requests from acquaintances, but it's impossible to know who might be looking at one's profile. My roommate mentioned that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed quite restrictive. I question the school's authority to impose such a restriction.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns, I believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and safety.",
            "Indeed,\nI find myself compelled to discuss the Iraq War one more time, though I must admit, I hesitate as it's a topic that often feels insincere when addressed.\nYou see, I was opposed from the outset, yet it's wiser not to dwell on sentiments that no longer matter.\nIt's evident that the majority of the world, including the Iraqis themselves, view the war negatively, with upwards of eighty percent supporting a swift withdrawal.\nThe troops stationed there, too, share this sentiment, with a significant portion believing a departure within the year is necessary.\nThe situation is, and has been, a catastrophe from the moment we entered, and it's clear our presence has only exacerbated this.\nThe Middle East's cultural differences pose a formidable obstacle to our attempts to impose Western ideals.\nSaddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrant, but the cost of intervention was not justified, given the potential for chaos and instability.\nMy perspective is that we should exit immediately, and though I understand the administration may have reasons for extending our stay, I remain unconvinced.\nThe Iraqis themselves, who we claim to be helping, have expressed desires for our departure, and listening to them should be our priority.\nIf they request our withdrawal, it would remove us from the equation should the situation deteriorate further.\nAfter all, while we may never be seen as saviors in the region, at least we would have acted on the will of those we claim to support.",
            "It is evident that gender discrimination persists in the United States, albeit in various forms. While not exclusively targeting women, certain occupations may still harbor biases. For instance, the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women encounter barriers to advancement despite equal qualifications, remains a challenge. This is partly due to societal perceptions that women are less suited for upper-management roles.\n\nMoreover, roles that were historically male-dominated, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face societal disapproval. Conversely, men in fields like fashion may face skepticism due to societal perceptions of their gender and lifestyle. Change, though gradual, is underway as more women secure executive positions and gain acceptance in the business world. Similarly, the acceptance of male stay-at-home parents is growing.\n\nAddressing these issues involves promoting the unique qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than forcefully pushing for change. This approach respects the pace of societal evolution and acknowledges the progress already made. Additionally, barriers due to regional backgrounds and educational levels also exist. For instance, a CEO with a rural upbringing might face discrimination due to less-than-perfect grammar. These examples illustrate the complex nature of discrimination and the need for ongoing efforts to combat it.",
            "The understanding is that it hasn't been legalized, but rather, decriminalized. This shift reduces the severity of the offense from a criminal one to something more akin to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic ticket. For instance, instead of being arrested and processed through the legal system, individuals are simply cited. This change doesn't eliminate the potential future impacts, such as those on employment prospects, but it does reduce the immediate legal consequences and associated costs. The cost of law enforcement and court proceedings is substantial, particularly for financially struggling municipalities. Therefore, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana. However, in places like Denver, where the social and political climate is more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as a viable option. This can free up resources for community services, such as education, social programs for the elderly, and aid for the homeless. It's important to strike a balance; while marijuana should not be prevalent everywhere, its decriminalization can have financial benefits. However, it's crucial to consider the societal implications, such as the acceptability of openly smoking marijuana and the potential impact on driving safety. Both alcohol and marijuana can affect individuals differently, with each substance having its own set of potential negative effects. No two people react the same to substances, and personal moderation is key. Despite the differences in individual reactions, both substances have their own adverse effects. The general consensus is that they both should be approached with caution.",
            "I would lean towards affirming the notion\nGiven that\nMany of their practices are steeped in tradition\nThus, they've maintained the same rituals over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to remain anchored in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to be flexible to change\nIndeed\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly attendance at Mass\nAnd\nThey're stringent about maintaining certain protocols\nAdditionally\nThere's a perception that the Catholic Church exhibits a certain attitude towards those who deviate from the doctrine\nEven\nIt seems that they're not receptive to individuals who aren't fully aligned with the Catholic faith\nMoreover\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith union was declined by the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian background\nClearly\nThis isn't a demonstration of tolerance towards other religions\nDespite being taught to love others, the Catholic Church's practice often contradicts this principle\nIn essence, the doctrine instructs one to love and accept all, yet the Church's behavior suggests otherwise\nIt's as if the Church is wedded to outdated practices which they continue to uphold\n\nI don't believe this situation would significantly impact the issue\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to marry might be a positive step\nBut\nI don't anticipate it would prevent pedophilic behavior\nAs\nIt lies in a different sphere\nMoreover\nIndividuals who commit such acts would likely continue to do so irrespective of their marital status\nSince the target isn't a spouse but a child\nIt appears that such acts would transpire regardless of marriage status\nTherefore, I don't think permitting priests to marry would mitigate these issues",
            "I'm still deliberating on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I must admit, I'm torn. On one hand, it's a highly sensitive topic, balancing on the precipice of church and state. Defining marriage, especially when it comes to same-sex unions, is a thorny endeavor, as it involves navigating complex social and legal landscapes.\n\nI believe that, in terms of government recognition, civil unions are the way to go. If two people choose to unite, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or cultural context? After all, people who are baptized or belong to certain religions don't receive special government treatment based on that alone. Therefore, I think the government should approach the matter with a neutral stance, recognizing the union for what it is.\n\nIf all states can agree on a logical course of action, then I believe a federal law should be implemented. However, I firmly believe that amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach. This would be a disproportionate response to a complex social issue. It's not that I don't believe in the importance of the issue, but I don't believe it's significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't support amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It's not the right approach to address this matter.",
            "Growing up in a religious household, the subject of homosexuality has been a complex and intriguing topic for me. While I have a plethora of friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I must admit that I have reservations about their lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the legalization of same-sex relations and advocate for a state-by-state decision process rather than a federal one. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its stance on the matter, as policies should reflect the values and beliefs of the people who live there. Furthermore, I find it problematic when a national figure, such as the president, attempts to impose their views on the entire country. After all, they do not reside in every state, and their policies should not supersede the collective will of the people living in their respective communities. Therefore, I stand in favor of leaving these decisions in the hands of the individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately bear the consequences of their choices.",
            "Well, to begin with, I don't think it's accurate to assert that MySpace is a private platform. According to the definition, it's a bulletin board meant for public consumption. When we put something online, we should expect various individuals, including educators, to view it. It's a public sphere, and while I understand the concern about privacy, if the information is accessible to the public, it's not a violation per se. However, if the intent is purely to monitor students' activities to maintain a safer environment, that's a different story.\n\nConsider, for instance, if a student posts about their involvement in harmful activities. If the school officials witness this and it aids in preventing a tragedy, like a school shooting, can we really call that an invasion of privacy? It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's acceptable to use public platforms for this purpose when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of students.\n\nI must admit, I've often hesitated to express myself freely online, even through electronic communication. I'm not particularly eager to share anything that could potentially be used against me later. The digital trail we leave behind can come back to haunt us. I've had experiences where I've refrained from sharing even mundane facts about others due to fear of misinterpretation. It's a constant vigilance, and I believe it's a prudent practice, especially for students who might not understand the full implications of their online actions.\n\nBut, returning to the topic at hand, if the information accessed is used to enhance the safety of the school environment, it's not an invasion. It's more about the integrity and responsibility of the school system to ensure a safe space for its students. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe and secure environment when they entrust them to the system.\n\nFurthermore, schools have been proactive in preparing for various threats, including school shootings. Lockdown drills, security protocols, and surveillance are all measures taken to safeguard students. In this context, if school officials are using available information to maintain this safe environment, I wouldn't consider it an invasion of privacy. Instead, it's a responsibility they've undertaken to ensure the well-being of their students.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I understand the concern about privacy, I believe the balance tips towards the responsibility and the necessity of the school system to ensure the safety of its students, especially in the context of a potentially dangerous situation like a school shooting.",
            "In the aftermath of the devastating events of September 11th, I was initially swayed by a strong desire for retribution. The sentiment was understandable, as the attacks hit close to home. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea of invading and causing as much upheaval as the terrorists had done here. However, with hindsight, it's clear that we overlooked many critical factors and acted impulsively, without a well-thought-out plan. The decision to go to war was emotionally driven and lacked a clear strategy. We entered the conflict underprepared, unaware of what we would face and the unique nature of warfare in that region. The mindset was largely one of vengeance, rather than rational consideration of long-term consequences or cultural differences.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, to some extent, a response to public sentiment. However, it appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a carefully considered policy. The lack of a clear plan for what to do once in Iraq only exacerbated the situation. The absence of a cohesive strategy and unity of purpose among our forces made it challenging to establish order. It is my belief that we were more driven by anger and revenge than by a genuine desire to improve the lives of the people in Iraq.\n\nMoreover, I have come to question the effectiveness of our involvement in the region. The constant conflict has been more harmful than helpful. The people of Iraq seem to be more focused on their internal struggles than on improving their country, and our presence there has not significantly altered this dynamic. I believe that our continued engagement in the area is more likely to exacerbate the problems than to resolve them. Ultimately, I feel that we should step back and allow the region to find its own path, rather than attempting to impose our will from the outside.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice was understandable, the execution of our military efforts was flawed. We acted impulsively and failed to consider the long-term implications and cultural differences. The ongoing conflict has not produced the desired results, and I believe that our withdrawal is the best course of action."
