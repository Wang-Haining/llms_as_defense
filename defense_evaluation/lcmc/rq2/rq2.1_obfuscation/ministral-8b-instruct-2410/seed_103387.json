            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve. The institution has been grappling with a dwindling number of adherents, and I believe this is largely due to its stringent stances on various social issues. For instance, the Church's position on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception tends to be conservative, which can alienate those who hold opposing views. While these views are deeply ingrained, they may be perceived as outdated. A slight adjustment towards more modern perspectives could potentially mitigate this decline in support. There's a growing segment of the population that's drifting away from the Church due to its viewpoints on these subjects. For example, someone who supports abortion or same-sex marriage may struggle to reconcile these beliefs with the Church's teachings. I am of the opinion that there is no inherent reason why the Church cannot allow female priests or permit priests to marry. While these changes might not have prevented past incidents, they could represent a shift towards a more inclusive and flexible institution. The Church's current policy of requiring celibacy for priests, which it views as a spiritual commitment to God, could, in my opinion, be re-evaluated. Many professionals balance their work with family life and other relationships, so why shouldn't priests be allowed to do the same? However, it's challenging to predict whether such changes would fundamentally alter the Church's behavior in significant ways.",
            "Well, um, I'm not adverse to the idea of same-sex marriage. I mean, I believe that individuals are born with their sexual orientation and I don't think it's something one can necessarily choose. Consequently, I don't believe that gay individuals should be held accountable for their orientation. I find it rather inequitable that a man and a woman can wed, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't really delved deeply into this topic, but I would certainly argue that it's unjust to restrict gay couples from marriage. It's not like they have a choice in their orientation; it's an inherent aspect of their being. I don't believe the federal government should be invested in this matter, as it's not a matter of national security or morals. The government should not interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to who they love. It's simply who they are and they shouldn't be penalized for that. That's my perspective on the matter.",
            "I contend that same-sex marriage ought to be legally recognized. The reasons against it, however, are not compelling. Many argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this perspective is flawed due to the diversity and complexity of relationships. This is akin to viewing heads and tails as distinct entities, even though they are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, numerous civil rights, including property tax benefits and healthcare considerations, are at stake. For instance, the partner of a gay individual may not be permitted to visit in the event of illness, as they are not technically considered family. This seems arbitrary given the commitment such couples share. Scientific research, notably the high rates of relationship satisfaction among homosexual couples, contradicts this notion. Fundamentally, they are requesting a legal document rather than a religious ceremony. Legally recognizing these unions would not breach church-state separation, as it would not involve religious officiation. Segregation and inequality are reminiscent of past policies, and legislation against same-sex marriage is a new form of this. Children of gay couples are often the focus of concern, but studies suggest that parental orientation does not significantly impact their adjustment. Ultimately, the federal government should intervene to legalize same-sex marriage in every state. However, President Bush's stance is grounded in his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. This perspective, while valid, should not dictate national law. Morality, after all, varies greatly among individuals and cultural groups. To impose one group's morality on the entire nation is unethical. Some oppose same-sex marriage due to psychological misconceptions about homosexuality, a notion debunked by the American Psychological Association. Education on these issues is crucial, as it often refutes popular misconceptions and promotes acceptance.",
            "In the course of employment at a hospital pharmacy during the summer months, certain observations regarding illegal drugs have become evident. The mere fact that a substance is deemed unlawful does not inherently negate its potential therapeutic value. Consequently, while I would not advocate for unrestricted public access to such compounds, I do recognize that, in certain contexts, their medicinal properties may be harnessed. For instance, drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which fall under controlled substances, are routinely used in clinical settings due to their beneficial effects. Therefore, to arbitrarily deny similar advantages from other substances, such as marijuana, solely based on societal stigmas appears shortsighted.\n\nMoreover, I contend that a gradual, controlled legalization of marijuana, rather than an abrupt decriminalization, could mitigate potential misuse. By first addressing the cultural taboo surrounding cannabis and promoting responsible use, society could transition more responsibly. The stigma associated with marijuana, often erroneously paralleled to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine, must be dismantled to foster a more pragmatic approach to its potential benefits, particularly in medical applications.",
            "The church has undoubtedly evolved with the times, adapting to the 21st century. The rigidness that once characterized it has significantly diminished. Growing up, I frequently attended church every Sunday, often donning cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. My religious education was a fundamental aspect of my life, and I enjoyed the structured social environment. However, as I've grown older, the church has introduced more contemporary aspects, such as a teenager-friendly mass that's been shortened to thirty minutes and a more casual dress code, particularly during summer. Families often join late, and it's not uncommon to see beach attire. Even morning masses, typically a time for more formal attire, now feature jeans and khakis. The change in the church's atmosphere and dress code is quite noticeable.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Men who become pedophiles are not necessarily deterred by marital status; their attractions are often rooted in genetics. I suspect that these issues are primarily a matter of individual predisposition and not necessarily a result of marital restrictions or lack thereof. If priests are genuinely driven to practice their faith and marry, perhaps they should consider denominations that permit both.\n\nIn my view, the tendency towards pedophilia in some men might be more about inherent genetics than upbringing. Marriage is not a shield against such tendencies, as they often manifest regardless. If the church becomes aware of these issues and attempts to cover them up, that's highly regrettable. However, I doubt that all cases involved knowledge or cover-ups from the church's leadership. My thoughts on the Catholic Church are limited to these observations and don't extend to other aspects of its teachings or practices.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially found the Iraq War's foundation to be tenuous, an opinion amplified by the lingering shock of the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein's regime to Al-Qaeda and the alleged weapons of mass destruction was tenuous and has since been debunked. This misinformation, coupled with the administration's disregard for public interest, has left a sour taste in my mouth. The Iraq War has become a contentious issue, exacerbated by the Bush administration's persistent deceit and constitutional contempt.\n\nColin Powell's recent admissions about his UN presentation underscore this. The administration's willingness to mislead the public, a clear breach of office integrity, has set a precedent of malfeasance. The younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's past, and his interest in securing energy resources, further underscores the war's underhanded origins.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the potential chaos that could ensue from an immediate withdrawal, the current coalition of nations proposed by the UN and USA seems no less fraught. Iraq's political landscape is riddled with disunity and radical factions. The interim government's weakness is evident, with the Prime Minister's control tenuous and key political players like Moqtada al-Sadr gaining significant influence. This political friction, coupled with the sovereignty issue, suggests a precarious situation that may not be easily resolved.\n\nIn polite circles, I refrain from expressing these thoughts, but in an unguarded moment, it's clear that the Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue that has left a lasting impact on the nation and the world.",
            "Oh, alright, let's just dive into this discussion. You want me to share my views on the War in Iraq? Sure thing.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'm not really one to keep up with the finer details of current events. I mean, I know the basics, like the fact that it wasn't exactly a declared war. It felt more like we were just trying to \"even the score\" after 9/11, aiming our sights at Iraq because we suspected they had a hand in those attacks.\n\nI just don't feel strongly about it, you know? I don't really follow the ins and outs. But what I do know is that we've been there for a while, trying to build some sort of democracy. I'm not sure if that's the best use of our resources, though. We've been there so long, and it's causing a lot of unrest, both in Iraq and here at home.\n\nI mean, look at the Vietnam War. It wasn't declared by Congress either, and it's become known as a meaningless conflict. And now, if we leave Iraq, it's going to look like George W. Bush started a pointless war, and that's going to be his legacy. It's not a good look.\n\nBut then again, there are families affected. Sons and daughters over there, fighting in a war that's causing more division and strife. Shouldn't we be helping them? Shouldn't we be trying to make things better for them?\n\nBut at the same time, we're trying to impose our culture and values on a country that has been under a totalitarian system for so long. It's like we're trying to turn them into a second United States, and that could just fuel more hatred towards us. Think about it, Al-Qaeda and all that.\n\nSo, I don't know. It's a tough situation. I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.",
            "Certainly, I must express my reservations about the proposal to legally or statutorily declare it as such. I believe that the decision should rest with the churches, as enshrined in the Constitution's provision for the separation of church and state. It is unequivocally stated, and I maintain that any attempt to exert control over it would be an affront to the established principles. Those advocating for its illegality appear to be favoring one denomination's beliefs over others, as the majority of Catholic and Christian communities are opposed to it, save for a few isolated instances. I contend that the government should not dictate what the churches can or cannot legalize, as this goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in the United States. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, and amending this to restrict it would be counterintuitive and potentially restrictive of individual freedoms. Such an amendment would be unprecedented in its focus on curbing personal liberties rather than government power. Furthermore, I see no compelling reason for the federal government to meddle in this matter, as the president's push seems driven more by his personal beliefs as a Catholic than any broader societal benefits. This is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government, and I fail to see how an amendment, backed only by personal convictions, would have any positive impact. In essence, I believe the churches should decide this issue, not the government or any constituent of it.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nIndeed, the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion was shrouded in ambiguity regarding the government's motives. The notion that the Iraq War was directly linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11th was largely speculative, with the administration manipulating public sentiment to justify military action. The invasion began in 2003, following a period of heightened national outrage over the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn my personal stance, I am staunchly opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in my view, echoes the Vietnam War in its execution and the subsequent aftermath. The loss of numerous American lives is a stark reminder of the gravity of this decision.\n\nThe US government's preparedness for the post-invasion vacuum of power and the resultant chaos was woefully inadequate. The initial plan was to establish a democratic government, similar to the efforts in Vietnam, but the expectation of swift success was naive. The reality was a prolonged, complex struggle with a significant civilian populace resistant to foreign intervention.\n\nThe government's failure to anticipate the prolonged nature of the conflict, coupled with the sheer volume of American casualties, highlights a clear lack of thorough planning. The ongoing training of Iraqi troops and police forces to stabilize the nation underscores the magnitude of the task. The US government's reliance on oil resources and geopolitical interests further clouds the true intentions behind the invasion.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq remains a contentious one, with the 2004 presidential election serving as a focal point for my deliberations. While the sentiment to see the mission through is strong, the fiscal and human cost is also a critical consideration. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the disparity in response to similar threats in other nations, such as North Korea, calls into question the US government's transparency and the underlying reasons for military action.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and divisive issue. The hope for a swift resolution remains, but the reality is a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight.",

            "The digital age has transformed communication, and with it, the implications of what we share online. Once a piece of information is posted on the internet, it becomes a public record, accessible to anyone and everyone. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've had firsthand experience with this very concept. What you post can color how others perceive you, and in extreme cases, it might even lead to serious consequences.\n\nImagine, for instance, if you share content about violent acts or threats. It's crucial to understand that this information can reach authorities, who would then be obligated to investigate due to the potential danger. It's a delicate balance, as not all internet content is indicative of genuine intent. Some individuals might post seemingly innocuous statements that could, in certain contexts, be taken seriously.\n\nIn my school, we've faced situations where overheard comments led to school officials investigating. While it's important to respect privacy, it's also essential to recognize that sharing potentially harmful information circumvents that right. If content is brought to the attention of school officials, they must take it seriously to ensure the safety of the community.\n\nI must stress, though, that I'm not advocating for school officials to monitor private communications like Facebook, Myspace, or even Xanga. Such intrusions are not appropriate. However, when information is shared openly and becomes a matter of public concern, it's a different story. If students are friends with their teachers on these platforms, and a teacher isn't acting deceptively, then any shared information should be taken seriously.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an RA, I wouldn't befriend residents on social media. I prefer to maintain a professional boundary, and I certainly wouldn't want to see personal content that might be inappropriate. However, if concerns arise, I'm duty-bound to address them appropriately, ensuring the safety and well-being of the students under my care.",

The war has become a prolonged display of power, with potential personal agendas from previous political entanglements clouding the initial, noble intent. The conflict's duration far exceeds what was necessary to make a clear statement. We should have achieved our aim within the first few months. Yet, the war drags on, and our reason for continuing is increasingly murky. The war has become an end in itself, with a desire for a decisive victory or exit seemingly more important than the original goal of bringing democracy. It's time to let the local government handle their own affairs. Our economy is suffering, and we have pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure to address. We should be prioritizing our own problems rather than a long-term foreign war. The expenditure on this conflict is not sustainable, and the resources could be better spent on improving our own society.",

            "The Iraq War topic is significant and one I must address; it's a sensitive issue, and I feel compelled to share my perspective, despite its redundancy. Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",
            "Certainly, gender inequality persists in the United States, and it isn't confined to just women. The nature of work can also play a significant role. Women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications, they are passed over for promotions because society expects women to be in subordinate positions.\n\nMoreover, men too face their own set of challenges. For instance, a man choosing to stay at home to be a parent faces societal disapproval. Society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners, and a man defying this norm is often met with disdain.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender bias is evident. Men involved in fashion, especially if they are straight, are sometimes not taken seriously, as they are seen as lacking the \"experience\" of dealing with fashion from a woman's perspective.\n\nIn essence, the prevalence of gender discrimination is influenced by the type of work and the societal expectations surrounding it. Efforts to dismantle these biases are underway but are progressing slowly. Society's mindset is deeply entrenched, and change takes time. It’s crucial to promote the positive aspects of those who are stereotyped without being aggressive. As we see more women in leadership roles and more men at home, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination isn't limited to gender but can also be based on one's upbringing and education. For example, a CEO who grew up on a farm and has less-than-perfect grammar may face discrimination from peers who do not see the value in their intelligence due to their background.\n\nIt's a complex issue with many facets, but progress is indeed being made.",
            "The policy shift entailed a change from criminal to civil penalties. What was once a criminal offense now carries the weight of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. One might receive a citation instead of being booked and arrested. Such a paradigm shift has implications, particularly for job applications and similar contexts, where a drug charge can be a significant hindrance. The future ramifications, especially for marijuana offenses, remain a concern despite the decriminalization. However, the financial burden on municipalities, which includes arrest, booking, legal representation, and court appearances, is considerable. Some communities might hesitate to decriminalize due to these costs and philosophical opposition. In places like Denver, known for its liberal stance, such a change can lead to improved municipal services, such as education and social programs. While marijuana may not be desirable on every street corner, the financial benefits for communities are substantial. However, legalization could lead to widespread availability and use, potentially causing discomfort in society. Conversely, alcohol remains more harmful in terms of motor skills, although both substances have their adverse effects. Personal reactions vary, making it challenging to generalize. Yet, both substances carry risks, and the ability to moderate their use differs from person to person.",
            "I would assert a resounding affirmative in response to your query.\nIndeed, there is a plethora of traditional practices within the Catholic Church that have been maintained over substantial durations.\nRooted in tradition, these rituals provide a sense of continuity and familiarity, which is crucial.\nNevertheless, it is essential to remain adaptable to change, as the world around us is ever-evolving.\nQuite often, it is observed that adherents of the Catholic faith are expected to attend church regularly, with a strict adherence to the doctrines and rituals.\nSometimes, this can lead to feelings of exclusion and intolerance towards those who do not wholeheartedly embrace the Catholicism.\nFor instance, my parents' wedding was not solemnized in the Catholic Church owing to my father's Episcopalian faith, despite the Church's teaching of love and acceptance.\nThis disparity between doctrine and practice can appear contradictory and hypocritical.\nMoreover, while I believe that permitting priests to marry could be advantageous, I do not think it would necessarily mitigate the risk of pedophilic behavior.\nThe problem lies not in marital status, but in the nature of the acts themselves.\nHence, I do not believe that marital status would significantly influence the likelihood of such atrocities.",
            "I must confess, I'm still grappling with this conundrum, and thus, I cannot definitively assert one perspective's superiority over the other. This is perhaps the most contentious issue we face today, especially concerning the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. It seems exceedingly challenging to navigate these waters without causing offense. I suggest considering civil unions, rather than marriage, to avoid entangling the government in religious matters. After all, if two individuals have joined together in a union, shouldn't it be recognized as such, irrespective of their religious beliefs? Moreover, if all states can reach a consensus, they should strive to make it a federal law. However, I strongly oppose the notion of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; it's too significant a cause to warrant altering the constitution. Simply put, it's not substantial enough to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "I hail from a household where Christianity has been a guiding principle, thus I find my stance on homosexuality to be somewhat ambiguous. My circle of friends includes many who identify as LGBTQ+, and while my personal beliefs may not align with their lifestyle, I maintain that they should be legally recognized as equals. To me, the issue of gay marriage is best handled at the state level, rather than by the national government. Each state, after all, has its own political dynamics and cultural landscape, with some leaning more towards liberal policies and others more conservative. Therefore, I believe that the decision to legalize gay marriage should rest with the people of each state, not with the president. I am opposed to a national ban on gay marriage, as it would impose one group's views on the entire nation. Additionally, with the presidency being a temporary position, I think it's unfair for a single leader to set policies that will impact the country for years to come. It's far more reasonable and democratic to leave such matters to the states, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the decision.",
            "I suppose it's fair to say I don't wholly agree. Let's consider the facts. Myspace, for instance, is designed for public use, hence the name. It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place.",
            "I must preface this by acknowledging the profound impact of the events of September 11th on me personally. Initially, I was swayed by the desire for retribution and, in a sense, to wreak havoc as a response to the devastation inflicted upon our soil. However, I've since come to realize that our hasty and emotionally-driven decision to intervene was a grave mistake. The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs. Our presence there has only served to prolong the conflict and create more destruction than it has alleviated. I believe that we are doing more harm than good by remaining."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve. The institution has been grappling with a dwindling number of adherents, and I believe this is largely due to its stringent stances on various social issues. For instance, the Church's position on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception tends to be conservative, which can alienate those who hold opposing views. While these views are deeply ingrained, they may be perceived as outdated. A slight adjustment towards more modern perspectives could potentially mitigate this decline in support. There's a growing segment of the population that's drifting away from the Church due to its viewpoints on these subjects. For example, someone who supports abortion or same-sex marriage may struggle to reconcile these beliefs with the Church's teachings. I am of the opinion that there is no inherent reason why the Church cannot allow female priests or permit priests to marry. While these changes might not have prevented past incidents, they could represent a shift towards a more inclusive and flexible institution. The Church's current policy of requiring celibacy for priests, which it views as a spiritual commitment to God, could, in my opinion, be re-evaluated. Many professionals balance their work with family life and other relationships, so why shouldn't priests be allowed to do the same? However, it's challenging to predict whether such changes would fundamentally alter the Church's behavior in significant ways.",
            "Well, um, I'm not adverse to the idea of same-sex marriage. I mean, I believe that individuals are born with their sexual orientation and I don't think it's something one can necessarily choose. Consequently, I don't believe that gay individuals should be held accountable for their orientation. I find it rather inequitable that a man and a woman can wed, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't really delved deeply into this topic, but I would certainly argue that it's unjust to restrict gay couples from marriage. It's not like they have a choice in their orientation; it's an inherent aspect of their being. I don't believe the federal government should be invested in this matter, as it's not a matter of national security or morals. The government should not interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to who they love. It's simply who they are and they shouldn't be penalized for that. That's my perspective on the matter.",
            "I contend that same-sex marriage ought to be legally recognized. The reasons against it, however, are not compelling. Many argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this perspective is flawed due to the diversity and complexity of relationships. This is akin to viewing heads and tails as distinct entities, even though they are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, numerous civil rights, including property tax benefits and healthcare considerations, are at stake. For instance, the partner of a gay individual may not be permitted to visit in the event of illness, as they are not technically considered family. This seems arbitrary given the commitment such couples share. Scientific research, notably the high rates of relationship satisfaction among homosexual couples, contradicts this notion. Fundamentally, they are requesting a legal document rather than a religious ceremony. Legally recognizing these unions would not breach church-state separation, as it would not involve religious officiation. Segregation and inequality are reminiscent of past policies, and legislation against same-sex marriage is a new form of this. Children of gay couples are often the focus of concern, but studies suggest that parental orientation does not significantly impact their adjustment. Ultimately, the federal government should intervene to legalize same-sex marriage in every state. However, President Bush's stance is grounded in his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. This perspective, while valid, should not dictate national law. Morality, after all, varies greatly among individuals and cultural groups. To impose one group's morality on the entire nation is unethical. Some oppose same-sex marriage due to psychological misconceptions about homosexuality, a notion debunked by the American Psychological Association. Education on these issues is crucial, as it often refutes popular misconceptions and promotes acceptance.",
            "In the course of employment at a hospital pharmacy during the summer months, certain observations regarding illegal drugs have become evident. The mere fact that a substance is deemed unlawful does not inherently negate its potential therapeutic value. Consequently, while I would not advocate for unrestricted public access to such compounds, I do recognize that, in certain contexts, their medicinal properties may be harnessed. For instance, drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which fall under controlled substances, are routinely used in clinical settings due to their beneficial effects. Therefore, to arbitrarily deny similar advantages from other substances, such as marijuana, solely based on societal stigmas appears shortsighted.\n\nMoreover, I contend that a gradual, controlled legalization of marijuana, rather than an abrupt decriminalization, could mitigate potential misuse. By first addressing the cultural taboo surrounding cannabis and promoting responsible use, society could transition more responsibly. The stigma associated with marijuana, often erroneously paralleled to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine, must be dismantled to foster a more pragmatic approach to its potential benefits, particularly in medical applications.",
            "The church has undoubtedly evolved with the times, adapting to the 21st century. The rigidness that once characterized it has significantly diminished. Growing up, I frequently attended church every Sunday, often donning cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. My religious education was a fundamental aspect of my life, and I enjoyed the structured social environment. However, as I've grown older, the church has introduced more contemporary aspects, such as a teenager-friendly mass that's been shortened to thirty minutes and a more casual dress code, particularly during summer. Families often join late, and it's not uncommon to see beach attire. Even morning masses, typically a time for more formal attire, now feature jeans and khakis. The change in the church's atmosphere and dress code is quite noticeable.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Men who become pedophiles are not necessarily deterred by marital status; their attractions are often rooted in genetics. I suspect that these issues are primarily a matter of individual predisposition and not necessarily a result of marital restrictions or lack thereof. If priests are genuinely driven to practice their faith and marry, perhaps they should consider denominations that permit both.\n\nIn my view, the tendency towards pedophilia in some men might be more about inherent genetics than upbringing. Marriage is not a shield against such tendencies, as they often manifest regardless. If the church becomes aware of these issues and attempts to cover them up, that's highly regrettable. However, I doubt that all cases involved knowledge or cover-ups from the church's leadership. My thoughts on the Catholic Church are limited to these observations and don't extend to other aspects of its teachings or practices.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially found the Iraq War's foundation to be tenuous, an opinion amplified by the lingering shock of the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein's regime to Al-Qaeda and the alleged weapons of mass destruction was tenuous and has since been debunked. This misinformation, coupled with the administration's disregard for public interest, has left a sour taste in my mouth. The Iraq War has become a contentious issue, exacerbated by the Bush administration's persistent deceit and constitutional contempt.\n\nColin Powell's recent admissions about his UN presentation underscore this. The administration's willingness to mislead the public, a clear breach of office integrity, has set a precedent of malfeasance. The younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's past, and his interest in securing energy resources, further underscores the war's underhanded origins.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the potential chaos that could ensue from an immediate withdrawal, the current coalition of nations proposed by the UN and USA seems no less fraught. Iraq's political landscape is riddled with disunity and radical factions. The interim government's weakness is evident, with the Prime Minister's control tenuous and key political players like Moqtada al-Sadr gaining significant influence. This political friction, coupled with the sovereignty issue, suggests a precarious situation that may not be easily resolved.\n\nIn polite circles, I refrain from expressing these thoughts, but in an unguarded moment, it's clear that the Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue that has left a lasting impact on the nation and the world.",
            "Oh, alright, let's just dive into this discussion. You want me to share my views on the War in Iraq? Sure thing.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'm not really one to keep up with the finer details of current events. I mean, I know the basics, like the fact that it wasn't exactly a declared war. It felt more like we were just trying to \"even the score\" after 9/11, aiming our sights at Iraq because we suspected they had a hand in those attacks.\n\nI just don't feel strongly about it, you know? I don't really follow the ins and outs. But what I do know is that we've been there for a while, trying to build some sort of democracy. I'm not sure if that's the best use of our resources, though. We've been there so long, and it's causing a lot of unrest, both in Iraq and here at home.\n\nI mean, look at the Vietnam War. It wasn't declared by Congress either, and it's become known as a meaningless conflict. And now, if we leave Iraq, it's going to look like George W. Bush started a pointless war, and that's going to be his legacy. It's not a good look.\n\nBut then again, there are families affected. Sons and daughters over there, fighting in a war that's causing more division and strife. Shouldn't we be helping them? Shouldn't we be trying to make things better for them?\n\nBut at the same time, we're trying to impose our culture and values on a country that has been under a totalitarian system for so long. It's like we're trying to turn them into a second United States, and that could just fuel more hatred towards us. Think about it, Al-Qaeda and all that.\n\nSo, I don't know. It's a tough situation. I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.",
            "Certainly, I must express my reservations about the proposal to legally or statutorily declare it as such. I believe that the decision should rest with the churches, as enshrined in the Constitution's provision for the separation of church and state. It is unequivocally stated, and I maintain that any attempt to exert control over it would be an affront to the established principles. Those advocating for its illegality appear to be favoring one denomination's beliefs over others, as the majority of Catholic and Christian communities are opposed to it, save for a few isolated instances. I contend that the government should not dictate what the churches can or cannot legalize, as this goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in the United States. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, and amending this to restrict it would be counterintuitive and potentially restrictive of individual freedoms. Such an amendment would be unprecedented in its focus on curbing personal liberties rather than government power. Furthermore, I see no compelling reason for the federal government to meddle in this matter, as the president's push seems driven more by his personal beliefs as a Catholic than any broader societal benefits. This is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government, and I fail to see how an amendment, backed only by personal convictions, would have any positive impact. In essence, I believe the churches should decide this issue, not the government or any constituent of it.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nIndeed, the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion was shrouded in ambiguity regarding the government's motives. The notion that the Iraq War was directly linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11th was largely speculative, with the administration manipulating public sentiment to justify military action. The invasion began in 2003, following a period of heightened national outrage over the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn my personal stance, I am staunchly opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in my view, echoes the Vietnam War in its execution and the subsequent aftermath. The loss of numerous American lives is a stark reminder of the gravity of this decision.\n\nThe US government's preparedness for the post-invasion vacuum of power and the resultant chaos was woefully inadequate. The initial plan was to establish a democratic government, similar to the efforts in Vietnam, but the expectation of swift success was naive. The reality was a prolonged, complex struggle with a significant civilian populace resistant to foreign intervention.\n\nThe government's failure to anticipate the prolonged nature of the conflict, coupled with the sheer volume of American casualties, highlights a clear lack of thorough planning. The ongoing training of Iraqi troops and police forces to stabilize the nation underscores the magnitude of the task. The US government's reliance on oil resources and geopolitical interests further clouds the true intentions behind the invasion.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq remains a contentious one, with the 2004 presidential election serving as a focal point for my deliberations. While the sentiment to see the mission through is strong, the fiscal and human cost is also a critical consideration. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the disparity in response to similar threats in other nations, such as North Korea, calls into question the US government's transparency and the underlying reasons for military action.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and divisive issue. The hope for a swift resolution remains, but the reality is a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight.",

            "The digital age has transformed communication, and with it, the implications of what we share online. Once a piece of information is posted on the internet, it becomes a public record, accessible to anyone and everyone. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've had firsthand experience with this very concept. What you post can color how others perceive you, and in extreme cases, it might even lead to serious consequences.\n\nImagine, for instance, if you share content about violent acts or threats. It's crucial to understand that this information can reach authorities, who would then be obligated to investigate due to the potential danger. It's a delicate balance, as not all internet content is indicative of genuine intent. Some individuals might post seemingly innocuous statements that could, in certain contexts, be taken seriously.\n\nIn my school, we've faced situations where overheard comments led to school officials investigating. While it's important to respect privacy, it's also essential to recognize that sharing potentially harmful information circumvents that right. If content is brought to the attention of school officials, they must take it seriously to ensure the safety of the community.\n\nI must stress, though, that I'm not advocating for school officials to monitor private communications like Facebook, Myspace, or even Xanga. Such intrusions are not appropriate. However, when information is shared openly and becomes a matter of public concern, it's a different story. If students are friends with their teachers on these platforms, and a teacher isn't acting deceptively, then any shared information should be taken seriously.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an RA, I wouldn't befriend residents on social media. I prefer to maintain a professional boundary, and I certainly wouldn't want to see personal content that might be inappropriate. However, if concerns arise, I'm duty-bound to address them appropriately, ensuring the safety and well-being of the students under my care.",
            "The conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable: to restore democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, over time, it seems we've lost sight of this objective. The war has become a prolonged display of power, with potential personal agendas from previous political entanglements clouding the initial, noble intent. The conflict's duration far exceeds what was necessary to make a clear statement. We should have achieved our aim within the first few months. Yet, the war drags on, and our reason for continuing is increasingly murky. The war has become an end in itself, with a desire for a decisive victory or exit seemingly more important than the original goal of bringing democracy. It's time to let the local government handle their own affairs. Our economy is suffering, and we have pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure to address. We should be prioritizing our own problems rather than a long-term foreign war. The expenditure on this conflict is not sustainable, and the resources could be better spent on improving our own society.",

            "The Iraq War topic is significant and one I must address; it's a sensitive issue, and I feel compelled to share my perspective, despite its redundancy. Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",
            "Certainly, gender inequality persists in the United States, and it isn't confined to just women. The nature of work can also play a significant role. Women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications, they are passed over for promotions because society expects women to be in subordinate positions.\n\nMoreover, men too face their own set of challenges. For instance, a man choosing to stay at home to be a parent faces societal disapproval. Society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners, and a man defying this norm is often met with disdain.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender bias is evident. Men involved in fashion, especially if they are straight, are sometimes not taken seriously, as they are seen as lacking the \"experience\" of dealing with fashion from a woman's perspective.\n\nIn essence, the prevalence of gender discrimination is influenced by the type of work and the societal expectations surrounding it. Efforts to dismantle these biases are underway but are progressing slowly. Society's mindset is deeply entrenched, and change takes time. It’s crucial to promote the positive aspects of those who are stereotyped without being aggressive. As we see more women in leadership roles and more men at home, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination isn't limited to gender but can also be based on one's upbringing and education. For example, a CEO who grew up on a farm and has less-than-perfect grammar may face discrimination from peers who do not see the value in their intelligence due to their background.\n\nIt's a complex issue with many facets, but progress is indeed being made.",
            "The policy shift entailed a change from criminal to civil penalties. What was once a criminal offense now carries the weight of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. One might receive a citation instead of being booked and arrested. Such a paradigm shift has implications, particularly for job applications and similar contexts, where a drug charge can be a significant hindrance. The future ramifications, especially for marijuana offenses, remain a concern despite the decriminalization. However, the financial burden on municipalities, which includes arrest, booking, legal representation, and court appearances, is considerable. Some communities might hesitate to decriminalize due to these costs and philosophical opposition. In places like Denver, known for its liberal stance, such a change can lead to improved municipal services, such as education and social programs. While marijuana may not be desirable on every street corner, the financial benefits for communities are substantial. However, legalization could lead to widespread availability and use, potentially causing discomfort in society. Conversely, alcohol remains more harmful in terms of motor skills, although both substances have their adverse effects. Personal reactions vary, making it challenging to generalize. Yet, both substances carry risks, and the ability to moderate their use differs from person to person.",
            "I would assert a resounding affirmative in response to your query.\nIndeed, there is a plethora of traditional practices within the Catholic Church that have been maintained over substantial durations.\nRooted in tradition, these rituals provide a sense of continuity and familiarity, which is crucial.\nNevertheless, it is essential to remain adaptable to change, as the world around us is ever-evolving.\nQuite often, it is observed that adherents of the Catholic faith are expected to attend church regularly, with a strict adherence to the doctrines and rituals.\nSometimes, this can lead to feelings of exclusion and intolerance towards those who do not wholeheartedly embrace the Catholicism.\nFor instance, my parents' wedding was not solemnized in the Catholic Church owing to my father's Episcopalian faith, despite the Church's teaching of love and acceptance.\nThis disparity between doctrine and practice can appear contradictory and hypocritical.\nMoreover, while I believe that permitting priests to marry could be advantageous, I do not think it would necessarily mitigate the risk of pedophilic behavior.\nThe problem lies not in marital status, but in the nature of the acts themselves.\nHence, I do not believe that marital status would significantly influence the likelihood of such atrocities.",
            "I must confess, I'm still grappling with this conundrum, and thus, I cannot definitively assert one perspective's superiority over the other. This is perhaps the most contentious issue we face today, especially concerning the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. It seems exceedingly challenging to navigate these waters without causing offense. I suggest considering civil unions, rather than marriage, to avoid entangling the government in religious matters. After all, if two individuals have joined together in a union, shouldn't it be recognized as such, irrespective of their religious beliefs? Moreover, if all states can reach a consensus, they should strive to make it a federal law. However, I strongly oppose the notion of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; it's too significant a cause to warrant altering the constitution. Simply put, it's not substantial enough to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "I hail from a household where Christianity has been a guiding principle, thus I find my stance on homosexuality to be somewhat ambiguous. My circle of friends includes many who identify as LGBTQ+, and while my personal beliefs may not align with their lifestyle, I maintain that they should be legally recognized as equals. To me, the issue of gay marriage is best handled at the state level, rather than by the national government. Each state, after all, has its own political dynamics and cultural landscape, with some leaning more towards liberal policies and others more conservative. Therefore, I believe that the decision to legalize gay marriage should rest with the people of each state, not with the president. I am opposed to a national ban on gay marriage, as it would impose one group's views on the entire nation. Additionally, with the presidency being a temporary position, I think it's unfair for a single leader to set policies that will impact the country for years to come. It's far more reasonable and democratic to leave such matters to the states, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the decision.",
            "I suppose it's fair to say I don't wholly agree. Let's consider the facts. Myspace, for instance, is designed for public use, hence the name. It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place.",
            "I must preface this by acknowledging the profound impact of the events of September 11th on me personally. Initially, I was swayed by the desire for retribution and, in a sense, to wreak havoc as a response to the devastation inflicted upon our soil. However, I've since come to realize that our hasty and emotionally-driven decision to intervene was a grave mistake. The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs. Our presence there has only served to prolong the conflict and create more destruction than it has alleviated. I believe that we are doing more harm than good by remaining."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve. The institution has been grappling with a dwindling number of adherents, and I believe this is largely due to its stringent stances on various social issues. For instance, the Church's position on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception tends to be conservative, which can alienate those who hold opposing views. While these views are deeply ingrained, they may be perceived as outdated. A slight adjustment towards more modern perspectives could potentially mitigate this decline in support. There's a growing segment of the population that's drifting away from the Church due to its viewpoints on these subjects. For example, someone who supports abortion or same-sex marriage may struggle to reconcile these beliefs with the Church's teachings. I am of the opinion that there is no inherent reason why the Church cannot allow female priests or permit priests to marry. While these changes might not have prevented past incidents, they could represent a shift towards a more inclusive and flexible institution. The Church's current policy of requiring celibacy for priests, which it views as a spiritual commitment to God, could, in my opinion, be re-evaluated. Many professionals balance their work with family life and other relationships, so why shouldn't priests be allowed to do the same? However, it's challenging to predict whether such changes would fundamentally alter the Church's behavior in significant ways.",
            "Well, um, I'm not adverse to the idea of same-sex marriage. I mean, I believe that individuals are born with their sexual orientation and I don't think it's something one can necessarily choose. Consequently, I don't believe that gay individuals should be held accountable for their orientation. I find it rather inequitable that a man and a woman can wed, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't really delved deeply into this topic, but I would certainly argue that it's unjust to restrict gay couples from marriage. It's not like they have a choice in their orientation; it's an inherent aspect of their being. I don't believe the federal government should be invested in this matter, as it's not a matter of national security or morals. The government should not interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to who they love. It's simply who they are and they shouldn't be penalized for that. That's my perspective on the matter.",
            "I contend that same-sex marriage ought to be legally recognized. The reasons against it, however, are not compelling. Many argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this perspective is flawed due to the diversity and complexity of relationships. This is akin to viewing heads and tails as distinct entities, even though they are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, numerous civil rights, including property tax benefits and healthcare considerations, are at stake. For instance, the partner of a gay individual may not be permitted to visit in the event of illness, as they are not technically considered family. This seems arbitrary given the commitment such couples share. Scientific research, notably the high rates of relationship satisfaction among homosexual couples, contradicts this notion. Fundamentally, they are requesting a legal document rather than a religious ceremony. Legally recognizing these unions would not breach church-state separation, as it would not involve religious officiation. Segregation and inequality are reminiscent of past policies, and legislation against same-sex marriage is a new form of this. Children of gay couples are often the focus of concern, but studies suggest that parental orientation does not significantly impact their adjustment. Ultimately, the federal government should intervene to legalize same-sex marriage in every state. However, President Bush's stance is grounded in his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. This perspective, while valid, should not dictate national law. Morality, after all, varies greatly among individuals and cultural groups. To impose one group's morality on the entire nation is unethical. Some oppose same-sex marriage due to psychological misconceptions about homosexuality, a notion debunked by the American Psychological Association. Education on these issues is crucial, as it often refutes popular misconceptions and promotes acceptance.",
            "In the course of employment at a hospital pharmacy during the summer months, certain observations regarding illegal drugs have become evident. The mere fact that a substance is deemed unlawful does not inherently negate its potential therapeutic value. Consequently, while I would not advocate for unrestricted public access to such compounds, I do recognize that, in certain contexts, their medicinal properties may be harnessed. For instance, drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which fall under controlled substances, are routinely used in clinical settings due to their beneficial effects. Therefore, to arbitrarily deny similar advantages from other substances, such as marijuana, solely based on societal stigmas appears shortsighted.\n\nMoreover, I contend that a gradual, controlled legalization of marijuana, rather than an abrupt decriminalization, could mitigate potential misuse. By first addressing the cultural taboo surrounding cannabis and promoting responsible use, society could transition more responsibly. The stigma associated with marijuana, often erroneously paralleled to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine, must be dismantled to foster a more pragmatic approach to its potential benefits, particularly in medical applications.",
            "The church has undoubtedly evolved with the times, adapting to the 21st century. The rigidness that once characterized it has significantly diminished. Growing up, I frequently attended church every Sunday, often donning cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. My religious education was a fundamental aspect of my life, and I enjoyed the structured social environment. However, as I've grown older, the church has introduced more contemporary aspects, such as a teenager-friendly mass that's been shortened to thirty minutes and a more casual dress code, particularly during summer. Families often join late, and it's not uncommon to see beach attire. Even morning masses, typically a time for more formal attire, now feature jeans and khakis. The change in the church's atmosphere and dress code is quite noticeable.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Men who become pedophiles are not necessarily deterred by marital status; their attractions are often rooted in genetics. I suspect that these issues are primarily a matter of individual predisposition and not necessarily a result of marital restrictions or lack thereof. If priests are genuinely driven to practice their faith and marry, perhaps they should consider denominations that permit both.\n\nIn my view, the tendency towards pedophilia in some men might be more about inherent genetics than upbringing. Marriage is not a shield against such tendencies, as they often manifest regardless. If the church becomes aware of these issues and attempts to cover them up, that's highly regrettable. However, I doubt that all cases involved knowledge or cover-ups from the church's leadership. My thoughts on the Catholic Church are limited to these observations and don't extend to other aspects of its teachings or practices.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially found the Iraq War's foundation to be tenuous, an opinion amplified by the lingering shock of the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein's regime to Al-Qaeda and the alleged weapons of mass destruction was tenuous and has since been debunked. This misinformation, coupled with the administration's disregard for public interest, has left a sour taste in my mouth. The Iraq War has become a contentious issue, exacerbated by the Bush administration's persistent deceit and constitutional contempt.\n\nColin Powell's recent admissions about his UN presentation underscore this. The administration's willingness to mislead the public, a clear breach of office integrity, has set a precedent of malfeasance. The younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's past, and his interest in securing energy resources, further underscores the war's underhanded origins.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the potential chaos that could ensue from an immediate withdrawal, the current coalition of nations proposed by the UN and USA seems no less fraught. Iraq's political landscape is riddled with disunity and radical factions. The interim government's weakness is evident, with the Prime Minister's control tenuous and key political players like Moqtada al-Sadr gaining significant influence. This political friction, coupled with the sovereignty issue, suggests a precarious situation that may not be easily resolved.\n\nIn polite circles, I refrain from expressing these thoughts, but in an unguarded moment, it's clear that the Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue that has left a lasting impact on the nation and the world.",
            "Oh, alright, let's just dive into this discussion. You want me to share my views on the War in Iraq? Sure thing.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'm not really one to keep up with the finer details of current events. I mean, I know the basics, like the fact that it wasn't exactly a declared war. It felt more like we were just trying to \"even the score\" after 9/11, aiming our sights at Iraq because we suspected they had a hand in those attacks.\n\nI just don't feel strongly about it, you know? I don't really follow the ins and outs. But what I do know is that we've been there for a while, trying to build some sort of democracy. I'm not sure if that's the best use of our resources, though. We've been there so long, and it's causing a lot of unrest, both in Iraq and here at home.\n\nI mean, look at the Vietnam War. It wasn't declared by Congress either, and it's become known as a meaningless conflict. And now, if we leave Iraq, it's going to look like George W. Bush started a pointless war, and that's going to be his legacy. It's not a good look.\n\nBut then again, there are families affected. Sons and daughters over there, fighting in a war that's causing more division and strife. Shouldn't we be helping them? Shouldn't we be trying to make things better for them?\n\nBut at the same time, we're trying to impose our culture and values on a country that has been under a totalitarian system for so long. It's like we're trying to turn them into a second United States, and that could just fuel more hatred towards us. Think about it, Al-Qaeda and all that.\n\nSo, I don't know. It's a tough situation. I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.",
            "Certainly, I must express my reservations about the proposal to legally or statutorily declare it as such. I believe that the decision should rest with the churches, as enshrined in the Constitution's provision for the separation of church and state. It is unequivocally stated, and I maintain that any attempt to exert control over it would be an affront to the established principles. Those advocating for its illegality appear to be favoring one denomination's beliefs over others, as the majority of Catholic and Christian communities are opposed to it, save for a few isolated instances. I contend that the government should not dictate what the churches can or cannot legalize, as this goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in the United States. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, and amending this to restrict it would be counterintuitive and potentially restrictive of individual freedoms. Such an amendment would be unprecedented in its focus on curbing personal liberties rather than government power. Furthermore, I see no compelling reason for the federal government to meddle in this matter, as the president's push seems driven more by his personal beliefs as a Catholic than any broader societal benefits. This is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government, and I fail to see how an amendment, backed only by personal convictions, would have any positive impact. In essence, I believe the churches should decide this issue, not the government or any constituent of it.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nIndeed, the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion was shrouded in ambiguity regarding the government's motives. The notion that the Iraq War was directly linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11th was largely speculative, with the administration manipulating public sentiment to justify military action. The invasion began in 2003, following a period of heightened national outrage over the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn my personal stance, I am staunchly opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in my view, echoes the Vietnam War in its execution and the subsequent aftermath. The loss of numerous American lives is a stark reminder of the gravity of this decision.\n\nThe US government's preparedness for the post-invasion vacuum of power and the resultant chaos was woefully inadequate. The initial plan was to establish a democratic government, similar to the efforts in Vietnam, but the expectation of swift success was naive. The reality was a prolonged, complex struggle with a significant civilian populace resistant to foreign intervention.\n\nThe government's failure to anticipate the prolonged nature of the conflict, coupled with the sheer volume of American casualties, highlights a clear lack of thorough planning. The ongoing training of Iraqi troops and police forces to stabilize the nation underscores the magnitude of the task. The US government's reliance on oil resources and geopolitical interests further clouds the true intentions behind the invasion.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq remains a contentious one, with the 2004 presidential election serving as a focal point for my deliberations. While the sentiment to see the mission through is strong, the fiscal and human cost is also a critical consideration. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the disparity in response to similar threats in other nations, such as North Korea, calls into question the US government's transparency and the underlying reasons for military action.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and divisive issue. The hope for a swift resolution remains, but the reality is a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight.",

            "The digital age has transformed communication, and with it, the implications of what we share online. Once a piece of information is posted on the internet, it becomes a public record, accessible to anyone and everyone. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've had firsthand experience with this very concept. What you post can color how others perceive you, and in extreme cases, it might even lead to serious consequences.\n\nImagine, for instance, if you share content about violent acts or threats. It's crucial to understand that this information can reach authorities, who would then be obligated to investigate due to the potential danger. It's a delicate balance, as not all internet content is indicative of genuine intent. Some individuals might post seemingly innocuous statements that could, in certain contexts, be taken seriously.\n\nIn my school, we've faced situations where overheard comments led to school officials investigating. While it's important to respect privacy, it's also essential to recognize that sharing potentially harmful information circumvents that right. If content is brought to the attention of school officials, they must take it seriously to ensure the safety of the community.\n\nI must stress, though, that I'm not advocating for school officials to monitor private communications like Facebook, Myspace, or even Xanga. Such intrusions are not appropriate. However, when information is shared openly and becomes a matter of public concern, it's a different story. If students are friends with their teachers on these platforms, and a teacher isn't acting deceptively, then any shared information should be taken seriously.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an RA, I wouldn't befriend residents on social media. I prefer to maintain a professional boundary, and I certainly wouldn't want to see personal content that might be inappropriate. However, if concerns arise, I'm duty-bound to address them appropriately, ensuring the safety and well-being of the students under my care.",
            "The conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable: to restore democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, over time, it seems we've lost sight of this objective. The war has become a prolonged display of power, with potential personal agendas from previous political entanglements clouding the initial, noble intent. The conflict's duration far exceeds what was necessary to make a clear statement. We should have achieved our aim within the first few months. Yet, the war drags on, and our reason for continuing is increasingly murky. The war has become an end in itself, with a desire for a decisive victory or exit seemingly more important than the original goal of bringing democracy. It's time to let the local government handle their own affairs. Our economy is suffering, and we have pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure to address. We should be prioritizing our own problems rather than a long-term foreign war. The expenditure on this conflict is not sustainable, and the resources could be better spent on improving our own society.",

            "The Iraq War topic is significant and one I must address; it's a sensitive issue, and I feel compelled to share my perspective, despite its redundancy. Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",
            "Certainly, gender inequality persists in the United States, and it isn't confined to just women. The nature of work can also play a significant role. Women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications, they are passed over for promotions because society expects women to be in subordinate positions.\n\nMoreover, men too face their own set of challenges. For instance, a man choosing to stay at home to be a parent faces societal disapproval. Society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners, and a man defying this norm is often met with disdain.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender bias is evident. Men involved in fashion, especially if they are straight, are sometimes not taken seriously, as they are seen as lacking the \"experience\" of dealing with fashion from a woman's perspective.\n\nIn essence, the prevalence of gender discrimination is influenced by the type of work and the societal expectations surrounding it. Efforts to dismantle these biases are underway but are progressing slowly. Society's mindset is deeply entrenched, and change takes time. It’s crucial to promote the positive aspects of those who are stereotyped without being aggressive. As we see more women in leadership roles and more men at home, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination isn't limited to gender but can also be based on one's upbringing and education. For example, a CEO who grew up on a farm and has less-than-perfect grammar may face discrimination from peers who do not see the value in their intelligence due to their background.\n\nIt's a complex issue with many facets, but progress is indeed being made.",
            "The policy shift entailed a change from criminal to civil penalties. What was once a criminal offense now carries the weight of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. One might receive a citation instead of being booked and arrested. Such a paradigm shift has implications, particularly for job applications and similar contexts, where a drug charge can be a significant hindrance. The future ramifications, especially for marijuana offenses, remain a concern despite the decriminalization. However, the financial burden on municipalities, which includes arrest, booking, legal representation, and court appearances, is considerable. Some communities might hesitate to decriminalize due to these costs and philosophical opposition. In places like Denver, known for its liberal stance, such a change can lead to improved municipal services, such as education and social programs. While marijuana may not be desirable on every street corner, the financial benefits for communities are substantial. However, legalization could lead to widespread availability and use, potentially causing discomfort in society. Conversely, alcohol remains more harmful in terms of motor skills, although both substances have their adverse effects. Personal reactions vary, making it challenging to generalize. Yet, both substances carry risks, and the ability to moderate their use differs from person to person.",
            "I would assert a resounding affirmative in response to your query.\nIndeed, there is a plethora of traditional practices within the Catholic Church that have been maintained over substantial durations.\nRooted in tradition, these rituals provide a sense of continuity and familiarity, which is crucial.\nNevertheless, it is essential to remain adaptable to change, as the world around us is ever-evolving.\nQuite often, it is observed that adherents of the Catholic faith are expected to attend church regularly, with a strict adherence to the doctrines and rituals.\nSometimes, this can lead to feelings of exclusion and intolerance towards those who do not wholeheartedly embrace the Catholicism.\nFor instance, my parents' wedding was not solemnized in the Catholic Church owing to my father's Episcopalian faith, despite the Church's teaching of love and acceptance.\nThis disparity between doctrine and practice can appear contradictory and hypocritical.\nMoreover, while I believe that permitting priests to marry could be advantageous, I do not think it would necessarily mitigate the risk of pedophilic behavior.\nThe problem lies not in marital status, but in the nature of the acts themselves.\nHence, I do not believe that marital status would significantly influence the likelihood of such atrocities.",
            "I must confess, I'm still grappling with this conundrum, and thus, I cannot definitively assert one perspective's superiority over the other. This is perhaps the most contentious issue we face today, especially concerning the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. It seems exceedingly challenging to navigate these waters without causing offense. I suggest considering civil unions, rather than marriage, to avoid entangling the government in religious matters. After all, if two individuals have joined together in a union, shouldn't it be recognized as such, irrespective of their religious beliefs? Moreover, if all states can reach a consensus, they should strive to make it a federal law. However, I strongly oppose the notion of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; it's too significant a cause to warrant altering the constitution. Simply put, it's not substantial enough to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "I hail from a household where Christianity has been a guiding principle, thus I find my stance on homosexuality to be somewhat ambiguous. My circle of friends includes many who identify as LGBTQ+, and while my personal beliefs may not align with their lifestyle, I maintain that they should be legally recognized as equals. To me, the issue of gay marriage is best handled at the state level, rather than by the national government. Each state, after all, has its own political dynamics and cultural landscape, with some leaning more towards liberal policies and others more conservative. Therefore, I believe that the decision to legalize gay marriage should rest with the people of each state, not with the president. I am opposed to a national ban on gay marriage, as it would impose one group's views on the entire nation. Additionally, with the presidency being a temporary position, I think it's unfair for a single leader to set policies that will impact the country for years to come. It's far more reasonable and democratic to leave such matters to the states, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the decision.",
            "I suppose it's fair to say I don't wholly agree. Let's consider the facts. Myspace, for instance, is designed for public use, hence the name. It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place.",
            "I must preface this by acknowledging the profound impact of the events of September 11th on me personally. Initially, I was swayed by the desire for retribution and, in a sense, to wreak havoc as a response to the devastation inflicted upon our soil. However, I've since come to realize that our hasty and emotionally-driven decision to intervene was a grave mistake. The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs. Our presence there has only served to prolong the conflict and create more destruction than it has alleviated. I believe that we are doing more harm than good by remaining."
