            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It seems evident that the Catholic Church could benefit from some reconsideration in their stance on certain issues. Various interpretations have been made about the church's dwindling membership, and I believe it's due, in part, to their sometimes rigid views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While I respect their strongly held beliefs, I think their perspectives might be a tad antiquated in some respects. A slight adjustment towards more contemporary thought could potentially alleviate concerns over their decreasing following.\n\nIt's clear that many individuals are beginning to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these issues. For example, those who advocate for abortion or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable adhering to a faith that condemns these practices. Similarly, some might find it difficult to align with a church that opposes their personal beliefs in such areas. Notably, I do not see any intrinsic reason why female priests or married priests should not be permitted, although I am uncertain if these changes would have prevented past occurrences. Ultimately, these matters remain uncertain, and it's challenging to determine whether married or female priests would have made a difference in the past.\n\nMoreover, the idea that priests are devoted to God alone seems to overlook the reality of other people and responsibilities in their lives. Most individuals in the world have both a career and a family life, and it appears that priests should be no exception. The notion that priests are \"married to God\" does not preclude them from also having a family or a personal life.",
            "To be quite candid, I harbor no qualms about same-sex unions. I strongly believe that one's inclination towards a particular gender isn't a conscious choice. If one is born into this orientation, it's not something that should be held against them. It seems inequitable to permit heterosexual couples to marry while denying the same privilege to couples of the same sex. It's not something I've extensively pondered, but I'd assert it's unjust to make such a distinction. In my view, the federal government should refrain from meddling in this matter, as it's not a security or moral issue. It's simply about respecting individuals' identities and choices.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, as there aren't compelling reasons to the contrary. Many individuals contend that these unions undermine traditional, heterosexual families, but this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of relationships. It's akin to comparing two different sides of a coin; though distinct, they represent the same fundamental principle. Numerous civil rights are at stake, including property ownership and healthcare, where partners in same-sex relationships may not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. Furthermore, scientific research indicates that same-sex couples exhibit comparable success rates and satisfaction levels in their relationships. The crux of the matter is that homosexual couples are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, independent of religious ceremonies. Allowing civil unions but not marriage is analogous to segregation, as both forms of relationships share numerous similarities. Concerns about adoption and community impact are genuine, yet these issues are also present in heterosexual families. Children raised by same-sex parents often face judgment from peers and adults, a situation that can be mitigated through supportive environments and comprehensive education. I maintain that the federal government should federally legalize same-sex marriage, reversing the current amendment. However, President Bush's stance on this issue appears to be driven by religious beliefs, paralleling his positions on other moral issues like abortion and stem cell research. While I try to avoid politics, I believe that imposing religious morality on the government is inherently unethical and hypocritical, given recent controversies surrounding religious symbols and their place in public life. Additionally, the idea that homosexuals are psychologically damaged or traumatized is unfounded, as confirmed by the American Psychological Association. It's crucial to rely on research from credible institutions rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "During the summer months, I was employed in a hospital pharmacy. You see, merely because a substance is deemed illicit does not imply it possesses inherent benefits, especially when considering its availability to the public. While I do not advocate for its widespread accessibility, I am of the opinion that if used medicinally, it could be considered. Quite simply, being illegal does not equate to its lack of beneficial properties. In fact, many pharmacies utilize controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are acknowledged for their medicinal value.\n\nHowever, one must tread carefully when discussing such a topic. While I am not suggesting marijuana to be the same as alcohol, both can have negative consequences when abused. The key lies in gradual integration, rather than immediate legalization, to prevent misuse. The taboo surrounding marijuana must first be addressed to allow for responsible use.\n\nI believe the negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. It is not as harmful as other substances like heroin or cocaine. If we can shift the public's image of marijuana from a harmful, illicit drug to a more responsible perspective, it can be utilized for medicinal purposes. This, however, remains a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "Over the years, I've observed that the church has evolved to accommodate the modern world. The once rigid structure has loosened, and the atmosphere has become more relaxed. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with formal attire, including the cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses that were a part of our private school's dress code. However, as I've grown older, the church has adapted, introducing a shorter, more casual mass for teenagers, reducing the ceremony to just thirty minutes, and allowing more casual attire, especially during the summer. Families are often seen rushing in late, and beachwear is not uncommon. Even the morning masses, where formal attire was once the norm, now see a shift towards jeans and khakis. I have noticed this change most prominently, but the church's stance on other issues remains unclear to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and the issue of pedophilia, I believe that these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. I've seen married men who still have these issues, and I believe it stems from their genetics, not from their marital status. I think that individuals with these tendencies are often born with them, and they don't change due to marital status. The church, in this case, might not have been able to prevent these incidents, especially if they were trying to cover them up. I don't believe the church could have done much more to prevent these issues, as they are largely out of their control.",
            "** Initially, I was somewhat amenable to the idea, but upon reflection, I believe the collective trauma from the September 11th attacks led us to a hasty decision. The administration's rationale for the Iraq war was tenuous at best, with links to al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction now proven false. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding the Iraq war.\n\nMoreover, the Bush administration's lack of transparency and accountability in their claims is disturbing. Even General Colin Powell, who once championed the case, has since expressed doubting the evidence presented to the UN. Such willful ignorance of the facts strikes me as a flagrant disregard for the constitution and an impeachable offense.\n\nThere's a sense that the Bush administration entered office with an overwhelming desire for retribution against Iraq and a hidden agenda to secure energy resources, which is fundamentally underhanded. Nevertheless, a sudden withdrawal could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war and a higher death toll.\n\nThe alternative proposal—an international coalition involving Syria and Saudi Arabia—seems equally dubious. I'm concerned that long-term stability may be compromised due to ongoing sovereignty issues. The interim government appears ineffective, with the Prime Minister wielding little control and radical factions vying for power. The political landscape is fraught with tension, and the situation is far from resolved.\n\n**",

            "I must express my strong displeasure with the notion of legalizing this particular practice, let alone having a state endorse it. I firmly believe that the matter is best left in the hands of religious institutions, as the Constitution itself mandates a separation of church and state. This principle is explicitly outlined and should not be tampered with. Attempting to impose a legal stance on this issue would undoubtedly be a disregard of the established guidelines and a direct challenge to the Constitution.\n\nIn essence, I feel that those advocating for its illegality are essentially imposing their own religious beliefs onto others, particularly since the majority of Catholics and Christians are opposed to it. I maintain that the government should neither support nor denounce a religious practice. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our nation's constitution, promoting religious tolerance and freedom. Altering this fundamental principle with an amendment would be both incorrect and unprecedented.\n\nI firmly believe that the federal government should steer clear of this issue. The President's push for this amendment seems to stem from his personal religious convictions, which I consider to be a preference for Catholicism over other faiths. I argue that the amendment is not motivated by any substantial reasoning beyond personal beliefs, as its impact on the economy or society at large is minimal, and potentially even beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my assertion that this matter is best left to the discretion of religious institutions, not the government.",
            "The conflict in Iraq raises numerous concerns regarding the government's transparency with the public about the war's justification. Initially, I question the government's candor regarding the war's initiation, as it appeared to exploit the emotions stirred by the 9/11 attacks. The administration's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, despite their tenuous connection, exacerbated public sentiment against the government. The war's commencement in 2003 was a preemptive strike, and I strongly opposed such an approach. The Iraqi war, in many respects, echoed the Vietnam War, with the government not adequately anticipating the consequences of removing a country's government and establishing a new one.\n\nThe loss of American soldiers is profoundly sorrowful, and the repercussions of the invasion were not foreseen or prepared for by the government. The void of power and subsequent chaos that followed were not adequately addressed. The United States' intervention aimed to implant a democratic government, similar to its efforts in Vietnam, but this was also an ambitious endeavor that would not yield swift success. The government's lack of preparedness for the aftermath, and its initial optimism about a swift victory, were misguided. The war's duration and the ongoing risks to American troops demonstrate the government's underestimation of the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining a democratic regime.\n\nThe ethical dilemma persists, even as the war enters its fifth year. Should the United States remain committed to its intervention, given the potential risks and the ongoing operations to train Iraqi troops and police? The decision to invade Iraq raises questions about the government's motivations, particularly regarding oil resources. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the initial claims, and the contrasting inaction against North Korea, where such weapons are present, casts doubt on the government's rationale for the war. Ultimately, while I hope for a peaceful resolution in Iraq, the likelihood of a swift conclusion seems remote.",
            "I've always been a proponent of same-sex marriage. I believe it to be a matter of personal choice, and recent scientific research suggests that it may have biological underpinnings, rather than being solely the result of societal influences. I think it's inhumane to deny rights to individuals based on something they can't control. Historically, my community has included same-sex couples who've raised families alongside heterosexual ones. These families operate similarly, and it's absurd to suggest that their unions are any less valid or important. I'm against the government's involvement in this personal decision. I'm not convinced that the political climate should dictate who can and cannot marry. Marriage should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle.",
            "When I place something online, it's quite clear that it becomes accessible to the public sphere. It is entirely public. As an R.A., I have personally encountered issues stemming from this. When content is shared, it can significantly influence how others perceive you. If, for instance, you mention explosives or shootings, someone is bound to react. Such content should be refrained from being shared in the public domain. The internet, after all, is visible to everyone. If you're friends with an individual on social platforms like Myspace, you'll receive updates from them. It isn't the school that receives such notifications; rather, someone else does so and reports it. When such information reaches the school, they must address it promptly, as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic outcomes. However, distinguishing between playful banter and serious threats can be challenging. As our school once experienced, a seemingly humorous remark could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat. When shared online, privacy is essentially non-existent. If you wish to maintain privacy, refrain from sharing personal information. You cannot control others' perceptions or how they interpret your content. While I don't believe school officials should be monitoring students' social media, if the information is brought to their attention, there is no invasion of privacy. The school must handle potential dangers seriously, especially when they are reported. I, for example, avoid befriending residents on social media to prevent seeing personal content, such as images from parties, which could deter my ability to maintain a neutral position.",
            "The conflict seems to have persisted for much longer than necessary. Initially, the intention was commendable, aiming to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have since deviated from this noble goal. The extension of the war appears to be more about asserting our global supremacy than about the stated objective. I must also consider that personal animosities, potentially stemming from the previous administration's disputes with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to engage in this war.\n\nThe primary objective of installing a democratic government in a tyrannical state could be deemed justifiable. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict suggests a departure from this original purpose. It feels as though we are now engaged in a never-ending war, driven by a desire to achieve a decisive victory. This persistent involvement is not only emotionally taxing but also financially burdensome.\n\nThe endless expenditure on this war, draining our economy, is particularly concerning. Our nation faces substantial issues such as poverty and infrastructure development that desperately require funding. Instead, billions are being allocated to a conflict that has long since lost its justification.\n\nI believe it is high time we reassess our priorities and end this drawn-out conflict. The Iraqi government must now take responsibility for its own security and governance. Our resources should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic challenges. It is unjustifiable to continue funding a war that has lost its original impetus, especially when there are pressing needs at home.",
            "Could I just clarify something?\n\nWell, it seems someone accessed information online and discovered that certain individuals were engaged in questionable activities. Is that correct?\n\nOf course, the concern about privacy is valid. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, when you post information, it becomes available to a broad audience, even if it's only accessible to those who are friends with you. In a sense, you're granting them permission to view your profile. However, it's important to note that posting anything online means accepting that it might be seen by many.\n\nTo address the issue, it's challenging to have someone continuously monitor all students' profiles. Moreover, it could be seen as discriminatory if only certain students are targeted. But if the discovery was made during a specific investigation, it's understandable. The situation demands context.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I'm always cautious of people who might misuse the information I share. I've seen examples on TV where people can easily access personal details and manipulate others. I've had similar experiences in my classes - strangers knowing my interests, schedule, and friends. It's a delicate balance: I want to communicate with my friends but also protect my privacy.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that her high school had banned Myspace for students, which I found unusual. I'm unsure if that falls under privacy concerns or if the school had the authority to implement such a rule. It's a complex issue, and I'm not certain how to resolve it.",
            "To address the Iraq War, I must preface by noting that I feel an inherent conflict in discussing the topic, given the public sentiment I've personally witnessed. I hesitate to align with the chorus of initial dissent, as it's no longer a primary concern. Nevertheless, the general consensus, both domestic and international, has been overwhelmingly negative. A staggering seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including eight out of ten Iraqis and seven out of ten U.S. troops stationed there, believe the war was a mistake and advocate for our withdrawal within the next year.\n\nHistorically, the Iraq War has been a fiasco, both before and after our involvement. Withdrawing presents its own set of challenges, but staying indefinitely seems unwarranted. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is vast and deeply rooted. The idea that we can impose our democratic ideals on these nations is not only naïve but also disrespectful of their unique cultural identity.\n\nSaddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly tyrannical, but the benefits of deposing him must be weighed against the potential drawbacks of invasion. The situation post-invasion has been compared to quicksand, with Iraq descending into chaos and instability. I struggle to find a compelling reason to continue our presence there, given the overwhelming evidence that the Iraqis themselves want us to leave.\n\nThe administration may have hopeful reasons for prolonging our involvement, but they have yet to present a convincing case. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be an acceptable solution, but immediate withdrawal seems the most logical and compassionate course of action. After all, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, and a quarter wish for an immediate departure. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and their voices should be respected.\n\nIn the event of a withdrawal, if Iraq deteriorates, we can at least point to the Iraqis' decision as the catalyst, and if we decide to intervene later, our intentions would be more genuine. While we may never be seen as heroes in the Middle East, leaving now would be better than our current stance. Simply put, it's time to consider a complete exit strategy.",
            "Indeed, it's undeniable that gender discrimination persists in the United States, extending beyond merely gender and encompassing the specific domain of employment. This bias is not confined to just women; it also affects men and individuals in various other fields, such as fashion or parenting.\n\nIt's quite common, for instance, to encounter situations where a woman is qualified for a position but is not promoted due to historical biases against women in leadership roles. Similarly, a man might face prejudice if he chooses to stay at home to raise his children, as societal expectations often dictate that men are the primary financial providers. In the fashion industry, a man might be dismissed or doubted due to societal perceptions of gender roles and interests.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't confined to gender but also occurs due to one's background or area of origin. For example, someone who grew up on a farm might be overlooked for a high-level position despite their intelligence because of their grammar and accent. These biases highlight the need for continued efforts to address discrimination in all its forms.",
            "In my interpretation, the matter was not explicitly legalized, but rather decriminalized. This shift demoted it from a criminal infraction to a lesser offense, akin to receiving a traffic citation. When someone is apprehended for this, the resultant effects on job prospects and future endeavors, often the most severe they can be, are significantly mitigated. Indeed, while marijuana-related apprehensions may still carry some stigma, the financial burden on communities is considerable. The costs associated with prosecution, incarceration, and legal representation can be substantial. Therefore, many financially distressed communities may be reluctant to adopt such reforms. However, in more liberal environments, such as Denver, this approach can yield significant benefits, including increased funding for education, social programs, and support for vulnerable populations. While open drug use is not universally embraced, the financial implications of decriminalization cannot be ignored. I believe that the societal acceptance of marijuana is a multifaceted issue, and its impact on a community's finances is one critical aspect. Like many substances, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals able to exercise moderation while others may not. Therefore, I do not think it is possible to make generalized statements about the effects of marijuana.",
            "I would say indeed\nAs\nA good deal of their methods are quite conventional\nHaving persisted over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's commendable to remain steadfast in tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible in the face of change\nA notion\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly churchgoing\nAnd\nThey are quite stringent about adhering to their rituals\nSometimes\nI sense a certain disdain for those who do not strictly follow their beliefs\nAnd\nThey seem to reject those who are not perfectly aligned with their doctrine\nOr\nThose belonging to other faiths\nFor instance\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nI apologize\nMy mother was an Episcopalian\nMy father was a Catholic\nAnd they declined to marry them in the Catholic Church\nDue to my father's faith\n\nAnd\nThis isn't truly\nReflective of\nTolerance towards other religions\nWe were always taught to\nEssentially\nLove one another\nA core Catholic tenet\nYet\nIt's contradictory to preach love and simultaneously reject those who do not conform\n\nSo\nI believe many of the Catholic teachings advocate for certain actions\nBut the actual practice often falls short\nDue to its antiquated nature\nYet they persist in maintaining it\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily alter this\nI mean\nI personally believe priests should be allowed to marry\nBut\nI don't think it would essentially deter them from\nPedophilic tendencies\nAs it's a different realm\nIt might not make a difference\nBut I doubt it would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPedophiles may still act that way\nWhether they have a spouse or not\nBecause the nature of the act is different\nSo if they choose to engage in such behavior\nThey likely would, regardless of their marital status\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such acts\nI believe it would happen regardless",

            "I hail from a household steeped in Christian tradition, which has made the topic of homosexuality somewhat ambiguous for me. I have several homosexual friends, and while I may not fully comprehend or align with their lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be legalized. This issue, I contend, should not be a national concern, but rather a matter decided by individual states. After all, a multitude of states lean towards Democratic ideals, which would naturally support gay marriage, while others adhere to Republican values and may not. Thus, one should not dispute the decision of a state where they choose to reside, as it reflects their own ideological alignment. Consequently, the Federal government, including the President, should not impose their will on the matter. I maintain that each state should have the autonomy to decide, as they are the ones who will bear the consequences of their decision. This autonomy is all the more crucial given the brevity of the current president's term, which will soon be succeeded by a new administration with potentially differing views. It is, therefore, logical to cede this decision to the states, as they are the ones who will live with the ramifications of their choice.",

            "Initially, when the war began, I was quite enthusiastic due to the personal impact of the September 11th tragedy. I was driven by a desire to inflict similar chaos as was inflicted upon us. However, with hindsight, I believe we overlooked long-term consequences and entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan. The war ultimately backfired, and our involvement has proven ineffective. My perspective has shifted significantly since then. I now believe that our presence does not hinder the internal strife in the region. As long as they are occupied with their own conflicts, they do not pose a threat to us. My earlier infatuation with the idea of retaliation has subsided, and I now advocate for withdrawal. The war was initially driven by emotion and a desire for revenge, with little consideration for the potential ramifications. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was understandable, given the circumstances, but I contend that we could have adopted a more strategic approach. Our lack of clear objectives and unity only hindered our efforts. The people we sought to transform are, in my opinion, inherently resistant to change. Our prolonged involvement is futile, and the region's instability will persist regardless of our presence. It is in our best interest to disengage and focus on our own affairs."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It seems evident that the Catholic Church could benefit from some reconsideration in their stance on certain issues. Various interpretations have been made about the church's dwindling membership, and I believe it's due, in part, to their sometimes rigid views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While I respect their strongly held beliefs, I think their perspectives might be a tad antiquated in some respects. A slight adjustment towards more contemporary thought could potentially alleviate concerns over their decreasing following.\n\nIt's clear that many individuals are beginning to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these issues. For example, those who advocate for abortion or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable adhering to a faith that condemns these practices. Similarly, some might find it difficult to align with a church that opposes their personal beliefs in such areas. Notably, I do not see any intrinsic reason why female priests or married priests should not be permitted, although I am uncertain if these changes would have prevented past occurrences. Ultimately, these matters remain uncertain, and it's challenging to determine whether married or female priests would have made a difference in the past.\n\nMoreover, the idea that priests are devoted to God alone seems to overlook the reality of other people and responsibilities in their lives. Most individuals in the world have both a career and a family life, and it appears that priests should be no exception. The notion that priests are \"married to God\" does not preclude them from also having a family or a personal life.",
            "To be quite candid, I harbor no qualms about same-sex unions. I strongly believe that one's inclination towards a particular gender isn't a conscious choice. If one is born into this orientation, it's not something that should be held against them. It seems inequitable to permit heterosexual couples to marry while denying the same privilege to couples of the same sex. It's not something I've extensively pondered, but I'd assert it's unjust to make such a distinction. In my view, the federal government should refrain from meddling in this matter, as it's not a security or moral issue. It's simply about respecting individuals' identities and choices.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, as there aren't compelling reasons to the contrary. Many individuals contend that these unions undermine traditional, heterosexual families, but this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of relationships. It's akin to comparing two different sides of a coin; though distinct, they represent the same fundamental principle. Numerous civil rights are at stake, including property ownership and healthcare, where partners in same-sex relationships may not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. Furthermore, scientific research indicates that same-sex couples exhibit comparable success rates and satisfaction levels in their relationships. The crux of the matter is that homosexual couples are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, independent of religious ceremonies. Allowing civil unions but not marriage is analogous to segregation, as both forms of relationships share numerous similarities. Concerns about adoption and community impact are genuine, yet these issues are also present in heterosexual families. Children raised by same-sex parents often face judgment from peers and adults, a situation that can be mitigated through supportive environments and comprehensive education. I maintain that the federal government should federally legalize same-sex marriage, reversing the current amendment. However, President Bush's stance on this issue appears to be driven by religious beliefs, paralleling his positions on other moral issues like abortion and stem cell research. While I try to avoid politics, I believe that imposing religious morality on the government is inherently unethical and hypocritical, given recent controversies surrounding religious symbols and their place in public life. Additionally, the idea that homosexuals are psychologically damaged or traumatized is unfounded, as confirmed by the American Psychological Association. It's crucial to rely on research from credible institutions rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "During the summer months, I was employed in a hospital pharmacy. You see, merely because a substance is deemed illicit does not imply it possesses inherent benefits, especially when considering its availability to the public. While I do not advocate for its widespread accessibility, I am of the opinion that if used medicinally, it could be considered. Quite simply, being illegal does not equate to its lack of beneficial properties. In fact, many pharmacies utilize controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are acknowledged for their medicinal value.\n\nHowever, one must tread carefully when discussing such a topic. While I am not suggesting marijuana to be the same as alcohol, both can have negative consequences when abused. The key lies in gradual integration, rather than immediate legalization, to prevent misuse. The taboo surrounding marijuana must first be addressed to allow for responsible use.\n\nI believe the negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. It is not as harmful as other substances like heroin or cocaine. If we can shift the public's image of marijuana from a harmful, illicit drug to a more responsible perspective, it can be utilized for medicinal purposes. This, however, remains a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "Over the years, I've observed that the church has evolved to accommodate the modern world. The once rigid structure has loosened, and the atmosphere has become more relaxed. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with formal attire, including the cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses that were a part of our private school's dress code. However, as I've grown older, the church has adapted, introducing a shorter, more casual mass for teenagers, reducing the ceremony to just thirty minutes, and allowing more casual attire, especially during the summer. Families are often seen rushing in late, and beachwear is not uncommon. Even the morning masses, where formal attire was once the norm, now see a shift towards jeans and khakis. I have noticed this change most prominently, but the church's stance on other issues remains unclear to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and the issue of pedophilia, I believe that these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. I've seen married men who still have these issues, and I believe it stems from their genetics, not from their marital status. I think that individuals with these tendencies are often born with them, and they don't change due to marital status. The church, in this case, might not have been able to prevent these incidents, especially if they were trying to cover them up. I don't believe the church could have done much more to prevent these issues, as they are largely out of their control.",
            "** Initially, I was somewhat amenable to the idea, but upon reflection, I believe the collective trauma from the September 11th attacks led us to a hasty decision. The administration's rationale for the Iraq war was tenuous at best, with links to al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction now proven false. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding the Iraq war.\n\nMoreover, the Bush administration's lack of transparency and accountability in their claims is disturbing. Even General Colin Powell, who once championed the case, has since expressed doubting the evidence presented to the UN. Such willful ignorance of the facts strikes me as a flagrant disregard for the constitution and an impeachable offense.\n\nThere's a sense that the Bush administration entered office with an overwhelming desire for retribution against Iraq and a hidden agenda to secure energy resources, which is fundamentally underhanded. Nevertheless, a sudden withdrawal could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war and a higher death toll.\n\nThe alternative proposal—an international coalition involving Syria and Saudi Arabia—seems equally dubious. I'm concerned that long-term stability may be compromised due to ongoing sovereignty issues. The interim government appears ineffective, with the Prime Minister wielding little control and radical factions vying for power. The political landscape is fraught with tension, and the situation is far from resolved.\n\n**",

            "I must express my strong displeasure with the notion of legalizing this particular practice, let alone having a state endorse it. I firmly believe that the matter is best left in the hands of religious institutions, as the Constitution itself mandates a separation of church and state. This principle is explicitly outlined and should not be tampered with. Attempting to impose a legal stance on this issue would undoubtedly be a disregard of the established guidelines and a direct challenge to the Constitution.\n\nIn essence, I feel that those advocating for its illegality are essentially imposing their own religious beliefs onto others, particularly since the majority of Catholics and Christians are opposed to it. I maintain that the government should neither support nor denounce a religious practice. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our nation's constitution, promoting religious tolerance and freedom. Altering this fundamental principle with an amendment would be both incorrect and unprecedented.\n\nI firmly believe that the federal government should steer clear of this issue. The President's push for this amendment seems to stem from his personal religious convictions, which I consider to be a preference for Catholicism over other faiths. I argue that the amendment is not motivated by any substantial reasoning beyond personal beliefs, as its impact on the economy or society at large is minimal, and potentially even beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my assertion that this matter is best left to the discretion of religious institutions, not the government.",
            "The conflict in Iraq raises numerous concerns regarding the government's transparency with the public about the war's justification. Initially, I question the government's candor regarding the war's initiation, as it appeared to exploit the emotions stirred by the 9/11 attacks. The administration's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, despite their tenuous connection, exacerbated public sentiment against the government. The war's commencement in 2003 was a preemptive strike, and I strongly opposed such an approach. The Iraqi war, in many respects, echoed the Vietnam War, with the government not adequately anticipating the consequences of removing a country's government and establishing a new one.\n\nThe loss of American soldiers is profoundly sorrowful, and the repercussions of the invasion were not foreseen or prepared for by the government. The void of power and subsequent chaos that followed were not adequately addressed. The United States' intervention aimed to implant a democratic government, similar to its efforts in Vietnam, but this was also an ambitious endeavor that would not yield swift success. The government's lack of preparedness for the aftermath, and its initial optimism about a swift victory, were misguided. The war's duration and the ongoing risks to American troops demonstrate the government's underestimation of the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining a democratic regime.\n\nThe ethical dilemma persists, even as the war enters its fifth year. Should the United States remain committed to its intervention, given the potential risks and the ongoing operations to train Iraqi troops and police? The decision to invade Iraq raises questions about the government's motivations, particularly regarding oil resources. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the initial claims, and the contrasting inaction against North Korea, where such weapons are present, casts doubt on the government's rationale for the war. Ultimately, while I hope for a peaceful resolution in Iraq, the likelihood of a swift conclusion seems remote.",
            "I've always been a proponent of same-sex marriage. I believe it to be a matter of personal choice, and recent scientific research suggests that it may have biological underpinnings, rather than being solely the result of societal influences. I think it's inhumane to deny rights to individuals based on something they can't control. Historically, my community has included same-sex couples who've raised families alongside heterosexual ones. These families operate similarly, and it's absurd to suggest that their unions are any less valid or important. I'm against the government's involvement in this personal decision. I'm not convinced that the political climate should dictate who can and cannot marry. Marriage should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle.",
            "When I place something online, it's quite clear that it becomes accessible to the public sphere. It is entirely public. As an R.A., I have personally encountered issues stemming from this. When content is shared, it can significantly influence how others perceive you. If, for instance, you mention explosives or shootings, someone is bound to react. Such content should be refrained from being shared in the public domain. The internet, after all, is visible to everyone. If you're friends with an individual on social platforms like Myspace, you'll receive updates from them. It isn't the school that receives such notifications; rather, someone else does so and reports it. When such information reaches the school, they must address it promptly, as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic outcomes. However, distinguishing between playful banter and serious threats can be challenging. As our school once experienced, a seemingly humorous remark could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat. When shared online, privacy is essentially non-existent. If you wish to maintain privacy, refrain from sharing personal information. You cannot control others' perceptions or how they interpret your content. While I don't believe school officials should be monitoring students' social media, if the information is brought to their attention, there is no invasion of privacy. The school must handle potential dangers seriously, especially when they are reported. I, for example, avoid befriending residents on social media to prevent seeing personal content, such as images from parties, which could deter my ability to maintain a neutral position.",
            "The conflict seems to have persisted for much longer than necessary. Initially, the intention was commendable, aiming to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have since deviated from this noble goal. The extension of the war appears to be more about asserting our global supremacy than about the stated objective. I must also consider that personal animosities, potentially stemming from the previous administration's disputes with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to engage in this war.\n\nThe primary objective of installing a democratic government in a tyrannical state could be deemed justifiable. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict suggests a departure from this original purpose. It feels as though we are now engaged in a never-ending war, driven by a desire to achieve a decisive victory. This persistent involvement is not only emotionally taxing but also financially burdensome.\n\nThe endless expenditure on this war, draining our economy, is particularly concerning. Our nation faces substantial issues such as poverty and infrastructure development that desperately require funding. Instead, billions are being allocated to a conflict that has long since lost its justification.\n\nI believe it is high time we reassess our priorities and end this drawn-out conflict. The Iraqi government must now take responsibility for its own security and governance. Our resources should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic challenges. It is unjustifiable to continue funding a war that has lost its original impetus, especially when there are pressing needs at home.",
            "Could I just clarify something?\n\nWell, it seems someone accessed information online and discovered that certain individuals were engaged in questionable activities. Is that correct?\n\nOf course, the concern about privacy is valid. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, when you post information, it becomes available to a broad audience, even if it's only accessible to those who are friends with you. In a sense, you're granting them permission to view your profile. However, it's important to note that posting anything online means accepting that it might be seen by many.\n\nTo address the issue, it's challenging to have someone continuously monitor all students' profiles. Moreover, it could be seen as discriminatory if only certain students are targeted. But if the discovery was made during a specific investigation, it's understandable. The situation demands context.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I'm always cautious of people who might misuse the information I share. I've seen examples on TV where people can easily access personal details and manipulate others. I've had similar experiences in my classes - strangers knowing my interests, schedule, and friends. It's a delicate balance: I want to communicate with my friends but also protect my privacy.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that her high school had banned Myspace for students, which I found unusual. I'm unsure if that falls under privacy concerns or if the school had the authority to implement such a rule. It's a complex issue, and I'm not certain how to resolve it.",
            "To address the Iraq War, I must preface by noting that I feel an inherent conflict in discussing the topic, given the public sentiment I've personally witnessed. I hesitate to align with the chorus of initial dissent, as it's no longer a primary concern. Nevertheless, the general consensus, both domestic and international, has been overwhelmingly negative. A staggering seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including eight out of ten Iraqis and seven out of ten U.S. troops stationed there, believe the war was a mistake and advocate for our withdrawal within the next year.\n\nHistorically, the Iraq War has been a fiasco, both before and after our involvement. Withdrawing presents its own set of challenges, but staying indefinitely seems unwarranted. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is vast and deeply rooted. The idea that we can impose our democratic ideals on these nations is not only naïve but also disrespectful of their unique cultural identity.\n\nSaddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly tyrannical, but the benefits of deposing him must be weighed against the potential drawbacks of invasion. The situation post-invasion has been compared to quicksand, with Iraq descending into chaos and instability. I struggle to find a compelling reason to continue our presence there, given the overwhelming evidence that the Iraqis themselves want us to leave.\n\nThe administration may have hopeful reasons for prolonging our involvement, but they have yet to present a convincing case. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be an acceptable solution, but immediate withdrawal seems the most logical and compassionate course of action. After all, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, and a quarter wish for an immediate departure. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and their voices should be respected.\n\nIn the event of a withdrawal, if Iraq deteriorates, we can at least point to the Iraqis' decision as the catalyst, and if we decide to intervene later, our intentions would be more genuine. While we may never be seen as heroes in the Middle East, leaving now would be better than our current stance. Simply put, it's time to consider a complete exit strategy.",
            "Indeed, it's undeniable that gender discrimination persists in the United States, extending beyond merely gender and encompassing the specific domain of employment. This bias is not confined to just women; it also affects men and individuals in various other fields, such as fashion or parenting.\n\nIt's quite common, for instance, to encounter situations where a woman is qualified for a position but is not promoted due to historical biases against women in leadership roles. Similarly, a man might face prejudice if he chooses to stay at home to raise his children, as societal expectations often dictate that men are the primary financial providers. In the fashion industry, a man might be dismissed or doubted due to societal perceptions of gender roles and interests.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't confined to gender but also occurs due to one's background or area of origin. For example, someone who grew up on a farm might be overlooked for a high-level position despite their intelligence because of their grammar and accent. These biases highlight the need for continued efforts to address discrimination in all its forms.",
            "In my interpretation, the matter was not explicitly legalized, but rather decriminalized. This shift demoted it from a criminal infraction to a lesser offense, akin to receiving a traffic citation. When someone is apprehended for this, the resultant effects on job prospects and future endeavors, often the most severe they can be, are significantly mitigated. Indeed, while marijuana-related apprehensions may still carry some stigma, the financial burden on communities is considerable. The costs associated with prosecution, incarceration, and legal representation can be substantial. Therefore, many financially distressed communities may be reluctant to adopt such reforms. However, in more liberal environments, such as Denver, this approach can yield significant benefits, including increased funding for education, social programs, and support for vulnerable populations. While open drug use is not universally embraced, the financial implications of decriminalization cannot be ignored. I believe that the societal acceptance of marijuana is a multifaceted issue, and its impact on a community's finances is one critical aspect. Like many substances, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals able to exercise moderation while others may not. Therefore, I do not think it is possible to make generalized statements about the effects of marijuana.",
            "I would say indeed\nAs\nA good deal of their methods are quite conventional\nHaving persisted over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's commendable to remain steadfast in tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible in the face of change\nA notion\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly churchgoing\nAnd\nThey are quite stringent about adhering to their rituals\nSometimes\nI sense a certain disdain for those who do not strictly follow their beliefs\nAnd\nThey seem to reject those who are not perfectly aligned with their doctrine\nOr\nThose belonging to other faiths\nFor instance\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nI apologize\nMy mother was an Episcopalian\nMy father was a Catholic\nAnd they declined to marry them in the Catholic Church\nDue to my father's faith\n\nAnd\nThis isn't truly\nReflective of\nTolerance towards other religions\nWe were always taught to\nEssentially\nLove one another\nA core Catholic tenet\nYet\nIt's contradictory to preach love and simultaneously reject those who do not conform\n\nSo\nI believe many of the Catholic teachings advocate for certain actions\nBut the actual practice often falls short\nDue to its antiquated nature\nYet they persist in maintaining it\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily alter this\nI mean\nI personally believe priests should be allowed to marry\nBut\nI don't think it would essentially deter them from\nPedophilic tendencies\nAs it's a different realm\nIt might not make a difference\nBut I doubt it would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPedophiles may still act that way\nWhether they have a spouse or not\nBecause the nature of the act is different\nSo if they choose to engage in such behavior\nThey likely would, regardless of their marital status\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such acts\nI believe it would happen regardless",

            "I hail from a household steeped in Christian tradition, which has made the topic of homosexuality somewhat ambiguous for me. I have several homosexual friends, and while I may not fully comprehend or align with their lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be legalized. This issue, I contend, should not be a national concern, but rather a matter decided by individual states. After all, a multitude of states lean towards Democratic ideals, which would naturally support gay marriage, while others adhere to Republican values and may not. Thus, one should not dispute the decision of a state where they choose to reside, as it reflects their own ideological alignment. Consequently, the Federal government, including the President, should not impose their will on the matter. I maintain that each state should have the autonomy to decide, as they are the ones who will bear the consequences of their decision. This autonomy is all the more crucial given the brevity of the current president's term, which will soon be succeeded by a new administration with potentially differing views. It is, therefore, logical to cede this decision to the states, as they are the ones who will live with the ramifications of their choice.",

            "Initially, when the war began, I was quite enthusiastic due to the personal impact of the September 11th tragedy. I was driven by a desire to inflict similar chaos as was inflicted upon us. However, with hindsight, I believe we overlooked long-term consequences and entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan. The war ultimately backfired, and our involvement has proven ineffective. My perspective has shifted significantly since then. I now believe that our presence does not hinder the internal strife in the region. As long as they are occupied with their own conflicts, they do not pose a threat to us. My earlier infatuation with the idea of retaliation has subsided, and I now advocate for withdrawal. The war was initially driven by emotion and a desire for revenge, with little consideration for the potential ramifications. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was understandable, given the circumstances, but I contend that we could have adopted a more strategic approach. Our lack of clear objectives and unity only hindered our efforts. The people we sought to transform are, in my opinion, inherently resistant to change. Our prolonged involvement is futile, and the region's instability will persist regardless of our presence. It is in our best interest to disengage and focus on our own affairs."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "It seems evident that the Catholic Church could benefit from some reconsideration in their stance on certain issues. Various interpretations have been made about the church's dwindling membership, and I believe it's due, in part, to their sometimes rigid views on topics like same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. While I respect their strongly held beliefs, I think their perspectives might be a tad antiquated in some respects. A slight adjustment towards more contemporary thought could potentially alleviate concerns over their decreasing following.\n\nIt's clear that many individuals are beginning to distance themselves from the Catholic Church due to their views on these issues. For example, those who advocate for abortion or same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable adhering to a faith that condemns these practices. Similarly, some might find it difficult to align with a church that opposes their personal beliefs in such areas. Notably, I do not see any intrinsic reason why female priests or married priests should not be permitted, although I am uncertain if these changes would have prevented past occurrences. Ultimately, these matters remain uncertain, and it's challenging to determine whether married or female priests would have made a difference in the past.\n\nMoreover, the idea that priests are devoted to God alone seems to overlook the reality of other people and responsibilities in their lives. Most individuals in the world have both a career and a family life, and it appears that priests should be no exception. The notion that priests are \"married to God\" does not preclude them from also having a family or a personal life.",
            "To be quite candid, I harbor no qualms about same-sex unions. I strongly believe that one's inclination towards a particular gender isn't a conscious choice. If one is born into this orientation, it's not something that should be held against them. It seems inequitable to permit heterosexual couples to marry while denying the same privilege to couples of the same sex. It's not something I've extensively pondered, but I'd assert it's unjust to make such a distinction. In my view, the federal government should refrain from meddling in this matter, as it's not a security or moral issue. It's simply about respecting individuals' identities and choices.",
            "I believe that same-sex marriage should be legalized, as there aren't compelling reasons to the contrary. Many individuals contend that these unions undermine traditional, heterosexual families, but this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of relationships. It's akin to comparing two different sides of a coin; though distinct, they represent the same fundamental principle. Numerous civil rights are at stake, including property ownership and healthcare, where partners in same-sex relationships may not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples. Furthermore, scientific research indicates that same-sex couples exhibit comparable success rates and satisfaction levels in their relationships. The crux of the matter is that homosexual couples are simply requesting a legal marriage certificate, independent of religious ceremonies. Allowing civil unions but not marriage is analogous to segregation, as both forms of relationships share numerous similarities. Concerns about adoption and community impact are genuine, yet these issues are also present in heterosexual families. Children raised by same-sex parents often face judgment from peers and adults, a situation that can be mitigated through supportive environments and comprehensive education. I maintain that the federal government should federally legalize same-sex marriage, reversing the current amendment. However, President Bush's stance on this issue appears to be driven by religious beliefs, paralleling his positions on other moral issues like abortion and stem cell research. While I try to avoid politics, I believe that imposing religious morality on the government is inherently unethical and hypocritical, given recent controversies surrounding religious symbols and their place in public life. Additionally, the idea that homosexuals are psychologically damaged or traumatized is unfounded, as confirmed by the American Psychological Association. It's crucial to rely on research from credible institutions rather than popular opinion or cultural norms.",
            "During the summer months, I was employed in a hospital pharmacy. You see, merely because a substance is deemed illicit does not imply it possesses inherent benefits, especially when considering its availability to the public. While I do not advocate for its widespread accessibility, I am of the opinion that if used medicinally, it could be considered. Quite simply, being illegal does not equate to its lack of beneficial properties. In fact, many pharmacies utilize controlled substances like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet, which are acknowledged for their medicinal value.\n\nHowever, one must tread carefully when discussing such a topic. While I am not suggesting marijuana to be the same as alcohol, both can have negative consequences when abused. The key lies in gradual integration, rather than immediate legalization, to prevent misuse. The taboo surrounding marijuana must first be addressed to allow for responsible use.\n\nI believe the negative perception of marijuana is largely due to its illegal status. It is not as harmful as other substances like heroin or cocaine. If we can shift the public's image of marijuana from a harmful, illicit drug to a more responsible perspective, it can be utilized for medicinal purposes. This, however, remains a complex issue that needs careful consideration.",
            "Over the years, I've observed that the church has evolved to accommodate the modern world. The once rigid structure has loosened, and the atmosphere has become more relaxed. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with formal attire, including the cute dresses, matching shoes, and purses that were a part of our private school's dress code. However, as I've grown older, the church has adapted, introducing a shorter, more casual mass for teenagers, reducing the ceremony to just thirty minutes, and allowing more casual attire, especially during the summer. Families are often seen rushing in late, and beachwear is not uncommon. Even the morning masses, where formal attire was once the norm, now see a shift towards jeans and khakis. I have noticed this change most prominently, but the church's stance on other issues remains unclear to me.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and the issue of pedophilia, I believe that these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. I've seen married men who still have these issues, and I believe it stems from their genetics, not from their marital status. I think that individuals with these tendencies are often born with them, and they don't change due to marital status. The church, in this case, might not have been able to prevent these incidents, especially if they were trying to cover them up. I don't believe the church could have done much more to prevent these issues, as they are largely out of their control.",
            "** Initially, I was somewhat amenable to the idea, but upon reflection, I believe the collective trauma from the September 11th attacks led us to a hasty decision. The administration's rationale for the Iraq war was tenuous at best, with links to al-Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction now proven false. This has left a bitter taste in my mouth regarding the Iraq war.\n\nMoreover, the Bush administration's lack of transparency and accountability in their claims is disturbing. Even General Colin Powell, who once championed the case, has since expressed doubting the evidence presented to the UN. Such willful ignorance of the facts strikes me as a flagrant disregard for the constitution and an impeachable offense.\n\nThere's a sense that the Bush administration entered office with an overwhelming desire for retribution against Iraq and a hidden agenda to secure energy resources, which is fundamentally underhanded. Nevertheless, a sudden withdrawal could exacerbate the situation, potentially leading to a full-blown civil war and a higher death toll.\n\nThe alternative proposal—an international coalition involving Syria and Saudi Arabia—seems equally dubious. I'm concerned that long-term stability may be compromised due to ongoing sovereignty issues. The interim government appears ineffective, with the Prime Minister wielding little control and radical factions vying for power. The political landscape is fraught with tension, and the situation is far from resolved.\n\n**",

            "I must express my strong displeasure with the notion of legalizing this particular practice, let alone having a state endorse it. I firmly believe that the matter is best left in the hands of religious institutions, as the Constitution itself mandates a separation of church and state. This principle is explicitly outlined and should not be tampered with. Attempting to impose a legal stance on this issue would undoubtedly be a disregard of the established guidelines and a direct challenge to the Constitution.\n\nIn essence, I feel that those advocating for its illegality are essentially imposing their own religious beliefs onto others, particularly since the majority of Catholics and Christians are opposed to it. I maintain that the government should neither support nor denounce a religious practice. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our nation's constitution, promoting religious tolerance and freedom. Altering this fundamental principle with an amendment would be both incorrect and unprecedented.\n\nI firmly believe that the federal government should steer clear of this issue. The President's push for this amendment seems to stem from his personal religious convictions, which I consider to be a preference for Catholicism over other faiths. I argue that the amendment is not motivated by any substantial reasoning beyond personal beliefs, as its impact on the economy or society at large is minimal, and potentially even beneficial.\n\nIn conclusion, I stand by my assertion that this matter is best left to the discretion of religious institutions, not the government.",
            "The conflict in Iraq raises numerous concerns regarding the government's transparency with the public about the war's justification. Initially, I question the government's candor regarding the war's initiation, as it appeared to exploit the emotions stirred by the 9/11 attacks. The administration's attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks, despite their tenuous connection, exacerbated public sentiment against the government. The war's commencement in 2003 was a preemptive strike, and I strongly opposed such an approach. The Iraqi war, in many respects, echoed the Vietnam War, with the government not adequately anticipating the consequences of removing a country's government and establishing a new one.\n\nThe loss of American soldiers is profoundly sorrowful, and the repercussions of the invasion were not foreseen or prepared for by the government. The void of power and subsequent chaos that followed were not adequately addressed. The United States' intervention aimed to implant a democratic government, similar to its efforts in Vietnam, but this was also an ambitious endeavor that would not yield swift success. The government's lack of preparedness for the aftermath, and its initial optimism about a swift victory, were misguided. The war's duration and the ongoing risks to American troops demonstrate the government's underestimation of the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining a democratic regime.\n\nThe ethical dilemma persists, even as the war enters its fifth year. Should the United States remain committed to its intervention, given the potential risks and the ongoing operations to train Iraqi troops and police? The decision to invade Iraq raises questions about the government's motivations, particularly regarding oil resources. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, despite the initial claims, and the contrasting inaction against North Korea, where such weapons are present, casts doubt on the government's rationale for the war. Ultimately, while I hope for a peaceful resolution in Iraq, the likelihood of a swift conclusion seems remote.",
            "I've always been a proponent of same-sex marriage. I believe it to be a matter of personal choice, and recent scientific research suggests that it may have biological underpinnings, rather than being solely the result of societal influences. I think it's inhumane to deny rights to individuals based on something they can't control. Historically, my community has included same-sex couples who've raised families alongside heterosexual ones. These families operate similarly, and it's absurd to suggest that their unions are any less valid or important. I'm against the government's involvement in this personal decision. I'm not convinced that the political climate should dictate who can and cannot marry. Marriage should be a private, personal choice, not a public spectacle.",
            "When I place something online, it's quite clear that it becomes accessible to the public sphere. It is entirely public. As an R.A., I have personally encountered issues stemming from this. When content is shared, it can significantly influence how others perceive you. If, for instance, you mention explosives or shootings, someone is bound to react. Such content should be refrained from being shared in the public domain. The internet, after all, is visible to everyone. If you're friends with an individual on social platforms like Myspace, you'll receive updates from them. It isn't the school that receives such notifications; rather, someone else does so and reports it. When such information reaches the school, they must address it promptly, as failure to do so could lead to catastrophic outcomes. However, distinguishing between playful banter and serious threats can be challenging. As our school once experienced, a seemingly humorous remark could be misinterpreted as a genuine threat. When shared online, privacy is essentially non-existent. If you wish to maintain privacy, refrain from sharing personal information. You cannot control others' perceptions or how they interpret your content. While I don't believe school officials should be monitoring students' social media, if the information is brought to their attention, there is no invasion of privacy. The school must handle potential dangers seriously, especially when they are reported. I, for example, avoid befriending residents on social media to prevent seeing personal content, such as images from parties, which could deter my ability to maintain a neutral position.",
            "The conflict seems to have persisted for much longer than necessary. Initially, the intention was commendable, aiming to establish democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, I believe we have since deviated from this noble goal. The extension of the war appears to be more about asserting our global supremacy than about the stated objective. I must also consider that personal animosities, potentially stemming from the previous administration's disputes with Saddam Hussein, may have influenced the decision to engage in this war.\n\nThe primary objective of installing a democratic government in a tyrannical state could be deemed justifiable. However, the prolonged duration of the conflict suggests a departure from this original purpose. It feels as though we are now engaged in a never-ending war, driven by a desire to achieve a decisive victory. This persistent involvement is not only emotionally taxing but also financially burdensome.\n\nThe endless expenditure on this war, draining our economy, is particularly concerning. Our nation faces substantial issues such as poverty and infrastructure development that desperately require funding. Instead, billions are being allocated to a conflict that has long since lost its justification.\n\nI believe it is high time we reassess our priorities and end this drawn-out conflict. The Iraqi government must now take responsibility for its own security and governance. Our resources should be redirected towards addressing our own domestic challenges. It is unjustifiable to continue funding a war that has lost its original impetus, especially when there are pressing needs at home.",
            "Could I just clarify something?\n\nWell, it seems someone accessed information online and discovered that certain individuals were engaged in questionable activities. Is that correct?\n\nOf course, the concern about privacy is valid. For instance, on platforms like Myspace, when you post information, it becomes available to a broad audience, even if it's only accessible to those who are friends with you. In a sense, you're granting them permission to view your profile. However, it's important to note that posting anything online means accepting that it might be seen by many.\n\nTo address the issue, it's challenging to have someone continuously monitor all students' profiles. Moreover, it could be seen as discriminatory if only certain students are targeted. But if the discovery was made during a specific investigation, it's understandable. The situation demands context.\n\nPersonally, I use Facebook but I'm always cautious of people who might misuse the information I share. I've seen examples on TV where people can easily access personal details and manipulate others. I've had similar experiences in my classes - strangers knowing my interests, schedule, and friends. It's a delicate balance: I want to communicate with my friends but also protect my privacy.\n\nMy roommate mentioned that her high school had banned Myspace for students, which I found unusual. I'm unsure if that falls under privacy concerns or if the school had the authority to implement such a rule. It's a complex issue, and I'm not certain how to resolve it.",
            "To address the Iraq War, I must preface by noting that I feel an inherent conflict in discussing the topic, given the public sentiment I've personally witnessed. I hesitate to align with the chorus of initial dissent, as it's no longer a primary concern. Nevertheless, the general consensus, both domestic and international, has been overwhelmingly negative. A staggering seventy-five to eighty percent of the global population, including eight out of ten Iraqis and seven out of ten U.S. troops stationed there, believe the war was a mistake and advocate for our withdrawal within the next year.\n\nHistorically, the Iraq War has been a fiasco, both before and after our involvement. Withdrawing presents its own set of challenges, but staying indefinitely seems unwarranted. The cultural divide between the U.S. and Middle Eastern states is vast and deeply rooted. The idea that we can impose our democratic ideals on these nations is not only naïve but also disrespectful of their unique cultural identity.\n\nSaddam Hussein's regime was undoubtedly tyrannical, but the benefits of deposing him must be weighed against the potential drawbacks of invasion. The situation post-invasion has been compared to quicksand, with Iraq descending into chaos and instability. I struggle to find a compelling reason to continue our presence there, given the overwhelming evidence that the Iraqis themselves want us to leave.\n\nThe administration may have hopeful reasons for prolonging our involvement, but they have yet to present a convincing case. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be an acceptable solution, but immediate withdrawal seems the most logical and compassionate course of action. After all, eighty percent of Iraqis want us gone, and a quarter wish for an immediate departure. These are the people we're supposedly trying to help, and their voices should be respected.\n\nIn the event of a withdrawal, if Iraq deteriorates, we can at least point to the Iraqis' decision as the catalyst, and if we decide to intervene later, our intentions would be more genuine. While we may never be seen as heroes in the Middle East, leaving now would be better than our current stance. Simply put, it's time to consider a complete exit strategy.",
            "Indeed, it's undeniable that gender discrimination persists in the United States, extending beyond merely gender and encompassing the specific domain of employment. This bias is not confined to just women; it also affects men and individuals in various other fields, such as fashion or parenting.\n\nIt's quite common, for instance, to encounter situations where a woman is qualified for a position but is not promoted due to historical biases against women in leadership roles. Similarly, a man might face prejudice if he chooses to stay at home to raise his children, as societal expectations often dictate that men are the primary financial providers. In the fashion industry, a man might be dismissed or doubted due to societal perceptions of gender roles and interests.\n\nMoreover, discrimination isn't confined to gender but also occurs due to one's background or area of origin. For example, someone who grew up on a farm might be overlooked for a high-level position despite their intelligence because of their grammar and accent. These biases highlight the need for continued efforts to address discrimination in all its forms.",
            "In my interpretation, the matter was not explicitly legalized, but rather decriminalized. This shift demoted it from a criminal infraction to a lesser offense, akin to receiving a traffic citation. When someone is apprehended for this, the resultant effects on job prospects and future endeavors, often the most severe they can be, are significantly mitigated. Indeed, while marijuana-related apprehensions may still carry some stigma, the financial burden on communities is considerable. The costs associated with prosecution, incarceration, and legal representation can be substantial. Therefore, many financially distressed communities may be reluctant to adopt such reforms. However, in more liberal environments, such as Denver, this approach can yield significant benefits, including increased funding for education, social programs, and support for vulnerable populations. While open drug use is not universally embraced, the financial implications of decriminalization cannot be ignored. I believe that the societal acceptance of marijuana is a multifaceted issue, and its impact on a community's finances is one critical aspect. Like many substances, the effects of marijuana vary greatly from person to person, with some individuals able to exercise moderation while others may not. Therefore, I do not think it is possible to make generalized statements about the effects of marijuana.",
            "I would say indeed\nAs\nA good deal of their methods are quite conventional\nHaving persisted over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's commendable to remain steadfast in tradition\nBut\nIt's also crucial to be flexible in the face of change\nA notion\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly churchgoing\nAnd\nThey are quite stringent about adhering to their rituals\nSometimes\nI sense a certain disdain for those who do not strictly follow their beliefs\nAnd\nThey seem to reject those who are not perfectly aligned with their doctrine\nOr\nThose belonging to other faiths\nFor instance\nMy father was an Episcopalian\nI apologize\nMy mother was an Episcopalian\nMy father was a Catholic\nAnd they declined to marry them in the Catholic Church\nDue to my father's faith\n\nAnd\nThis isn't truly\nReflective of\nTolerance towards other religions\nWe were always taught to\nEssentially\nLove one another\nA core Catholic tenet\nYet\nIt's contradictory to preach love and simultaneously reject those who do not conform\n\nSo\nI believe many of the Catholic teachings advocate for certain actions\nBut the actual practice often falls short\nDue to its antiquated nature\nYet they persist in maintaining it\n\nIt wouldn't necessarily alter this\nI mean\nI personally believe priests should be allowed to marry\nBut\nI don't think it would essentially deter them from\nPedophilic tendencies\nAs it's a different realm\nIt might not make a difference\nBut I doubt it would be an issue\n\nWell\nLike\nPedophiles may still act that way\nWhether they have a spouse or not\nBecause the nature of the act is different\nSo if they choose to engage in such behavior\nThey likely would, regardless of their marital status\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would prevent such acts\nI believe it would happen regardless",

            "I hail from a household steeped in Christian tradition, which has made the topic of homosexuality somewhat ambiguous for me. I have several homosexual friends, and while I may not fully comprehend or align with their lifestyle, I firmly believe it should be legalized. This issue, I contend, should not be a national concern, but rather a matter decided by individual states. After all, a multitude of states lean towards Democratic ideals, which would naturally support gay marriage, while others adhere to Republican values and may not. Thus, one should not dispute the decision of a state where they choose to reside, as it reflects their own ideological alignment. Consequently, the Federal government, including the President, should not impose their will on the matter. I maintain that each state should have the autonomy to decide, as they are the ones who will bear the consequences of their decision. This autonomy is all the more crucial given the brevity of the current president's term, which will soon be succeeded by a new administration with potentially differing views. It is, therefore, logical to cede this decision to the states, as they are the ones who will live with the ramifications of their choice.",

            "Initially, when the war began, I was quite enthusiastic due to the personal impact of the September 11th tragedy. I was driven by a desire to inflict similar chaos as was inflicted upon us. However, with hindsight, I believe we overlooked long-term consequences and entered the conflict unprepared and without a clear plan. The war ultimately backfired, and our involvement has proven ineffective. My perspective has shifted significantly since then. I now believe that our presence does not hinder the internal strife in the region. As long as they are occupied with their own conflicts, they do not pose a threat to us. My earlier infatuation with the idea of retaliation has subsided, and I now advocate for withdrawal. The war was initially driven by emotion and a desire for revenge, with little consideration for the potential ramifications. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was understandable, given the circumstances, but I contend that we could have adopted a more strategic approach. Our lack of clear objectives and unity only hindered our efforts. The people we sought to transform are, in my opinion, inherently resistant to change. Our prolonged involvement is futile, and the region's instability will persist regardless of our presence. It is in our best interest to disengage and focus on our own affairs."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve. The institution has been grappling with a dwindling number of adherents, and I believe this is largely due to its stringent stances on various social issues. For instance, the Church's position on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception tends to be conservative, which can alienate those who hold opposing views. While these views are deeply ingrained, they may be perceived as outdated. A slight adjustment towards more modern perspectives could potentially mitigate this decline in support. There's a growing segment of the population that's drifting away from the Church due to its viewpoints on these subjects. For example, someone who supports abortion or same-sex marriage may struggle to reconcile these beliefs with the Church's teachings. I am of the opinion that there is no inherent reason why the Church cannot allow female priests or permit priests to marry. While these changes might not have prevented past incidents, they could represent a shift towards a more inclusive and flexible institution. The Church's current policy of requiring celibacy for priests, which it views as a spiritual commitment to God, could, in my opinion, be re-evaluated. Many professionals balance their work with family life and other relationships, so why shouldn't priests be allowed to do the same? However, it's challenging to predict whether such changes would fundamentally alter the Church's behavior in significant ways.",
            "Well, um, I'm not adverse to the idea of same-sex marriage. I mean, I believe that individuals are born with their sexual orientation and I don't think it's something one can necessarily choose. Consequently, I don't believe that gay individuals should be held accountable for their orientation. I find it rather inequitable that a man and a woman can wed, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't really delved deeply into this topic, but I would certainly argue that it's unjust to restrict gay couples from marriage. It's not like they have a choice in their orientation; it's an inherent aspect of their being. I don't believe the federal government should be invested in this matter, as it's not a matter of national security or morals. The government should not interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to who they love. It's simply who they are and they shouldn't be penalized for that. That's my perspective on the matter.",
            "I contend that same-sex marriage ought to be legally recognized. The reasons against it, however, are not compelling. Many argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this perspective is flawed due to the diversity and complexity of relationships. This is akin to viewing heads and tails as distinct entities, even though they are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, numerous civil rights, including property tax benefits and healthcare considerations, are at stake. For instance, the partner of a gay individual may not be permitted to visit in the event of illness, as they are not technically considered family. This seems arbitrary given the commitment such couples share. Scientific research, notably the high rates of relationship satisfaction among homosexual couples, contradicts this notion. Fundamentally, they are requesting a legal document rather than a religious ceremony. Legally recognizing these unions would not breach church-state separation, as it would not involve religious officiation. Segregation and inequality are reminiscent of past policies, and legislation against same-sex marriage is a new form of this. Children of gay couples are often the focus of concern, but studies suggest that parental orientation does not significantly impact their adjustment. Ultimately, the federal government should intervene to legalize same-sex marriage in every state. However, President Bush's stance is grounded in his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. This perspective, while valid, should not dictate national law. Morality, after all, varies greatly among individuals and cultural groups. To impose one group's morality on the entire nation is unethical. Some oppose same-sex marriage due to psychological misconceptions about homosexuality, a notion debunked by the American Psychological Association. Education on these issues is crucial, as it often refutes popular misconceptions and promotes acceptance.",
            "In the course of employment at a hospital pharmacy during the summer months, certain observations regarding illegal drugs have become evident. The mere fact that a substance is deemed unlawful does not inherently negate its potential therapeutic value. Consequently, while I would not advocate for unrestricted public access to such compounds, I do recognize that, in certain contexts, their medicinal properties may be harnessed. For instance, drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which fall under controlled substances, are routinely used in clinical settings due to their beneficial effects. Therefore, to arbitrarily deny similar advantages from other substances, such as marijuana, solely based on societal stigmas appears shortsighted.\n\nMoreover, I contend that a gradual, controlled legalization of marijuana, rather than an abrupt decriminalization, could mitigate potential misuse. By first addressing the cultural taboo surrounding cannabis and promoting responsible use, society could transition more responsibly. The stigma associated with marijuana, often erroneously paralleled to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine, must be dismantled to foster a more pragmatic approach to its potential benefits, particularly in medical applications.",
            "The church has undoubtedly evolved with the times, adapting to the 21st century. The rigidness that once characterized it has significantly diminished. Growing up, I frequently attended church every Sunday, often donning cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. My religious education was a fundamental aspect of my life, and I enjoyed the structured social environment. However, as I've grown older, the church has introduced more contemporary aspects, such as a teenager-friendly mass that's been shortened to thirty minutes and a more casual dress code, particularly during summer. Families often join late, and it's not uncommon to see beach attire. Even morning masses, typically a time for more formal attire, now feature jeans and khakis. The change in the church's atmosphere and dress code is quite noticeable.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Men who become pedophiles are not necessarily deterred by marital status; their attractions are often rooted in genetics. I suspect that these issues are primarily a matter of individual predisposition and not necessarily a result of marital restrictions or lack thereof. If priests are genuinely driven to practice their faith and marry, perhaps they should consider denominations that permit both.\n\nIn my view, the tendency towards pedophilia in some men might be more about inherent genetics than upbringing. Marriage is not a shield against such tendencies, as they often manifest regardless. If the church becomes aware of these issues and attempts to cover them up, that's highly regrettable. However, I doubt that all cases involved knowledge or cover-ups from the church's leadership. My thoughts on the Catholic Church are limited to these observations and don't extend to other aspects of its teachings or practices.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially found the Iraq War's foundation to be tenuous, an opinion amplified by the lingering shock of the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein's regime to Al-Qaeda and the alleged weapons of mass destruction was tenuous and has since been debunked. This misinformation, coupled with the administration's disregard for public interest, has left a sour taste in my mouth. The Iraq War has become a contentious issue, exacerbated by the Bush administration's persistent deceit and constitutional contempt.\n\nColin Powell's recent admissions about his UN presentation underscore this. The administration's willingness to mislead the public, a clear breach of office integrity, has set a precedent of malfeasance. The younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's past, and his interest in securing energy resources, further underscores the war's underhanded origins.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the potential chaos that could ensue from an immediate withdrawal, the current coalition of nations proposed by the UN and USA seems no less fraught. Iraq's political landscape is riddled with disunity and radical factions. The interim government's weakness is evident, with the Prime Minister's control tenuous and key political players like Moqtada al-Sadr gaining significant influence. This political friction, coupled with the sovereignty issue, suggests a precarious situation that may not be easily resolved.\n\nIn polite circles, I refrain from expressing these thoughts, but in an unguarded moment, it's clear that the Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue that has left a lasting impact on the nation and the world.",
            "Oh, alright, let's just dive into this discussion. You want me to share my views on the War in Iraq? Sure thing.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'm not really one to keep up with the finer details of current events. I mean, I know the basics, like the fact that it wasn't exactly a declared war. It felt more like we were just trying to \"even the score\" after 9/11, aiming our sights at Iraq because we suspected they had a hand in those attacks.\n\nI just don't feel strongly about it, you know? I don't really follow the ins and outs. But what I do know is that we've been there for a while, trying to build some sort of democracy. I'm not sure if that's the best use of our resources, though. We've been there so long, and it's causing a lot of unrest, both in Iraq and here at home.\n\nI mean, look at the Vietnam War. It wasn't declared by Congress either, and it's become known as a meaningless conflict. And now, if we leave Iraq, it's going to look like George W. Bush started a pointless war, and that's going to be his legacy. It's not a good look.\n\nBut then again, there are families affected. Sons and daughters over there, fighting in a war that's causing more division and strife. Shouldn't we be helping them? Shouldn't we be trying to make things better for them?\n\nBut at the same time, we're trying to impose our culture and values on a country that has been under a totalitarian system for so long. It's like we're trying to turn them into a second United States, and that could just fuel more hatred towards us. Think about it, Al-Qaeda and all that.\n\nSo, I don't know. It's a tough situation. I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.",
            "Certainly, I must express my reservations about the proposal to legally or statutorily declare it as such. I believe that the decision should rest with the churches, as enshrined in the Constitution's provision for the separation of church and state. It is unequivocally stated, and I maintain that any attempt to exert control over it would be an affront to the established principles. Those advocating for its illegality appear to be favoring one denomination's beliefs over others, as the majority of Catholic and Christian communities are opposed to it, save for a few isolated instances. I contend that the government should not dictate what the churches can or cannot legalize, as this goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in the United States. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, and amending this to restrict it would be counterintuitive and potentially restrictive of individual freedoms. Such an amendment would be unprecedented in its focus on curbing personal liberties rather than government power. Furthermore, I see no compelling reason for the federal government to meddle in this matter, as the president's push seems driven more by his personal beliefs as a Catholic than any broader societal benefits. This is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government, and I fail to see how an amendment, backed only by personal convictions, would have any positive impact. In essence, I believe the churches should decide this issue, not the government or any constituent of it.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nIndeed, the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion was shrouded in ambiguity regarding the government's motives. The notion that the Iraq War was directly linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11th was largely speculative, with the administration manipulating public sentiment to justify military action. The invasion began in 2003, following a period of heightened national outrage over the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn my personal stance, I am staunchly opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in my view, echoes the Vietnam War in its execution and the subsequent aftermath. The loss of numerous American lives is a stark reminder of the gravity of this decision.\n\nThe US government's preparedness for the post-invasion vacuum of power and the resultant chaos was woefully inadequate. The initial plan was to establish a democratic government, similar to the efforts in Vietnam, but the expectation of swift success was naive. The reality was a prolonged, complex struggle with a significant civilian populace resistant to foreign intervention.\n\nThe government's failure to anticipate the prolonged nature of the conflict, coupled with the sheer volume of American casualties, highlights a clear lack of thorough planning. The ongoing training of Iraqi troops and police forces to stabilize the nation underscores the magnitude of the task. The US government's reliance on oil resources and geopolitical interests further clouds the true intentions behind the invasion.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq remains a contentious one, with the 2004 presidential election serving as a focal point for my deliberations. While the sentiment to see the mission through is strong, the fiscal and human cost is also a critical consideration. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the disparity in response to similar threats in other nations, such as North Korea, calls into question the US government's transparency and the underlying reasons for military action.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and divisive issue. The hope for a swift resolution remains, but the reality is a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight.",

            "The digital age has transformed communication, and with it, the implications of what we share online. Once a piece of information is posted on the internet, it becomes a public record, accessible to anyone and everyone. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've had firsthand experience with this very concept. What you post can color how others perceive you, and in extreme cases, it might even lead to serious consequences.\n\nImagine, for instance, if you share content about violent acts or threats. It's crucial to understand that this information can reach authorities, who would then be obligated to investigate due to the potential danger. It's a delicate balance, as not all internet content is indicative of genuine intent. Some individuals might post seemingly innocuous statements that could, in certain contexts, be taken seriously.\n\nIn my school, we've faced situations where overheard comments led to school officials investigating. While it's important to respect privacy, it's also essential to recognize that sharing potentially harmful information circumvents that right. If content is brought to the attention of school officials, they must take it seriously to ensure the safety of the community.\n\nI must stress, though, that I'm not advocating for school officials to monitor private communications like Facebook, Myspace, or even Xanga. Such intrusions are not appropriate. However, when information is shared openly and becomes a matter of public concern, it's a different story. If students are friends with their teachers on these platforms, and a teacher isn't acting deceptively, then any shared information should be taken seriously.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an RA, I wouldn't befriend residents on social media. I prefer to maintain a professional boundary, and I certainly wouldn't want to see personal content that might be inappropriate. However, if concerns arise, I'm duty-bound to address them appropriately, ensuring the safety and well-being of the students under my care.",
            "The conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable: to restore democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, over time, it seems we've lost sight of this objective. The war has become a prolonged display of power, with potential personal agendas from previous political entanglements clouding the initial, noble intent. The conflict's duration far exceeds what was necessary to make a clear statement. We should have achieved our aim within the first few months. Yet, the war drags on, and our reason for continuing is increasingly murky. The war has become an end in itself, with a desire for a decisive victory or exit seemingly more important than the original goal of bringing democracy. It's time to let the local government handle their own affairs. Our economy is suffering, and we have pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure to address. We should be prioritizing our own problems rather than a long-term foreign war. The expenditure on this conflict is not sustainable, and the resources could be better spent on improving our own society.",

            "The Iraq War topic is significant and one I must address; it's a sensitive issue, and I feel compelled to share my perspective, despite its redundancy. Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",
            "Certainly, gender inequality persists in the United States, and it isn't confined to just women. The nature of work can also play a significant role. Women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications, they are passed over for promotions because society expects women to be in subordinate positions.\n\nMoreover, men too face their own set of challenges. For instance, a man choosing to stay at home to be a parent faces societal disapproval. Society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners, and a man defying this norm is often met with disdain.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender bias is evident. Men involved in fashion, especially if they are straight, are sometimes not taken seriously, as they are seen as lacking the \"experience\" of dealing with fashion from a woman's perspective.\n\nIn essence, the prevalence of gender discrimination is influenced by the type of work and the societal expectations surrounding it. Efforts to dismantle these biases are underway but are progressing slowly. Society's mindset is deeply entrenched, and change takes time. It’s crucial to promote the positive aspects of those who are stereotyped without being aggressive. As we see more women in leadership roles and more men at home, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination isn't limited to gender but can also be based on one's upbringing and education. For example, a CEO who grew up on a farm and has less-than-perfect grammar may face discrimination from peers who do not see the value in their intelligence due to their background.\n\nIt's a complex issue with many facets, but progress is indeed being made.",
            "The policy shift entailed a change from criminal to civil penalties. What was once a criminal offense now carries the weight of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. One might receive a citation instead of being booked and arrested. Such a paradigm shift has implications, particularly for job applications and similar contexts, where a drug charge can be a significant hindrance. The future ramifications, especially for marijuana offenses, remain a concern despite the decriminalization. However, the financial burden on municipalities, which includes arrest, booking, legal representation, and court appearances, is considerable. Some communities might hesitate to decriminalize due to these costs and philosophical opposition. In places like Denver, known for its liberal stance, such a change can lead to improved municipal services, such as education and social programs. While marijuana may not be desirable on every street corner, the financial benefits for communities are substantial. However, legalization could lead to widespread availability and use, potentially causing discomfort in society. Conversely, alcohol remains more harmful in terms of motor skills, although both substances have their adverse effects. Personal reactions vary, making it challenging to generalize. Yet, both substances carry risks, and the ability to moderate their use differs from person to person.",
            "I would assert a resounding affirmative in response to your query.\nIndeed, there is a plethora of traditional practices within the Catholic Church that have been maintained over substantial durations.\nRooted in tradition, these rituals provide a sense of continuity and familiarity, which is crucial.\nNevertheless, it is essential to remain adaptable to change, as the world around us is ever-evolving.\nQuite often, it is observed that adherents of the Catholic faith are expected to attend church regularly, with a strict adherence to the doctrines and rituals.\nSometimes, this can lead to feelings of exclusion and intolerance towards those who do not wholeheartedly embrace the Catholicism.\nFor instance, my parents' wedding was not solemnized in the Catholic Church owing to my father's Episcopalian faith, despite the Church's teaching of love and acceptance.\nThis disparity between doctrine and practice can appear contradictory and hypocritical.\nMoreover, while I believe that permitting priests to marry could be advantageous, I do not think it would necessarily mitigate the risk of pedophilic behavior.\nThe problem lies not in marital status, but in the nature of the acts themselves.\nHence, I do not believe that marital status would significantly influence the likelihood of such atrocities.",
            "I must confess, I'm still grappling with this conundrum, and thus, I cannot definitively assert one perspective's superiority over the other. This is perhaps the most contentious issue we face today, especially concerning the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. It seems exceedingly challenging to navigate these waters without causing offense. I suggest considering civil unions, rather than marriage, to avoid entangling the government in religious matters. After all, if two individuals have joined together in a union, shouldn't it be recognized as such, irrespective of their religious beliefs? Moreover, if all states can reach a consensus, they should strive to make it a federal law. However, I strongly oppose the notion of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; it's too significant a cause to warrant altering the constitution. Simply put, it's not substantial enough to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "I hail from a household where Christianity has been a guiding principle, thus I find my stance on homosexuality to be somewhat ambiguous. My circle of friends includes many who identify as LGBTQ+, and while my personal beliefs may not align with their lifestyle, I maintain that they should be legally recognized as equals. To me, the issue of gay marriage is best handled at the state level, rather than by the national government. Each state, after all, has its own political dynamics and cultural landscape, with some leaning more towards liberal policies and others more conservative. Therefore, I believe that the decision to legalize gay marriage should rest with the people of each state, not with the president. I am opposed to a national ban on gay marriage, as it would impose one group's views on the entire nation. Additionally, with the presidency being a temporary position, I think it's unfair for a single leader to set policies that will impact the country for years to come. It's far more reasonable and democratic to leave such matters to the states, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the decision.",
            "I suppose it's fair to say I don't wholly agree. Let's consider the facts. Myspace, for instance, is designed for public use, hence the name. It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place.",
            "I must preface this by acknowledging the profound impact of the events of September 11th on me personally. Initially, I was swayed by the desire for retribution and, in a sense, to wreak havoc as a response to the devastation inflicted upon our soil. However, I've since come to realize that our hasty and emotionally-driven decision to intervene was a grave mistake. The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs. Our presence there has only served to prolong the conflict and create more destruction than it has alleviated. I believe that we are doing more harm than good by remaining."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve. The institution has been grappling with a dwindling number of adherents, and I believe this is largely due to its stringent stances on various social issues. For instance, the Church's position on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception tends to be conservative, which can alienate those who hold opposing views. While these views are deeply ingrained, they may be perceived as outdated. A slight adjustment towards more modern perspectives could potentially mitigate this decline in support. There's a growing segment of the population that's drifting away from the Church due to its viewpoints on these subjects. For example, someone who supports abortion or same-sex marriage may struggle to reconcile these beliefs with the Church's teachings. I am of the opinion that there is no inherent reason why the Church cannot allow female priests or permit priests to marry. While these changes might not have prevented past incidents, they could represent a shift towards a more inclusive and flexible institution. The Church's current policy of requiring celibacy for priests, which it views as a spiritual commitment to God, could, in my opinion, be re-evaluated. Many professionals balance their work with family life and other relationships, so why shouldn't priests be allowed to do the same? However, it's challenging to predict whether such changes would fundamentally alter the Church's behavior in significant ways.",
            "Well, um, I'm not adverse to the idea of same-sex marriage. I mean, I believe that individuals are born with their sexual orientation and I don't think it's something one can necessarily choose. Consequently, I don't believe that gay individuals should be held accountable for their orientation. I find it rather inequitable that a man and a woman can wed, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't really delved deeply into this topic, but I would certainly argue that it's unjust to restrict gay couples from marriage. It's not like they have a choice in their orientation; it's an inherent aspect of their being. I don't believe the federal government should be invested in this matter, as it's not a matter of national security or morals. The government should not interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to who they love. It's simply who they are and they shouldn't be penalized for that. That's my perspective on the matter.",
            "I contend that same-sex marriage ought to be legally recognized. The reasons against it, however, are not compelling. Many argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this perspective is flawed due to the diversity and complexity of relationships. This is akin to viewing heads and tails as distinct entities, even though they are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, numerous civil rights, including property tax benefits and healthcare considerations, are at stake. For instance, the partner of a gay individual may not be permitted to visit in the event of illness, as they are not technically considered family. This seems arbitrary given the commitment such couples share. Scientific research, notably the high rates of relationship satisfaction among homosexual couples, contradicts this notion. Fundamentally, they are requesting a legal document rather than a religious ceremony. Legally recognizing these unions would not breach church-state separation, as it would not involve religious officiation. Segregation and inequality are reminiscent of past policies, and legislation against same-sex marriage is a new form of this. Children of gay couples are often the focus of concern, but studies suggest that parental orientation does not significantly impact their adjustment. Ultimately, the federal government should intervene to legalize same-sex marriage in every state. However, President Bush's stance is grounded in his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. This perspective, while valid, should not dictate national law. Morality, after all, varies greatly among individuals and cultural groups. To impose one group's morality on the entire nation is unethical. Some oppose same-sex marriage due to psychological misconceptions about homosexuality, a notion debunked by the American Psychological Association. Education on these issues is crucial, as it often refutes popular misconceptions and promotes acceptance.",
            "In the course of employment at a hospital pharmacy during the summer months, certain observations regarding illegal drugs have become evident. The mere fact that a substance is deemed unlawful does not inherently negate its potential therapeutic value. Consequently, while I would not advocate for unrestricted public access to such compounds, I do recognize that, in certain contexts, their medicinal properties may be harnessed. For instance, drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which fall under controlled substances, are routinely used in clinical settings due to their beneficial effects. Therefore, to arbitrarily deny similar advantages from other substances, such as marijuana, solely based on societal stigmas appears shortsighted.\n\nMoreover, I contend that a gradual, controlled legalization of marijuana, rather than an abrupt decriminalization, could mitigate potential misuse. By first addressing the cultural taboo surrounding cannabis and promoting responsible use, society could transition more responsibly. The stigma associated with marijuana, often erroneously paralleled to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine, must be dismantled to foster a more pragmatic approach to its potential benefits, particularly in medical applications.",
            "The church has undoubtedly evolved with the times, adapting to the 21st century. The rigidness that once characterized it has significantly diminished. Growing up, I frequently attended church every Sunday, often donning cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. My religious education was a fundamental aspect of my life, and I enjoyed the structured social environment. However, as I've grown older, the church has introduced more contemporary aspects, such as a teenager-friendly mass that's been shortened to thirty minutes and a more casual dress code, particularly during summer. Families often join late, and it's not uncommon to see beach attire. Even morning masses, typically a time for more formal attire, now feature jeans and khakis. The change in the church's atmosphere and dress code is quite noticeable.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Men who become pedophiles are not necessarily deterred by marital status; their attractions are often rooted in genetics. I suspect that these issues are primarily a matter of individual predisposition and not necessarily a result of marital restrictions or lack thereof. If priests are genuinely driven to practice their faith and marry, perhaps they should consider denominations that permit both.\n\nIn my view, the tendency towards pedophilia in some men might be more about inherent genetics than upbringing. Marriage is not a shield against such tendencies, as they often manifest regardless. If the church becomes aware of these issues and attempts to cover them up, that's highly regrettable. However, I doubt that all cases involved knowledge or cover-ups from the church's leadership. My thoughts on the Catholic Church are limited to these observations and don't extend to other aspects of its teachings or practices.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially found the Iraq War's foundation to be tenuous, an opinion amplified by the lingering shock of the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein's regime to Al-Qaeda and the alleged weapons of mass destruction was tenuous and has since been debunked. This misinformation, coupled with the administration's disregard for public interest, has left a sour taste in my mouth. The Iraq War has become a contentious issue, exacerbated by the Bush administration's persistent deceit and constitutional contempt.\n\nColin Powell's recent admissions about his UN presentation underscore this. The administration's willingness to mislead the public, a clear breach of office integrity, has set a precedent of malfeasance. The younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's past, and his interest in securing energy resources, further underscores the war's underhanded origins.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the potential chaos that could ensue from an immediate withdrawal, the current coalition of nations proposed by the UN and USA seems no less fraught. Iraq's political landscape is riddled with disunity and radical factions. The interim government's weakness is evident, with the Prime Minister's control tenuous and key political players like Moqtada al-Sadr gaining significant influence. This political friction, coupled with the sovereignty issue, suggests a precarious situation that may not be easily resolved.\n\nIn polite circles, I refrain from expressing these thoughts, but in an unguarded moment, it's clear that the Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue that has left a lasting impact on the nation and the world.",
            "Oh, alright, let's just dive into this discussion. You want me to share my views on the War in Iraq? Sure thing.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'm not really one to keep up with the finer details of current events. I mean, I know the basics, like the fact that it wasn't exactly a declared war. It felt more like we were just trying to \"even the score\" after 9/11, aiming our sights at Iraq because we suspected they had a hand in those attacks.\n\nI just don't feel strongly about it, you know? I don't really follow the ins and outs. But what I do know is that we've been there for a while, trying to build some sort of democracy. I'm not sure if that's the best use of our resources, though. We've been there so long, and it's causing a lot of unrest, both in Iraq and here at home.\n\nI mean, look at the Vietnam War. It wasn't declared by Congress either, and it's become known as a meaningless conflict. And now, if we leave Iraq, it's going to look like George W. Bush started a pointless war, and that's going to be his legacy. It's not a good look.\n\nBut then again, there are families affected. Sons and daughters over there, fighting in a war that's causing more division and strife. Shouldn't we be helping them? Shouldn't we be trying to make things better for them?\n\nBut at the same time, we're trying to impose our culture and values on a country that has been under a totalitarian system for so long. It's like we're trying to turn them into a second United States, and that could just fuel more hatred towards us. Think about it, Al-Qaeda and all that.\n\nSo, I don't know. It's a tough situation. I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.",
            "Certainly, I must express my reservations about the proposal to legally or statutorily declare it as such. I believe that the decision should rest with the churches, as enshrined in the Constitution's provision for the separation of church and state. It is unequivocally stated, and I maintain that any attempt to exert control over it would be an affront to the established principles. Those advocating for its illegality appear to be favoring one denomination's beliefs over others, as the majority of Catholic and Christian communities are opposed to it, save for a few isolated instances. I contend that the government should not dictate what the churches can or cannot legalize, as this goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in the United States. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, and amending this to restrict it would be counterintuitive and potentially restrictive of individual freedoms. Such an amendment would be unprecedented in its focus on curbing personal liberties rather than government power. Furthermore, I see no compelling reason for the federal government to meddle in this matter, as the president's push seems driven more by his personal beliefs as a Catholic than any broader societal benefits. This is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government, and I fail to see how an amendment, backed only by personal convictions, would have any positive impact. In essence, I believe the churches should decide this issue, not the government or any constituent of it.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nIndeed, the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion was shrouded in ambiguity regarding the government's motives. The notion that the Iraq War was directly linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11th was largely speculative, with the administration manipulating public sentiment to justify military action. The invasion began in 2003, following a period of heightened national outrage over the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn my personal stance, I am staunchly opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in my view, echoes the Vietnam War in its execution and the subsequent aftermath. The loss of numerous American lives is a stark reminder of the gravity of this decision.\n\nThe US government's preparedness for the post-invasion vacuum of power and the resultant chaos was woefully inadequate. The initial plan was to establish a democratic government, similar to the efforts in Vietnam, but the expectation of swift success was naive. The reality was a prolonged, complex struggle with a significant civilian populace resistant to foreign intervention.\n\nThe government's failure to anticipate the prolonged nature of the conflict, coupled with the sheer volume of American casualties, highlights a clear lack of thorough planning. The ongoing training of Iraqi troops and police forces to stabilize the nation underscores the magnitude of the task. The US government's reliance on oil resources and geopolitical interests further clouds the true intentions behind the invasion.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq remains a contentious one, with the 2004 presidential election serving as a focal point for my deliberations. While the sentiment to see the mission through is strong, the fiscal and human cost is also a critical consideration. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the disparity in response to similar threats in other nations, such as North Korea, calls into question the US government's transparency and the underlying reasons for military action.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and divisive issue. The hope for a swift resolution remains, but the reality is a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight.",

            "The digital age has transformed communication, and with it, the implications of what we share online. Once a piece of information is posted on the internet, it becomes a public record, accessible to anyone and everyone. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've had firsthand experience with this very concept. What you post can color how others perceive you, and in extreme cases, it might even lead to serious consequences.\n\nImagine, for instance, if you share content about violent acts or threats. It's crucial to understand that this information can reach authorities, who would then be obligated to investigate due to the potential danger. It's a delicate balance, as not all internet content is indicative of genuine intent. Some individuals might post seemingly innocuous statements that could, in certain contexts, be taken seriously.\n\nIn my school, we've faced situations where overheard comments led to school officials investigating. While it's important to respect privacy, it's also essential to recognize that sharing potentially harmful information circumvents that right. If content is brought to the attention of school officials, they must take it seriously to ensure the safety of the community.\n\nI must stress, though, that I'm not advocating for school officials to monitor private communications like Facebook, Myspace, or even Xanga. Such intrusions are not appropriate. However, when information is shared openly and becomes a matter of public concern, it's a different story. If students are friends with their teachers on these platforms, and a teacher isn't acting deceptively, then any shared information should be taken seriously.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an RA, I wouldn't befriend residents on social media. I prefer to maintain a professional boundary, and I certainly wouldn't want to see personal content that might be inappropriate. However, if concerns arise, I'm duty-bound to address them appropriately, ensuring the safety and well-being of the students under my care.",
            "The conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable: to restore democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, over time, it seems we've lost sight of this objective. The war has become a prolonged display of power, with potential personal agendas from previous political entanglements clouding the initial, noble intent. The conflict's duration far exceeds what was necessary to make a clear statement. We should have achieved our aim within the first few months. Yet, the war drags on, and our reason for continuing is increasingly murky. The war has become an end in itself, with a desire for a decisive victory or exit seemingly more important than the original goal of bringing democracy. It's time to let the local government handle their own affairs. Our economy is suffering, and we have pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure to address. We should be prioritizing our own problems rather than a long-term foreign war. The expenditure on this conflict is not sustainable, and the resources could be better spent on improving our own society.",

            "The Iraq War topic is significant and one I must address; it's a sensitive issue, and I feel compelled to share my perspective, despite its redundancy. Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",
            "Certainly, gender inequality persists in the United States, and it isn't confined to just women. The nature of work can also play a significant role. Women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications, they are passed over for promotions because society expects women to be in subordinate positions.\n\nMoreover, men too face their own set of challenges. For instance, a man choosing to stay at home to be a parent faces societal disapproval. Society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners, and a man defying this norm is often met with disdain.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender bias is evident. Men involved in fashion, especially if they are straight, are sometimes not taken seriously, as they are seen as lacking the \"experience\" of dealing with fashion from a woman's perspective.\n\nIn essence, the prevalence of gender discrimination is influenced by the type of work and the societal expectations surrounding it. Efforts to dismantle these biases are underway but are progressing slowly. Society's mindset is deeply entrenched, and change takes time. It’s crucial to promote the positive aspects of those who are stereotyped without being aggressive. As we see more women in leadership roles and more men at home, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination isn't limited to gender but can also be based on one's upbringing and education. For example, a CEO who grew up on a farm and has less-than-perfect grammar may face discrimination from peers who do not see the value in their intelligence due to their background.\n\nIt's a complex issue with many facets, but progress is indeed being made.",
            "The policy shift entailed a change from criminal to civil penalties. What was once a criminal offense now carries the weight of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. One might receive a citation instead of being booked and arrested. Such a paradigm shift has implications, particularly for job applications and similar contexts, where a drug charge can be a significant hindrance. The future ramifications, especially for marijuana offenses, remain a concern despite the decriminalization. However, the financial burden on municipalities, which includes arrest, booking, legal representation, and court appearances, is considerable. Some communities might hesitate to decriminalize due to these costs and philosophical opposition. In places like Denver, known for its liberal stance, such a change can lead to improved municipal services, such as education and social programs. While marijuana may not be desirable on every street corner, the financial benefits for communities are substantial. However, legalization could lead to widespread availability and use, potentially causing discomfort in society. Conversely, alcohol remains more harmful in terms of motor skills, although both substances have their adverse effects. Personal reactions vary, making it challenging to generalize. Yet, both substances carry risks, and the ability to moderate their use differs from person to person.",
            "I would assert a resounding affirmative in response to your query.\nIndeed, there is a plethora of traditional practices within the Catholic Church that have been maintained over substantial durations.\nRooted in tradition, these rituals provide a sense of continuity and familiarity, which is crucial.\nNevertheless, it is essential to remain adaptable to change, as the world around us is ever-evolving.\nQuite often, it is observed that adherents of the Catholic faith are expected to attend church regularly, with a strict adherence to the doctrines and rituals.\nSometimes, this can lead to feelings of exclusion and intolerance towards those who do not wholeheartedly embrace the Catholicism.\nFor instance, my parents' wedding was not solemnized in the Catholic Church owing to my father's Episcopalian faith, despite the Church's teaching of love and acceptance.\nThis disparity between doctrine and practice can appear contradictory and hypocritical.\nMoreover, while I believe that permitting priests to marry could be advantageous, I do not think it would necessarily mitigate the risk of pedophilic behavior.\nThe problem lies not in marital status, but in the nature of the acts themselves.\nHence, I do not believe that marital status would significantly influence the likelihood of such atrocities.",
            "I must confess, I'm still grappling with this conundrum, and thus, I cannot definitively assert one perspective's superiority over the other. This is perhaps the most contentious issue we face today, especially concerning the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. It seems exceedingly challenging to navigate these waters without causing offense. I suggest considering civil unions, rather than marriage, to avoid entangling the government in religious matters. After all, if two individuals have joined together in a union, shouldn't it be recognized as such, irrespective of their religious beliefs? Moreover, if all states can reach a consensus, they should strive to make it a federal law. However, I strongly oppose the notion of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; it's too significant a cause to warrant altering the constitution. Simply put, it's not substantial enough to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "I hail from a household where Christianity has been a guiding principle, thus I find my stance on homosexuality to be somewhat ambiguous. My circle of friends includes many who identify as LGBTQ+, and while my personal beliefs may not align with their lifestyle, I maintain that they should be legally recognized as equals. To me, the issue of gay marriage is best handled at the state level, rather than by the national government. Each state, after all, has its own political dynamics and cultural landscape, with some leaning more towards liberal policies and others more conservative. Therefore, I believe that the decision to legalize gay marriage should rest with the people of each state, not with the president. I am opposed to a national ban on gay marriage, as it would impose one group's views on the entire nation. Additionally, with the presidency being a temporary position, I think it's unfair for a single leader to set policies that will impact the country for years to come. It's far more reasonable and democratic to leave such matters to the states, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the decision.",
            "I suppose it's fair to say I don't wholly agree. Let's consider the facts. Myspace, for instance, is designed for public use, hence the name. It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place.",
            "I must preface this by acknowledging the profound impact of the events of September 11th on me personally. Initially, I was swayed by the desire for retribution and, in a sense, to wreak havoc as a response to the devastation inflicted upon our soil. However, I've since come to realize that our hasty and emotionally-driven decision to intervene was a grave mistake. The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs. Our presence there has only served to prolong the conflict and create more destruction than it has alleviated. I believe that we are doing more harm than good by remaining."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve. The institution has been grappling with a dwindling number of adherents, and I believe this is largely due to its stringent stances on various social issues. For instance, the Church's position on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception tends to be conservative, which can alienate those who hold opposing views. While these views are deeply ingrained, they may be perceived as outdated. A slight adjustment towards more modern perspectives could potentially mitigate this decline in support. There's a growing segment of the population that's drifting away from the Church due to its viewpoints on these subjects. For example, someone who supports abortion or same-sex marriage may struggle to reconcile these beliefs with the Church's teachings. I am of the opinion that there is no inherent reason why the Church cannot allow female priests or permit priests to marry. While these changes might not have prevented past incidents, they could represent a shift towards a more inclusive and flexible institution. The Church's current policy of requiring celibacy for priests, which it views as a spiritual commitment to God, could, in my opinion, be re-evaluated. Many professionals balance their work with family life and other relationships, so why shouldn't priests be allowed to do the same? However, it's challenging to predict whether such changes would fundamentally alter the Church's behavior in significant ways.",
            "Well, um, I'm not adverse to the idea of same-sex marriage. I mean, I believe that individuals are born with their sexual orientation and I don't think it's something one can necessarily choose. Consequently, I don't believe that gay individuals should be held accountable for their orientation. I find it rather inequitable that a man and a woman can wed, but two people of the same sex cannot. I haven't really delved deeply into this topic, but I would certainly argue that it's unjust to restrict gay couples from marriage. It's not like they have a choice in their orientation; it's an inherent aspect of their being. I don't believe the federal government should be invested in this matter, as it's not a matter of national security or morals. The government should not interfere in people's personal lives, especially when it comes to who they love. It's simply who they are and they shouldn't be penalized for that. That's my perspective on the matter.",
            "I contend that same-sex marriage ought to be legally recognized. The reasons against it, however, are not compelling. Many argue that homosexual couples pose a threat to traditional families, but this perspective is flawed due to the diversity and complexity of relationships. This is akin to viewing heads and tails as distinct entities, even though they are two sides of the same coin. Moreover, numerous civil rights, including property tax benefits and healthcare considerations, are at stake. For instance, the partner of a gay individual may not be permitted to visit in the event of illness, as they are not technically considered family. This seems arbitrary given the commitment such couples share. Scientific research, notably the high rates of relationship satisfaction among homosexual couples, contradicts this notion. Fundamentally, they are requesting a legal document rather than a religious ceremony. Legally recognizing these unions would not breach church-state separation, as it would not involve religious officiation. Segregation and inequality are reminiscent of past policies, and legislation against same-sex marriage is a new form of this. Children of gay couples are often the focus of concern, but studies suggest that parental orientation does not significantly impact their adjustment. Ultimately, the federal government should intervene to legalize same-sex marriage in every state. However, President Bush's stance is grounded in his religious beliefs, similar to his views on abortion and stem cell research. This perspective, while valid, should not dictate national law. Morality, after all, varies greatly among individuals and cultural groups. To impose one group's morality on the entire nation is unethical. Some oppose same-sex marriage due to psychological misconceptions about homosexuality, a notion debunked by the American Psychological Association. Education on these issues is crucial, as it often refutes popular misconceptions and promotes acceptance.",
            "In the course of employment at a hospital pharmacy during the summer months, certain observations regarding illegal drugs have become evident. The mere fact that a substance is deemed unlawful does not inherently negate its potential therapeutic value. Consequently, while I would not advocate for unrestricted public access to such compounds, I do recognize that, in certain contexts, their medicinal properties may be harnessed. For instance, drugs like oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which fall under controlled substances, are routinely used in clinical settings due to their beneficial effects. Therefore, to arbitrarily deny similar advantages from other substances, such as marijuana, solely based on societal stigmas appears shortsighted.\n\nMoreover, I contend that a gradual, controlled legalization of marijuana, rather than an abrupt decriminalization, could mitigate potential misuse. By first addressing the cultural taboo surrounding cannabis and promoting responsible use, society could transition more responsibly. The stigma associated with marijuana, often erroneously paralleled to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine, must be dismantled to foster a more pragmatic approach to its potential benefits, particularly in medical applications.",
            "The church has undoubtedly evolved with the times, adapting to the 21st century. The rigidness that once characterized it has significantly diminished. Growing up, I frequently attended church every Sunday, often donning cute dresses, matching shoes, and a purse. My religious education was a fundamental aspect of my life, and I enjoyed the structured social environment. However, as I've grown older, the church has introduced more contemporary aspects, such as a teenager-friendly mass that's been shortened to thirty minutes and a more casual dress code, particularly during summer. Families often join late, and it's not uncommon to see beach attire. Even morning masses, typically a time for more formal attire, now feature jeans and khakis. The change in the church's atmosphere and dress code is quite noticeable.\n\nRegarding the allegations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe these incidents could not have been entirely prevented by changes such as allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. Men who become pedophiles are not necessarily deterred by marital status; their attractions are often rooted in genetics. I suspect that these issues are primarily a matter of individual predisposition and not necessarily a result of marital restrictions or lack thereof. If priests are genuinely driven to practice their faith and marry, perhaps they should consider denominations that permit both.\n\nIn my view, the tendency towards pedophilia in some men might be more about inherent genetics than upbringing. Marriage is not a shield against such tendencies, as they often manifest regardless. If the church becomes aware of these issues and attempts to cover them up, that's highly regrettable. However, I doubt that all cases involved knowledge or cover-ups from the church's leadership. My thoughts on the Catholic Church are limited to these observations and don't extend to other aspects of its teachings or practices.",
            "Upon reflection, I initially found the Iraq War's foundation to be tenuous, an opinion amplified by the lingering shock of the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein's regime to Al-Qaeda and the alleged weapons of mass destruction was tenuous and has since been debunked. This misinformation, coupled with the administration's disregard for public interest, has left a sour taste in my mouth. The Iraq War has become a contentious issue, exacerbated by the Bush administration's persistent deceit and constitutional contempt.\n\nColin Powell's recent admissions about his UN presentation underscore this. The administration's willingness to mislead the public, a clear breach of office integrity, has set a precedent of malfeasance. The younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, fueled by his father's past, and his interest in securing energy resources, further underscores the war's underhanded origins.\n\nWhile I acknowledge the potential chaos that could ensue from an immediate withdrawal, the current coalition of nations proposed by the UN and USA seems no less fraught. Iraq's political landscape is riddled with disunity and radical factions. The interim government's weakness is evident, with the Prime Minister's control tenuous and key political players like Moqtada al-Sadr gaining significant influence. This political friction, coupled with the sovereignty issue, suggests a precarious situation that may not be easily resolved.\n\nIn polite circles, I refrain from expressing these thoughts, but in an unguarded moment, it's clear that the Iraq War has been a complex and contentious issue that has left a lasting impact on the nation and the world.",
            "Oh, alright, let's just dive into this discussion. You want me to share my views on the War in Iraq? Sure thing.\n\nWell, to be honest, I'm not really one to keep up with the finer details of current events. I mean, I know the basics, like the fact that it wasn't exactly a declared war. It felt more like we were just trying to \"even the score\" after 9/11, aiming our sights at Iraq because we suspected they had a hand in those attacks.\n\nI just don't feel strongly about it, you know? I don't really follow the ins and outs. But what I do know is that we've been there for a while, trying to build some sort of democracy. I'm not sure if that's the best use of our resources, though. We've been there so long, and it's causing a lot of unrest, both in Iraq and here at home.\n\nI mean, look at the Vietnam War. It wasn't declared by Congress either, and it's become known as a meaningless conflict. And now, if we leave Iraq, it's going to look like George W. Bush started a pointless war, and that's going to be his legacy. It's not a good look.\n\nBut then again, there are families affected. Sons and daughters over there, fighting in a war that's causing more division and strife. Shouldn't we be helping them? Shouldn't we be trying to make things better for them?\n\nBut at the same time, we're trying to impose our culture and values on a country that has been under a totalitarian system for so long. It's like we're trying to turn them into a second United States, and that could just fuel more hatred towards us. Think about it, Al-Qaeda and all that.\n\nSo, I don't know. It's a tough situation. I guess we'll just have to see how it plays out.",
            "Certainly, I must express my reservations about the proposal to legally or statutorily declare it as such. I believe that the decision should rest with the churches, as enshrined in the Constitution's provision for the separation of church and state. It is unequivocally stated, and I maintain that any attempt to exert control over it would be an affront to the established principles. Those advocating for its illegality appear to be favoring one denomination's beliefs over others, as the majority of Catholic and Christian communities are opposed to it, save for a few isolated instances. I contend that the government should not dictate what the churches can or cannot legalize, as this goes against the spirit of religious tolerance in the United States. The separation of church and state has been a cornerstone of our Constitution, and amending this to restrict it would be counterintuitive and potentially restrictive of individual freedoms. Such an amendment would be unprecedented in its focus on curbing personal liberties rather than government power. Furthermore, I see no compelling reason for the federal government to meddle in this matter, as the president's push seems driven more by his personal beliefs as a Catholic than any broader societal benefits. This is a matter for the churches to decide, not the government, and I fail to see how an amendment, backed only by personal convictions, would have any positive impact. In essence, I believe the churches should decide this issue, not the government or any constituent of it.",
            "The conflict in Iraq\nIndeed, the situation in Iraq prior to the invasion was shrouded in ambiguity regarding the government's motives. The notion that the Iraq War was directly linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11th was largely speculative, with the administration manipulating public sentiment to justify military action. The invasion began in 2003, following a period of heightened national outrage over the 9/11 attacks.\n\nIn my personal stance, I am staunchly opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The Iraq War, in my view, echoes the Vietnam War in its execution and the subsequent aftermath. The loss of numerous American lives is a stark reminder of the gravity of this decision.\n\nThe US government's preparedness for the post-invasion vacuum of power and the resultant chaos was woefully inadequate. The initial plan was to establish a democratic government, similar to the efforts in Vietnam, but the expectation of swift success was naive. The reality was a prolonged, complex struggle with a significant civilian populace resistant to foreign intervention.\n\nThe government's failure to anticipate the prolonged nature of the conflict, coupled with the sheer volume of American casualties, highlights a clear lack of thorough planning. The ongoing training of Iraqi troops and police forces to stabilize the nation underscores the magnitude of the task. The US government's reliance on oil resources and geopolitical interests further clouds the true intentions behind the invasion.\n\nThe decision to invade Iraq remains a contentious one, with the 2004 presidential election serving as a focal point for my deliberations. While the sentiment to see the mission through is strong, the fiscal and human cost is also a critical consideration. The absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the disparity in response to similar threats in other nations, such as North Korea, calls into question the US government's transparency and the underlying reasons for military action.\n\nIn conclusion, the Iraq War is a complex and divisive issue. The hope for a swift resolution remains, but the reality is a protracted conflict with no clear end in sight.",

            "The digital age has transformed communication, and with it, the implications of what we share online. Once a piece of information is posted on the internet, it becomes a public record, accessible to anyone and everyone. As a Resident Assistant (RA), I've had firsthand experience with this very concept. What you post can color how others perceive you, and in extreme cases, it might even lead to serious consequences.\n\nImagine, for instance, if you share content about violent acts or threats. It's crucial to understand that this information can reach authorities, who would then be obligated to investigate due to the potential danger. It's a delicate balance, as not all internet content is indicative of genuine intent. Some individuals might post seemingly innocuous statements that could, in certain contexts, be taken seriously.\n\nIn my school, we've faced situations where overheard comments led to school officials investigating. While it's important to respect privacy, it's also essential to recognize that sharing potentially harmful information circumvents that right. If content is brought to the attention of school officials, they must take it seriously to ensure the safety of the community.\n\nI must stress, though, that I'm not advocating for school officials to monitor private communications like Facebook, Myspace, or even Xanga. Such intrusions are not appropriate. However, when information is shared openly and becomes a matter of public concern, it's a different story. If students are friends with their teachers on these platforms, and a teacher isn't acting deceptively, then any shared information should be taken seriously.\n\nIn my personal capacity as an RA, I wouldn't befriend residents on social media. I prefer to maintain a professional boundary, and I certainly wouldn't want to see personal content that might be inappropriate. However, if concerns arise, I'm duty-bound to address them appropriately, ensuring the safety and well-being of the students under my care.",
            "The conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the aim was commendable: to restore democracy in a nation lacking a fair political system. However, over time, it seems we've lost sight of this objective. The war has become a prolonged display of power, with potential personal agendas from previous political entanglements clouding the initial, noble intent. The conflict's duration far exceeds what was necessary to make a clear statement. We should have achieved our aim within the first few months. Yet, the war drags on, and our reason for continuing is increasingly murky. The war has become an end in itself, with a desire for a decisive victory or exit seemingly more important than the original goal of bringing democracy. It's time to let the local government handle their own affairs. Our economy is suffering, and we have pressing domestic issues like poverty and infrastructure to address. We should be prioritizing our own problems rather than a long-term foreign war. The expenditure on this conflict is not sustainable, and the resources could be better spent on improving our own society.",

            "The Iraq War topic is significant and one I must address; it's a sensitive issue, and I feel compelled to share my perspective, despite its redundancy. Initially, I was opposed, but time has rendered it less pressing. The majority's consensus, including global and Iraqi polls, indicates the war was a poor decision. With 75-80% of the world's population and a substantial portion of U.S. troops agreeing, it's evident the conflict was a misguided venture. The Middle East's culture and political landscape render the region's governance challenging for outsiders, particularly the U.S. administration. While Saddam Hussein was oppressive, the consequences of invasion have far outweighed any perceived benefits. The situation has been chaotic since our entry, and withdrawal poses its challenges. I'm unconvinced by the administration's rationale for prolonged involvement. Gradual withdrawal over a year or more might be feasible, but immediate evacuation seems more prudent. Iraqi citizens, those we're attempting to aid, overwhelmingly desire our departure. Their insights on the situation should weigh heavily in our decision-making process. Ultimately, we should respect their wishes, even if it means conceding that our involvement has not been beneficial. We'll likely never be seen as benevolent in the Middle East, but retreating now might improve our standing marginally.",
            "Certainly, gender inequality persists in the United States, and it isn't confined to just women. The nature of work can also play a significant role. Women often face the \"glass ceiling,\" where despite their qualifications, they are passed over for promotions because society expects women to be in subordinate positions.\n\nMoreover, men too face their own set of challenges. For instance, a man choosing to stay at home to be a parent faces societal disapproval. Society often expects men to be the primary breadwinners, and a man defying this norm is often met with disdain.\n\nThe fashion industry is another area where gender bias is evident. Men involved in fashion, especially if they are straight, are sometimes not taken seriously, as they are seen as lacking the \"experience\" of dealing with fashion from a woman's perspective.\n\nIn essence, the prevalence of gender discrimination is influenced by the type of work and the societal expectations surrounding it. Efforts to dismantle these biases are underway but are progressing slowly. Society's mindset is deeply entrenched, and change takes time. It’s crucial to promote the positive aspects of those who are stereotyped without being aggressive. As we see more women in leadership roles and more men at home, societal attitudes are gradually shifting.\n\nFurthermore, discrimination isn't limited to gender but can also be based on one's upbringing and education. For example, a CEO who grew up on a farm and has less-than-perfect grammar may face discrimination from peers who do not see the value in their intelligence due to their background.\n\nIt's a complex issue with many facets, but progress is indeed being made.",
            "The policy shift entailed a change from criminal to civil penalties. What was once a criminal offense now carries the weight of a minor infraction, similar to a traffic ticket. One might receive a citation instead of being booked and arrested. Such a paradigm shift has implications, particularly for job applications and similar contexts, where a drug charge can be a significant hindrance. The future ramifications, especially for marijuana offenses, remain a concern despite the decriminalization. However, the financial burden on municipalities, which includes arrest, booking, legal representation, and court appearances, is considerable. Some communities might hesitate to decriminalize due to these costs and philosophical opposition. In places like Denver, known for its liberal stance, such a change can lead to improved municipal services, such as education and social programs. While marijuana may not be desirable on every street corner, the financial benefits for communities are substantial. However, legalization could lead to widespread availability and use, potentially causing discomfort in society. Conversely, alcohol remains more harmful in terms of motor skills, although both substances have their adverse effects. Personal reactions vary, making it challenging to generalize. Yet, both substances carry risks, and the ability to moderate their use differs from person to person.",
            "I would assert a resounding affirmative in response to your query.\nIndeed, there is a plethora of traditional practices within the Catholic Church that have been maintained over substantial durations.\nRooted in tradition, these rituals provide a sense of continuity and familiarity, which is crucial.\nNevertheless, it is essential to remain adaptable to change, as the world around us is ever-evolving.\nQuite often, it is observed that adherents of the Catholic faith are expected to attend church regularly, with a strict adherence to the doctrines and rituals.\nSometimes, this can lead to feelings of exclusion and intolerance towards those who do not wholeheartedly embrace the Catholicism.\nFor instance, my parents' wedding was not solemnized in the Catholic Church owing to my father's Episcopalian faith, despite the Church's teaching of love and acceptance.\nThis disparity between doctrine and practice can appear contradictory and hypocritical.\nMoreover, while I believe that permitting priests to marry could be advantageous, I do not think it would necessarily mitigate the risk of pedophilic behavior.\nThe problem lies not in marital status, but in the nature of the acts themselves.\nHence, I do not believe that marital status would significantly influence the likelihood of such atrocities.",
            "I must confess, I'm still grappling with this conundrum, and thus, I cannot definitively assert one perspective's superiority over the other. This is perhaps the most contentious issue we face today, especially concerning the delicate balance between the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage. It seems exceedingly challenging to navigate these waters without causing offense. I suggest considering civil unions, rather than marriage, to avoid entangling the government in religious matters. After all, if two individuals have joined together in a union, shouldn't it be recognized as such, irrespective of their religious beliefs? Moreover, if all states can reach a consensus, they should strive to make it a federal law. However, I strongly oppose the notion of a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage; it's too significant a cause to warrant altering the constitution. Simply put, it's not substantial enough to warrant such a drastic measure.",
            "I hail from a household where Christianity has been a guiding principle, thus I find my stance on homosexuality to be somewhat ambiguous. My circle of friends includes many who identify as LGBTQ+, and while my personal beliefs may not align with their lifestyle, I maintain that they should be legally recognized as equals. To me, the issue of gay marriage is best handled at the state level, rather than by the national government. Each state, after all, has its own political dynamics and cultural landscape, with some leaning more towards liberal policies and others more conservative. Therefore, I believe that the decision to legalize gay marriage should rest with the people of each state, not with the president. I am opposed to a national ban on gay marriage, as it would impose one group's views on the entire nation. Additionally, with the presidency being a temporary position, I think it's unfair for a single leader to set policies that will impact the country for years to come. It's far more reasonable and democratic to leave such matters to the states, as they are the ones who will be most affected by the decision.",
            "I suppose it's fair to say I don't wholly agree. Let's consider the facts. Myspace, for instance, is designed for public use, hence the name. It's essentially a bulletin board for public consumption. It's evident that anything posted there is meant to be viewed by others. Now, if a student is posting something on the internet, they're aware that it's accessible to anyone, be it school officials or not. I believe that school officials have the right to view such content, especially if it's from their jurisdiction. It's like a school's responsibility to ensure its students' safety. If they're not doing this under the school's name, they could still stumble upon it through personal means. However, I must acknowledge that using it to catch students in misbehavior seems like an invasion of privacy. Nevertheless, if it's to save lives or make the school a safer place, I don't see it as an invasion. It's like if they're using the internet to ensure students are not engaging in harmful activities like drinking or smoking, which could potentially harm others. It's all about balance. I'm not trying to imply that it's not an invasion, but if it's to protect students, then it's justifiable. I mean, it's a public platform and students should know they're posting in a public domain. If they're not expecting trouble, they're being naive. I don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students, but if it's for the school's safety, I can understand it. I've discussed this with a teacher, and they mentioned the importance of ensuring safety, especially after incidents like Columbine. They had to conduct drills and lock downs to prepare for such events. It's all about making the school a safer place.",
            "I must preface this by acknowledging the profound impact of the events of September 11th on me personally. Initially, I was swayed by the desire for retribution and, in a sense, to wreak havoc as a response to the devastation inflicted upon our soil. However, I've since come to realize that our hasty and emotionally-driven decision to intervene was a grave mistake. The long-term consequences and the lack of a coherent plan were significantly overlooked. We entered the conflict ill-prepared, and our objectives were not well-defined. Our involvement in the region has not only failed to achieve its intended goals but has also created more instability than it resolved. I question whether we were acting as peacemakers or merely as agents of chaos. The people in the region, it seems, are more adept at infighting than they are at being united under a common cause. Their fighting with each other has been more persistent than any threat they posed to us. I believe we were driven more by a desire for revenge than by a genuine desire to better the lives of the people there. We were, in essence, more concerned with our own emotional needs than with the practical realities of the situation. I also suspect that our leaders were more inclined to act out of public pressure and political expediency rather than a carefully considered strategy. We declared war on Iraq without a clear understanding of what we intended to achieve, and our actions were not guided by a unified vision. It seems to me that our presence in the region has been more detrimental than beneficial. The instability has persisted, and our continued involvement is not leading to any meaningful progress. We cannot effectively impose our values and way of life on a society that is so fundamentally different from our own. The people there are not looking to improve their country; they are looking to expel us. I think it would be wiser for us to withdraw and let the people of that region sort out their own affairs. Our presence there has only served to prolong the conflict and create more destruction than it has alleviated. I believe that we are doing more harm than good by remaining."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To my view, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in a few key areas. It has been publicly discussed that the Church is experiencing a decline in membership, and I believe this could be due to its sometimes rigid stance on contemporary societal issues. Concerning matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, the Church holds steadfast views, which, while understandable, can come across as antiquated. If the Church were to embrace more current perspectives, I believe they might find their numbers growing again. Many people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to its views on these subjects, as they no longer align with their personal beliefs. For instance, those who support abortion and same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in an environment where these practices are deemed wrong. The Church's position on these issues is deeply rooted in its history and tradition. However, I don't see any inherent reason why the Church couldn't allow female priests or married priests. While these changes might not have prevented past controversies, they could potentially foster a more inclusive and accepting environment. In my estimation, the Church's dedication to its mission does not preclude it from also nurturing its flock with modern sensibilities.",
            "Certainly, I must preface by stating that I hold no qualms against same-sex marriage. Let us contemplate this matter. Is one's sexual orientation a conscious decision? I believe not. Being born with a particular inclination is hardly a choice one makes. Thus, it seems unjust to hold individuals accountable for their inherent nature. The assertion that only heterosexual unions are permissible while same-sex relationships are not, is, in my opinion, misguided. I have not deeply explored this topic, yet it is evident that the federal government's involvement is unwarranted. It is not a matter of security or moral concern, but rather a personal choice that should be left to the individuals in question.\n\nThe notion that one's sexual orientation is a choice is akin to suggesting that straight people choose to be straight. It is not a decision made, but a state of being. Therefore, it is incorrect to place responsibility on an individual for their sexuality. The federal government should not intervene in what is fundamentally a personal matter. It is not their place to impose their views or to dictate how individuals live their lives. This is not about moral judgment but about respecting the diversity of human nature. The law should not penalize those who are simply being true to themselves.\n\nIn essence, the federal government's involvement is misplaced. It is not a legal or moral responsibility of the state to dictate who can marry whom. It is a matter of personal choice and personal identity, and it is not something that the federal government should be involved in. To do so would be to overstep boundaries and to infringe upon individual rights.",
            "I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage, primarily because the current legal framework fails to account for the depth and complexity of these relationships. Many believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of these unions. The love and commitment between two consenting adults, regardless of their sexual orientation, are fundamentally similar to those shared between heterosexual couples.\n\nFor instance, marriage entitles couples to certain rights and benefits, such as tax breaks and healthcare coverage. When a same-sex couple is denied these rights, it leads to a form of institutionalized discrimination. The argument that marriage is a religious institution is flawed, as marriage is also a civil and legal one, separate from religious doctrine. It is hypocritical to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights while allowing them to form civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of same-sex couples on society, including adoption and community integration, are not supported by empirical evidence. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The federal government should play a pivotal role in ensuring that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have equal rights and protections.\n\nLastly, the opposition to same-sex marriage often hinges on misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked many of these myths, emphasizing that being gay is not a result of psychological trauma or defect. To make informed decisions, we should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or religious beliefs. The government should not dictate morality based on the principles of a particular religious group while ignoring the diverse moral and cultural perspectives of the broader society.",
            "To begin with, I am employed at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It goes without saying that the legality of a substance does not automatically negate its potential benefits, yet I strongly advocate against making it widely accessible to the public. However, for medicinal applications, I am a firm believer in its utility, despite its legal status. The mere fact that a substance is illegal does not make it beneficial. In the realm of pharmacology, we encounter numerous controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which are invaluable in patient care. Denying their benefits based solely on the stigma surrounding marijuana is shortsighted. The key is to embrace the medicinal properties of such substances while maintaining strict regulations to prevent abuse. Unlike alcohol, where overconsumption can lead to detrimental outcomes, marijuana's potential harm is less severe when compared to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. Therefore, gradually normalizing marijuana, starting with its medicinal use and removing the taboo associated with it, could lead to more responsible usage.",
            "The institution of the church has undergone significant modifications to align with the modern era. Its regulations are no longer as stringent as in the past. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with visits to church, and we would all don our finest, including myself. My attire consisted of cute little dresses, matching footwear, and a purse to complement the ensemble. However, my experience has evolved over the years. Now, the church caters to a more contemporary audience, with services tailored to suit the needs of teenagers, lasting a concise thirty minutes. Casual attire has become the norm, especially during summer weekends, where beach attire is not uncommon. Families often arrive late, adding a sense of informality to the proceedings. Even the traditionally formal morning masses have seen a shift towards more relaxed dress codes, with jeans and khakis becoming acceptable. While I acknowledge that this change has been the most noticeable, other aspects of the church remain shrouded in mystery to me. I am unfamiliar with its politics and internal workings.",
            "Initially, I found the original premise acceptable, but I believe the collective shock of the September 11th attacks lingered, and thus, the Iraq War was viewed through a different lens. Early on, the Bush administration linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim later proven false.\n\nThis misrepresentation grates on me, and the Iraq War continues to stir my ire. It seems the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public and has yet to take responsibility for this deception. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, has since expressed skepticism regarding the evidence.\n\nI view this as a dereliction of duty, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially post-September 11th. There's evidence suggesting the younger Bush sought to avenge his father's administration and expand our energy supply, which I find underhanded.\n\nHowever, I believe it's high time we reconsider our involvement. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths, the proposed alternative—a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also presents long-term challenges. The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and the political process faces significant friction.",
            "Let me start by saying that my perspective on the Iraq War is complex and multifaceted. Initially, I was not particularly invested in its progress, given that it was not a declared war in the traditional sense, but rather a response to recent events. My understanding is that it was more of a mission to hold Iraq accountable for suspected involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as to establish a stable, democratic government and ensure access to resources like oil.\n\nHowever, as time has passed, I've grown more critical of our continued presence there. The efforts to establish democracy have been slow and challenging, and I believe that our ongoing involvement is more about maintaining a presence in the region and securing resources than about genuinely helping Iraqis build a better future. I feel that our actions have created a sense of resentment among the local population, and our attempts to impose our values and systems have not necessarily been beneficial.\n\nMoreover, I question the wisdom of continuing a military presence in a region that is deeply divided by cultural, religious, and political beliefs. The situation in Iraq is far from stable and peaceful, and I worry that our continued involvement will only exacerbate the existing conflicts. I believe that it's crucial to reassess our strategy and consider a more nuanced approach that respects local cultures and values while still pursuing our broader geopolitical interests.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the Iraq War are still evolving. I am not convinced that our current approach is the best way to achieve our goals, and I believe that a more diplomatic and culturally sensitive strategy might yield better results in the long run. However, I also acknowledge the challenges involved in withdrawing from a complex and volatile situation.",
            "I must confess, I am not entirely convinced that this matter should be legally or statutorily sanctioned. The Constitution, in its wisdom, established a clear line between the state and religious institutions. I firmly believe it is the prerogative of denominations to regulate such issues.\n\nThe majority of Catholics and Christians, I am informed, are opposed to this. While it may be popular in some regions, such as Boston, the broader consensus among faith communities is against it. It seems to me that this is a matter best left to the discretion of religious bodies rather than the government. The principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American religious tolerance, and any amendment attempting to infringe upon it would be an affront to our founding principles.\n\nFurthermore, I do not see a compelling reason for the government to intervene in this matter. The proposed amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than any tangible benefit to society. I believe that leaving this matter to the individual consciences and the collective judgment of religious institutions would be a more fitting and respectful approach.",
            "The Iraq War\nIn hindsight, I question the American government's candor in communicating the true motivations behind our invasion of Iraq. The government suggested a connection between the 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict, yet this link was tenuous, if not non-existent. They exploited the collective outrage following 9/11 to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003. Personally, I was strongly opposed to the war, especially given the preemptive strike nature. The Iraq War, much like the Vietnam War, was a complex and protracted conflict. The U.S. government removed Iraq's government and attempted to impose a democratic regime, but they did not seem adequately prepared for the aftermath. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were not anticipated, and the U.S. struggled to maintain control and稍微 train local forces.\n\nThe war's similarity to Vietnam is striking. Both conflicts involved trying to install a democratic government in an environment filled with insurgents. The assumption that the process would be swift and successful was naïve. The U.S. underestimated the resilience and complexity of the task at hand, leading to a long and protracted conflict. The U.S. government's decision to engage was problematic, and their failure to plan comprehensive post-invasion strategies was a significant oversight.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to see the Iraq War to its conclusion. However, the high cost in American lives and the potential failure of the mission pose a dilemma. How far should we go to establish a democratic Iraq? The question of whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to see the war through remains unanswered. Additionally, the initial justification for the invasion, the search for weapons of mass destruction, was not borne out. While North Korea, known to possess such weapons, was left untouched, Iraq was invaded. The oil factor cannot be ignored, suggesting a strategic interest beyond democratic altruism.\n\nThe Iraq War is a controversial and complex issue, with no clear resolution in sight. While I hope for peace and stability, I remain skeptical that it will be achieved soon. The U.S. government's handling of the conflict and its motivations have been called into question, and the long-term consequences are still being felt.",
            "I have consistently supported the idea of same-sex marriage. It has always been a matter of personal preference, and I believe that recent scientific evidence points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, which is beyond individual control. I find it inhumane to deny rights based on something that is not controllable. In my neighborhood, we have a few openly gay couples who function as any other family would, and yet, they are not allowed to marry due to societal constraints. I believe it is unfair that our government, especially under Bush's interpretation of marriage, would interfere with personal choices that do not harm others. I've read extensively on the topic and understand that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors rather than upbringing. Marriage, in essence, is a private matter that should not be influenced by government intervention. It should be a personal decision made by individuals, not a public spectacle.",
            "It seems as though you've inadvertently ventured into uncharted waters by posting on the internet. The digital realm is, after all, an open forum. There's no escaping the fact that anything you share online becomes public, and your online persona can shape perceptions about you. For instance, an R.A. position required me to address such issues firsthand. When you share information online, it can influence people's views, and if it's about potentially dangerous topics, it can incite concern. The internet is universally accessible, and if someone at school receives a concerning post, they must act, as neglecting it could lead to unfortunate outcomes. However, discerning what's genuine and what's a prank can be challenging. For instance, a sociology experiment gone awry could seem serious until further context is provided. Thus, if you don't wish for something to be seen or misunderstood, refrain from posting it. It's essential to remember that what you share is your responsibility, and while schools and educators should respect privacy, they must also act when safety is at risk. For example, if a student's post hints at potential harm, it's the school's duty to investigate, even if it involves social media. It's crucial to maintain a healthy boundary regarding online monitoring, such as avoiding friend requests and private messages. However, if a concern is brought to their attention, schools have a responsibility to act, as privacy expectations are already altered when information is shared publicly. After all, it's not our place to police every detail of our residents' lives if it's irrelevant to our tasks.",
            "The conflict has stretched on far too long, I believe. Initially, the aim was commendable, to restore democratic governance in a nation lacking it. However, I suspect that the original intent has been lost over time. It seems we've deviated from our goal, now acting more as a global power display than a genuine effort to democratize. This war may have had personal undertones, given George W. Bush's father's history with Saddam Hussein. If the initial objective was to bring democracy to a repressed people, that could be justified. But with the passage of time, our reasons have become distorted and misguided, mirroring a desire to maintain a prolonged conflict. It's time to end this drawn-out war and redirect our resources to our own pressing issues such as poverty and infrastructure. We're squandering billions on a war that has lost its purpose, while our own citizens face challenges that need immediate attention. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on rebuilding our own country.",
            "Could I inquire about the reasoning behind the prevention?\n\nAh, I believe it was due to someone's online discovery.\n\nOf course, I see\nNo, I don't believe it constitutes a breach of privacy.\n\nOn platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. While you may need to be friends with users to view their profiles, you've essentially granted them permission. Thus, sharing information on the internet implies consent to its visibility.\n\nHowever, it's a challenging situation. While it's impractical for someone to monitor all students' profiles, targeted surveillance could seem discriminatory. Yet, it depends on the context. If the profile was flagged for potential threat or if someone was merely browsing and stumbled upon something concerning, it's understandable.\n\nI myself don't have a Myspace account, but I do use Facebook. I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are individuals who can access personal details about me. I've witnessed a TV program about a man who easily obtained a girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. While I would never meet someone under such circumstances, I've had classmates contact me via instant messenger, knowing my identity despite my limited sharing. They could gather information about my interests, appearance, schedule, and even my friends' details.\n\nI try to limit my posts, but I use it to communicate with friends, so I balance privacy with connectivity. I only accept requests from known individuals, but the uncertainty of unknown viewers remains.\n\nMy roommate shared her high school's experience where students were prohibited from using Myspace. I found this unusual; I'm uncertain of the school's authority to regulate students' online activities.\n\nThis is the only other thought that comes to mind.",

            "I can certainly assert that gender discrimination remains a persistent issue in the United States.\nWhile not exclusively faced by women, the challenges are indeed amplified for them across various sectors of employment.\nThe glass ceiling, a metaphor for the barriers that prevent women from reaching top-level positions, is still a reality.\nSocietal norms and historical prejudices often dictate that men are discouraged from working under women, regardless of qualifications.\nConversely, women may be overlooked for promotions or upper-level positions, as they are not seen as the norm in leadership roles.\nIn industries such as fashion, men can face skepticism about their knowledge of women's styles and preferences, due to societal stereotypes about men in the industry.\nSimilarly, men who choose to stay at home to raise children may face disapproval, as societal expectations often dictate that men should be the primary breadwinners.\nProgress is undeniable, with more women reaching higher positions and greater acceptance, but change remains slow and incremental.\nPromoting the qualities and successes of individuals who defy stereotypes can aid in shifting societal perceptions, rather than forcefully pushing against ingrained beliefs.\nWhile there is still much to be done, current efforts are heading in the right direction, and further advancement will require patience and persistent effort.\nAdditionally, discrimination can occur between individuals based on their background or region, as some may harbor biases against those from less privileged or rural upbringings, regardless of their intelligence or competence.",
            "The situation seems to be that instead of fully legalizing it, they've opted to decriminalize it. This shift downgrades the infraction from a criminal offense to a minor one, akin to receiving a parking ticket rather than facing imprisonment. Should one be caught and cited, the repercussions, like those resulting from a drug charge, become less severe for job interviews and similar contexts. However, it's important to note that the future ramifications of such charges don't entirely vanish with decriminalization.\n\nMoreover, the cost of arresting, housing, and processing individuals is considerable. Municipalities facing financial strain may not be eager to bear these expenses, even if decriminalization could alleviate financial pressure. In a city like Denver, where the populace tends to lean towards more lenient views, the municipality benefits from reduced costs which can then be reallocated to public education, social programs for the elderly, or food programs for the homeless.\n\nWhile marijuana isn't something that should be widely available, the financial implications are significant. It's not just a matter of legalization affecting everyone equally. Some may continue to view it as taboo, making it less socially acceptable to have it openly available. On the other hand, the effects of substances like alcohol and marijuana can vary greatly from person to person. The impact on motor skills and lifestyle can differ based on individual reactions. Consequently, it's challenging to generalize the effects of such substances, but they certainly have their adverse impacts.",
            "I'd agree that\nA significant portion of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nFor instance, they've maintained these rituals over extended periods\nIt's commendable to anchor oneself in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to embrace adaptability\nMany Catholics believe in weekly church attendance\nWith a stringent adherence to ritualistic norms\nSometimes, this can feel exclusive and unyielding\nIntroducing non-conforming individuals can challenge their doctrines\nFor example, my parents' differing religious backgrounds\nMy father was Episcopalian, my mother Catholic\nTheir union was not blessed within the Catholic Church\nThis approach seems contrary to their teachings of universal love\nBut the reality is, some practices appear antiquated yet persist\n\nI believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial\nBut I'm not convinced it would significantly mitigate issues of pedophilia\nGiven that such actions transcend marital status\nIt's likely such behavior would occur regardless of marital status\nThus, I don’t believe priests’ marital status would be a decisive factor in preventing such incidents",
            "I've yet to formulate a definitive stance on this matter. Both sides have compelling arguments, making it a complex issue. The crux of the debate lies in the delicate balance between church and state, and how to define marriage without causing offense. I believe that, given its nature, marriage should be recognized as a civil union by the government, just as it would for those who have been baptized. This approach avoids the complications of religious undertones and allows for uniform treatment. As for the federalization of marriage laws, it seems logical that all states would need to reach a consensus before such a measure is adopted. However, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. It's not a significant enough cause to warrant such a fundamental change to our constitution. It's simply not critical enough to amend the constitution for this purpose.",
            "I come from a home steeped in religious traditions, so the topic of homosexuality can be somewhat complex for me. I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ+, and while I may not fully align with their lifestyle, I do believe it should be legally recognized. I don't see this as a national issue that should be decided by the federal government. I think each state should have the autonomy to make this decision based on its own values and beliefs.\n\nMany states have diverse political leanings, with some being predominantly democratic and others republican. In a democratic state, it's understandable that there might be a push for LGBTQ+ rights. If you live in a state that chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it's only fair to respect that decision, as you've chosen to reside in that state. It's not about disagreeing with the state's decision but rather acknowledging the autonomy of the community that lives there.\n\nI strongly disagree with the notion that a president, particularly one who may not represent the views of all states, should impose his opinions on the entire nation, especially in matters as personal and diverse as this one. Bush's ban on same-sex marriage, for instance, doesn't align with my beliefs. I believe each state should have the power to decide what's best for its citizens, not a president who will soon be out of office. It would be unfair to leave such a significant decision to a federal power, given that the consequences will directly affect the citizens of that state, not the president himself.\n\nI hold the strong conviction that this matter should be left to the discretion of each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Well, I suppose I should address this point, as it's a significant issue. To begin, it's widely recognized that social media platforms, such as Myspace, are public forums. The very essence of these platforms is to enable individuals to share information with a broader audience, often the public. Hence, it's not an unreasonable expectation from the perspective of the school officials that they might come across such public postings on the internet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of school officials discovering potentially sensitive information, it's important to highlight the ethical balance between privacy and safety. On the one hand, students have a right to express themselves and share their thoughts publicly, as long as they're not violating any rules or laws. On the other hand, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its students, which may extend to monitoring online activities that could pose a threat to the school's security.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the intent behind the monitoring. If the school officials are merely snooping to catch students in potentially harmful activities, such as underage drinking or drug use, then it can indeed be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if their actions are driven by a genuine concern for student safety and to prevent tragedies like school shootings, then it becomes more about maintaining a secure learning environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the ethical line here is drawn when the school's actions align with the broader goal of making the school a safer place for all students. For instance, if the school officials have evidence or leads indicating that students might be at risk of harming themselves or others, their intervention would be justifiable. Conversely, if their actions are solely motivated by the desire to discipline students, it might cross the line into an invasion of privacy.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to understand that the internet is a vast and unforgiving virtual space. Once information is posted, it often stays there, making it difficult to erase or control. Therefore, students should always be cautious about what they share online, as it could potentially come back to haunt them later. This is a pertinent lesson I've learned from my experiences in public schools. We were often reminded about the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment, especially in the wake of tragic events like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that students have a right to privacy, I also believe that the school officials' actions should be guided by a genuine concern for the students' safety. The ultimate goal should be to create a learning environment that is both safe and nurturing, where students feel empowered to express themselves while being protected from potential harm.",
            "In retrospect, the initial sentiment was clear. The September 11th catastrophe was deeply personal. A part of me, caught up in the aftermath, yearned for retaliation. The idea of inflicting similar chaos abroad seemed like a just response. However, hindsight reveals that we may have acted on impulse rather than reason. The decision to intervene was driven by raw emotion, and I believe we underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nOur approach was hasty, lacking a coherent strategy. We entered the conflict unarmed with a comprehensive plan, assuming that our presence would engender order. Regrettably, the opposite occurred. The conflict grew, and our intervention proved ineffective.\n\nThe people we encountered were not merely adversaries but a people entrenched in their own strife. Their internal conflicts clouded their ability to engage with us meaningfully. Moreover, our presence exacerbated their divisions rather than uniting them against a common threat. It became evident that our intervention was not fostering unity but exacerbating divisions.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for military action was misplaced. We were driven by revenge rather than a clear mission. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq, in the heat of the moment, was understandable. Yet, I now question the wisdom of our actions. We failed to formulate a coherent plan for stabilization, and our presence only prolonged the chaos.\n\nThe war in Iraq did not yield the desired results. Our impact was minimal, and the country remains unstable. The notion of bringing democracy to a war-torn region was noble, but our execution was flawed. Our presence only prolonged the conflict and failed to achieve lasting change.\n\nI contend that we are not the agents capable of transforming these people. They must find their own solutions. Our continued presence in Iraq is futile. It is a drain on resources and a distraction from our domestic priorities.\n\nOur involvement has been lengthy, and our progress has been incremental. The situation has not improved significantly, and our continued presence only delays the inevitable. Ultimately, we must recognize that we cannot remain indefinitely. Our presence in Iraq is no longer serving a purpose."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To my view, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in a few key areas. It has been publicly discussed that the Church is experiencing a decline in membership, and I believe this could be due to its sometimes rigid stance on contemporary societal issues. Concerning matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, the Church holds steadfast views, which, while understandable, can come across as antiquated. If the Church were to embrace more current perspectives, I believe they might find their numbers growing again. Many people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to its views on these subjects, as they no longer align with their personal beliefs. For instance, those who support abortion and same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in an environment where these practices are deemed wrong. The Church's position on these issues is deeply rooted in its history and tradition. However, I don't see any inherent reason why the Church couldn't allow female priests or married priests. While these changes might not have prevented past controversies, they could potentially foster a more inclusive and accepting environment. In my estimation, the Church's dedication to its mission does not preclude it from also nurturing its flock with modern sensibilities.",
            "Certainly, I must preface by stating that I hold no qualms against same-sex marriage. Let us contemplate this matter. Is one's sexual orientation a conscious decision? I believe not. Being born with a particular inclination is hardly a choice one makes. Thus, it seems unjust to hold individuals accountable for their inherent nature. The assertion that only heterosexual unions are permissible while same-sex relationships are not, is, in my opinion, misguided. I have not deeply explored this topic, yet it is evident that the federal government's involvement is unwarranted. It is not a matter of security or moral concern, but rather a personal choice that should be left to the individuals in question.\n\nThe notion that one's sexual orientation is a choice is akin to suggesting that straight people choose to be straight. It is not a decision made, but a state of being. Therefore, it is incorrect to place responsibility on an individual for their sexuality. The federal government should not intervene in what is fundamentally a personal matter. It is not their place to impose their views or to dictate how individuals live their lives. This is not about moral judgment but about respecting the diversity of human nature. The law should not penalize those who are simply being true to themselves.\n\nIn essence, the federal government's involvement is misplaced. It is not a legal or moral responsibility of the state to dictate who can marry whom. It is a matter of personal choice and personal identity, and it is not something that the federal government should be involved in. To do so would be to overstep boundaries and to infringe upon individual rights.",
            "I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage, primarily because the current legal framework fails to account for the depth and complexity of these relationships. Many believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of these unions. The love and commitment between two consenting adults, regardless of their sexual orientation, are fundamentally similar to those shared between heterosexual couples.\n\nFor instance, marriage entitles couples to certain rights and benefits, such as tax breaks and healthcare coverage. When a same-sex couple is denied these rights, it leads to a form of institutionalized discrimination. The argument that marriage is a religious institution is flawed, as marriage is also a civil and legal one, separate from religious doctrine. It is hypocritical to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights while allowing them to form civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of same-sex couples on society, including adoption and community integration, are not supported by empirical evidence. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The federal government should play a pivotal role in ensuring that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have equal rights and protections.\n\nLastly, the opposition to same-sex marriage often hinges on misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked many of these myths, emphasizing that being gay is not a result of psychological trauma or defect. To make informed decisions, we should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or religious beliefs. The government should not dictate morality based on the principles of a particular religious group while ignoring the diverse moral and cultural perspectives of the broader society.",
            "To begin with, I am employed at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It goes without saying that the legality of a substance does not automatically negate its potential benefits, yet I strongly advocate against making it widely accessible to the public. However, for medicinal applications, I am a firm believer in its utility, despite its legal status. The mere fact that a substance is illegal does not make it beneficial. In the realm of pharmacology, we encounter numerous controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which are invaluable in patient care. Denying their benefits based solely on the stigma surrounding marijuana is shortsighted. The key is to embrace the medicinal properties of such substances while maintaining strict regulations to prevent abuse. Unlike alcohol, where overconsumption can lead to detrimental outcomes, marijuana's potential harm is less severe when compared to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. Therefore, gradually normalizing marijuana, starting with its medicinal use and removing the taboo associated with it, could lead to more responsible usage.",
            "The institution of the church has undergone significant modifications to align with the modern era. Its regulations are no longer as stringent as in the past. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with visits to church, and we would all don our finest, including myself. My attire consisted of cute little dresses, matching footwear, and a purse to complement the ensemble. However, my experience has evolved over the years. Now, the church caters to a more contemporary audience, with services tailored to suit the needs of teenagers, lasting a concise thirty minutes. Casual attire has become the norm, especially during summer weekends, where beach attire is not uncommon. Families often arrive late, adding a sense of informality to the proceedings. Even the traditionally formal morning masses have seen a shift towards more relaxed dress codes, with jeans and khakis becoming acceptable. While I acknowledge that this change has been the most noticeable, other aspects of the church remain shrouded in mystery to me. I am unfamiliar with its politics and internal workings.",
            "Initially, I found the original premise acceptable, but I believe the collective shock of the September 11th attacks lingered, and thus, the Iraq War was viewed through a different lens. Early on, the Bush administration linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim later proven false.\n\nThis misrepresentation grates on me, and the Iraq War continues to stir my ire. It seems the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public and has yet to take responsibility for this deception. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, has since expressed skepticism regarding the evidence.\n\nI view this as a dereliction of duty, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially post-September 11th. There's evidence suggesting the younger Bush sought to avenge his father's administration and expand our energy supply, which I find underhanded.\n\nHowever, I believe it's high time we reconsider our involvement. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths, the proposed alternative—a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also presents long-term challenges. The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and the political process faces significant friction.",
            "Let me start by saying that my perspective on the Iraq War is complex and multifaceted. Initially, I was not particularly invested in its progress, given that it was not a declared war in the traditional sense, but rather a response to recent events. My understanding is that it was more of a mission to hold Iraq accountable for suspected involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as to establish a stable, democratic government and ensure access to resources like oil.\n\nHowever, as time has passed, I've grown more critical of our continued presence there. The efforts to establish democracy have been slow and challenging, and I believe that our ongoing involvement is more about maintaining a presence in the region and securing resources than about genuinely helping Iraqis build a better future. I feel that our actions have created a sense of resentment among the local population, and our attempts to impose our values and systems have not necessarily been beneficial.\n\nMoreover, I question the wisdom of continuing a military presence in a region that is deeply divided by cultural, religious, and political beliefs. The situation in Iraq is far from stable and peaceful, and I worry that our continued involvement will only exacerbate the existing conflicts. I believe that it's crucial to reassess our strategy and consider a more nuanced approach that respects local cultures and values while still pursuing our broader geopolitical interests.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the Iraq War are still evolving. I am not convinced that our current approach is the best way to achieve our goals, and I believe that a more diplomatic and culturally sensitive strategy might yield better results in the long run. However, I also acknowledge the challenges involved in withdrawing from a complex and volatile situation.",
            "I must confess, I am not entirely convinced that this matter should be legally or statutorily sanctioned. The Constitution, in its wisdom, established a clear line between the state and religious institutions. I firmly believe it is the prerogative of denominations to regulate such issues.\n\nThe majority of Catholics and Christians, I am informed, are opposed to this. While it may be popular in some regions, such as Boston, the broader consensus among faith communities is against it. It seems to me that this is a matter best left to the discretion of religious bodies rather than the government. The principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American religious tolerance, and any amendment attempting to infringe upon it would be an affront to our founding principles.\n\nFurthermore, I do not see a compelling reason for the government to intervene in this matter. The proposed amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than any tangible benefit to society. I believe that leaving this matter to the individual consciences and the collective judgment of religious institutions would be a more fitting and respectful approach.",
            "The Iraq War\nIn hindsight, I question the American government's candor in communicating the true motivations behind our invasion of Iraq. The government suggested a connection between the 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict, yet this link was tenuous, if not non-existent. They exploited the collective outrage following 9/11 to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003. Personally, I was strongly opposed to the war, especially given the preemptive strike nature. The Iraq War, much like the Vietnam War, was a complex and protracted conflict. The U.S. government removed Iraq's government and attempted to impose a democratic regime, but they did not seem adequately prepared for the aftermath. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were not anticipated, and the U.S. struggled to maintain control and稍微 train local forces.\n\nThe war's similarity to Vietnam is striking. Both conflicts involved trying to install a democratic government in an environment filled with insurgents. The assumption that the process would be swift and successful was naïve. The U.S. underestimated the resilience and complexity of the task at hand, leading to a long and protracted conflict. The U.S. government's decision to engage was problematic, and their failure to plan comprehensive post-invasion strategies was a significant oversight.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to see the Iraq War to its conclusion. However, the high cost in American lives and the potential failure of the mission pose a dilemma. How far should we go to establish a democratic Iraq? The question of whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to see the war through remains unanswered. Additionally, the initial justification for the invasion, the search for weapons of mass destruction, was not borne out. While North Korea, known to possess such weapons, was left untouched, Iraq was invaded. The oil factor cannot be ignored, suggesting a strategic interest beyond democratic altruism.\n\nThe Iraq War is a controversial and complex issue, with no clear resolution in sight. While I hope for peace and stability, I remain skeptical that it will be achieved soon. The U.S. government's handling of the conflict and its motivations have been called into question, and the long-term consequences are still being felt.",
            "I have consistently supported the idea of same-sex marriage. It has always been a matter of personal preference, and I believe that recent scientific evidence points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, which is beyond individual control. I find it inhumane to deny rights based on something that is not controllable. In my neighborhood, we have a few openly gay couples who function as any other family would, and yet, they are not allowed to marry due to societal constraints. I believe it is unfair that our government, especially under Bush's interpretation of marriage, would interfere with personal choices that do not harm others. I've read extensively on the topic and understand that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors rather than upbringing. Marriage, in essence, is a private matter that should not be influenced by government intervention. It should be a personal decision made by individuals, not a public spectacle.",
            "It seems as though you've inadvertently ventured into uncharted waters by posting on the internet. The digital realm is, after all, an open forum. There's no escaping the fact that anything you share online becomes public, and your online persona can shape perceptions about you. For instance, an R.A. position required me to address such issues firsthand. When you share information online, it can influence people's views, and if it's about potentially dangerous topics, it can incite concern. The internet is universally accessible, and if someone at school receives a concerning post, they must act, as neglecting it could lead to unfortunate outcomes. However, discerning what's genuine and what's a prank can be challenging. For instance, a sociology experiment gone awry could seem serious until further context is provided. Thus, if you don't wish for something to be seen or misunderstood, refrain from posting it. It's essential to remember that what you share is your responsibility, and while schools and educators should respect privacy, they must also act when safety is at risk. For example, if a student's post hints at potential harm, it's the school's duty to investigate, even if it involves social media. It's crucial to maintain a healthy boundary regarding online monitoring, such as avoiding friend requests and private messages. However, if a concern is brought to their attention, schools have a responsibility to act, as privacy expectations are already altered when information is shared publicly. After all, it's not our place to police every detail of our residents' lives if it's irrelevant to our tasks.",
            "The conflict has stretched on far too long, I believe. Initially, the aim was commendable, to restore democratic governance in a nation lacking it. However, I suspect that the original intent has been lost over time. It seems we've deviated from our goal, now acting more as a global power display than a genuine effort to democratize. This war may have had personal undertones, given George W. Bush's father's history with Saddam Hussein. If the initial objective was to bring democracy to a repressed people, that could be justified. But with the passage of time, our reasons have become distorted and misguided, mirroring a desire to maintain a prolonged conflict. It's time to end this drawn-out war and redirect our resources to our own pressing issues such as poverty and infrastructure. We're squandering billions on a war that has lost its purpose, while our own citizens face challenges that need immediate attention. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on rebuilding our own country.",
            "Could I inquire about the reasoning behind the prevention?\n\nAh, I believe it was due to someone's online discovery.\n\nOf course, I see\nNo, I don't believe it constitutes a breach of privacy.\n\nOn platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. While you may need to be friends with users to view their profiles, you've essentially granted them permission. Thus, sharing information on the internet implies consent to its visibility.\n\nHowever, it's a challenging situation. While it's impractical for someone to monitor all students' profiles, targeted surveillance could seem discriminatory. Yet, it depends on the context. If the profile was flagged for potential threat or if someone was merely browsing and stumbled upon something concerning, it's understandable.\n\nI myself don't have a Myspace account, but I do use Facebook. I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are individuals who can access personal details about me. I've witnessed a TV program about a man who easily obtained a girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. While I would never meet someone under such circumstances, I've had classmates contact me via instant messenger, knowing my identity despite my limited sharing. They could gather information about my interests, appearance, schedule, and even my friends' details.\n\nI try to limit my posts, but I use it to communicate with friends, so I balance privacy with connectivity. I only accept requests from known individuals, but the uncertainty of unknown viewers remains.\n\nMy roommate shared her high school's experience where students were prohibited from using Myspace. I found this unusual; I'm uncertain of the school's authority to regulate students' online activities.\n\nThis is the only other thought that comes to mind.",

            "The situation seems to be that instead of fully legalizing it, they've opted to decriminalize it. This shift downgrades the infraction from a criminal offense to a minor one, akin to receiving a parking ticket rather than facing imprisonment. Should one be caught and cited, the repercussions, like those resulting from a drug charge, become less severe for job interviews and similar contexts. However, it's important to note that the future ramifications of such charges don't entirely vanish with decriminalization.\n\nMoreover, the cost of arresting, housing, and processing individuals is considerable. Municipalities facing financial strain may not be eager to bear these expenses, even if decriminalization could alleviate financial pressure. In a city like Denver, where the populace tends to lean towards more lenient views, the municipality benefits from reduced costs which can then be reallocated to public education, social programs for the elderly, or food programs for the homeless.\n\nWhile marijuana isn't something that should be widely available, the financial implications are significant. It's not just a matter of legalization affecting everyone equally. Some may continue to view it as taboo, making it less socially acceptable to have it openly available. On the other hand, the effects of substances like alcohol and marijuana can vary greatly from person to person. The impact on motor skills and lifestyle can differ based on individual reactions. Consequently, it's challenging to generalize the effects of such substances, but they certainly have their adverse impacts.",
            "I'd agree that\nA significant portion of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nFor instance, they've maintained these rituals over extended periods\nIt's commendable to anchor oneself in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to embrace adaptability\nMany Catholics believe in weekly church attendance\nWith a stringent adherence to ritualistic norms\nSometimes, this can feel exclusive and unyielding\nIntroducing non-conforming individuals can challenge their doctrines\nFor example, my parents' differing religious backgrounds\nMy father was Episcopalian, my mother Catholic\nTheir union was not blessed within the Catholic Church\nThis approach seems contrary to their teachings of universal love\nBut the reality is, some practices appear antiquated yet persist\n\nI believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial\nBut I'm not convinced it would significantly mitigate issues of pedophilia\nGiven that such actions transcend marital status\nIt's likely such behavior would occur regardless of marital status\nThus, I don’t believe priests’ marital status would be a decisive factor in preventing such incidents",
            "I've yet to formulate a definitive stance on this matter. Both sides have compelling arguments, making it a complex issue. The crux of the debate lies in the delicate balance between church and state, and how to define marriage without causing offense. I believe that, given its nature, marriage should be recognized as a civil union by the government, just as it would for those who have been baptized. This approach avoids the complications of religious undertones and allows for uniform treatment. As for the federalization of marriage laws, it seems logical that all states would need to reach a consensus before such a measure is adopted. However, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. It's not a significant enough cause to warrant such a fundamental change to our constitution. It's simply not critical enough to amend the constitution for this purpose.",
            "I come from a home steeped in religious traditions, so the topic of homosexuality can be somewhat complex for me. I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ+, and while I may not fully align with their lifestyle, I do believe it should be legally recognized. I don't see this as a national issue that should be decided by the federal government. I think each state should have the autonomy to make this decision based on its own values and beliefs.\n\nMany states have diverse political leanings, with some being predominantly democratic and others republican. In a democratic state, it's understandable that there might be a push for LGBTQ+ rights. If you live in a state that chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it's only fair to respect that decision, as you've chosen to reside in that state. It's not about disagreeing with the state's decision but rather acknowledging the autonomy of the community that lives there.\n\nI strongly disagree with the notion that a president, particularly one who may not represent the views of all states, should impose his opinions on the entire nation, especially in matters as personal and diverse as this one. Bush's ban on same-sex marriage, for instance, doesn't align with my beliefs. I believe each state should have the power to decide what's best for its citizens, not a president who will soon be out of office. It would be unfair to leave such a significant decision to a federal power, given that the consequences will directly affect the citizens of that state, not the president himself.\n\nI hold the strong conviction that this matter should be left to the discretion of each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Well, I suppose I should address this point, as it's a significant issue. To begin, it's widely recognized that social media platforms, such as Myspace, are public forums. The very essence of these platforms is to enable individuals to share information with a broader audience, often the public. Hence, it's not an unreasonable expectation from the perspective of the school officials that they might come across such public postings on the internet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of school officials discovering potentially sensitive information, it's important to highlight the ethical balance between privacy and safety. On the one hand, students have a right to express themselves and share their thoughts publicly, as long as they're not violating any rules or laws. On the other hand, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its students, which may extend to monitoring online activities that could pose a threat to the school's security.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the intent behind the monitoring. If the school officials are merely snooping to catch students in potentially harmful activities, such as underage drinking or drug use, then it can indeed be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if their actions are driven by a genuine concern for student safety and to prevent tragedies like school shootings, then it becomes more about maintaining a secure learning environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the ethical line here is drawn when the school's actions align with the broader goal of making the school a safer place for all students. For instance, if the school officials have evidence or leads indicating that students might be at risk of harming themselves or others, their intervention would be justifiable. Conversely, if their actions are solely motivated by the desire to discipline students, it might cross the line into an invasion of privacy.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to understand that the internet is a vast and unforgiving virtual space. Once information is posted, it often stays there, making it difficult to erase or control. Therefore, students should always be cautious about what they share online, as it could potentially come back to haunt them later. This is a pertinent lesson I've learned from my experiences in public schools. We were often reminded about the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment, especially in the wake of tragic events like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that students have a right to privacy, I also believe that the school officials' actions should be guided by a genuine concern for the students' safety. The ultimate goal should be to create a learning environment that is both safe and nurturing, where students feel empowered to express themselves while being protected from potential harm.",
            "In retrospect, the initial sentiment was clear. The September 11th catastrophe was deeply personal. A part of me, caught up in the aftermath, yearned for retaliation. The idea of inflicting similar chaos abroad seemed like a just response. However, hindsight reveals that we may have acted on impulse rather than reason. The decision to intervene was driven by raw emotion, and I believe we underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nOur approach was hasty, lacking a coherent strategy. We entered the conflict unarmed with a comprehensive plan, assuming that our presence would engender order. Regrettably, the opposite occurred. The conflict grew, and our intervention proved ineffective.\n\nThe people we encountered were not merely adversaries but a people entrenched in their own strife. Their internal conflicts clouded their ability to engage with us meaningfully. Moreover, our presence exacerbated their divisions rather than uniting them against a common threat. It became evident that our intervention was not fostering unity but exacerbating divisions.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for military action was misplaced. We were driven by revenge rather than a clear mission. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq, in the heat of the moment, was understandable. Yet, I now question the wisdom of our actions. We failed to formulate a coherent plan for stabilization, and our presence only prolonged the chaos.\n\nThe war in Iraq did not yield the desired results. Our impact was minimal, and the country remains unstable. The notion of bringing democracy to a war-torn region was noble, but our execution was flawed. Our presence only prolonged the conflict and failed to achieve lasting change.\n\nI contend that we are not the agents capable of transforming these people. They must find their own solutions. Our continued presence in Iraq is futile. It is a drain on resources and a distraction from our domestic priorities.\n\nOur involvement has been lengthy, and our progress has been incremental. The situation has not improved significantly, and our continued presence only delays the inevitable. Ultimately, we must recognize that we cannot remain indefinitely. Our presence in Iraq is no longer serving a purpose."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "To my view, the Catholic Church could stand to evolve in a few key areas. It has been publicly discussed that the Church is experiencing a decline in membership, and I believe this could be due to its sometimes rigid stance on contemporary societal issues. Concerning matters such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control, the Church holds steadfast views, which, while understandable, can come across as antiquated. If the Church were to embrace more current perspectives, I believe they might find their numbers growing again. Many people are beginning to distance themselves from the Church due to its views on these subjects, as they no longer align with their personal beliefs. For instance, those who support abortion and same-sex marriage might feel uncomfortable in an environment where these practices are deemed wrong. The Church's position on these issues is deeply rooted in its history and tradition. However, I don't see any inherent reason why the Church couldn't allow female priests or married priests. While these changes might not have prevented past controversies, they could potentially foster a more inclusive and accepting environment. In my estimation, the Church's dedication to its mission does not preclude it from also nurturing its flock with modern sensibilities.",
            "Certainly, I must preface by stating that I hold no qualms against same-sex marriage. Let us contemplate this matter. Is one's sexual orientation a conscious decision? I believe not. Being born with a particular inclination is hardly a choice one makes. Thus, it seems unjust to hold individuals accountable for their inherent nature. The assertion that only heterosexual unions are permissible while same-sex relationships are not, is, in my opinion, misguided. I have not deeply explored this topic, yet it is evident that the federal government's involvement is unwarranted. It is not a matter of security or moral concern, but rather a personal choice that should be left to the individuals in question.\n\nThe notion that one's sexual orientation is a choice is akin to suggesting that straight people choose to be straight. It is not a decision made, but a state of being. Therefore, it is incorrect to place responsibility on an individual for their sexuality. The federal government should not intervene in what is fundamentally a personal matter. It is not their place to impose their views or to dictate how individuals live their lives. This is not about moral judgment but about respecting the diversity of human nature. The law should not penalize those who are simply being true to themselves.\n\nIn essence, the federal government's involvement is misplaced. It is not a legal or moral responsibility of the state to dictate who can marry whom. It is a matter of personal choice and personal identity, and it is not something that the federal government should be involved in. To do so would be to overstep boundaries and to infringe upon individual rights.",
            "I strongly advocate for the legalization of same-sex marriage, primarily because the current legal framework fails to account for the depth and complexity of these relationships. Many believe that same-sex couples pose a threat to traditional family structures. However, this perspective overlooks the multifaceted nature of these unions. The love and commitment between two consenting adults, regardless of their sexual orientation, are fundamentally similar to those shared between heterosexual couples.\n\nFor instance, marriage entitles couples to certain rights and benefits, such as tax breaks and healthcare coverage. When a same-sex couple is denied these rights, it leads to a form of institutionalized discrimination. The argument that marriage is a religious institution is flawed, as marriage is also a civil and legal one, separate from religious doctrine. It is hypocritical to deny same-sex couples the same legal rights while allowing them to form civil unions or domestic partnerships.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of same-sex couples on society, including adoption and community integration, are not supported by empirical evidence. Research has shown that children raised by same-sex parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. The federal government should play a pivotal role in ensuring that all couples, regardless of their sexual orientation, have equal rights and protections.\n\nLastly, the opposition to same-sex marriage often hinges on misconceptions about the causes of homosexuality. The American Psychological Association has debunked many of these myths, emphasizing that being gay is not a result of psychological trauma or defect. To make informed decisions, we should rely on scientific research rather than popular opinion or religious beliefs. The government should not dictate morality based on the principles of a particular religious group while ignoring the diverse moral and cultural perspectives of the broader society.",
            "To begin with, I am employed at a hospital pharmacy during the summer. It goes without saying that the legality of a substance does not automatically negate its potential benefits, yet I strongly advocate against making it widely accessible to the public. However, for medicinal applications, I am a firm believer in its utility, despite its legal status. The mere fact that a substance is illegal does not make it beneficial. In the realm of pharmacology, we encounter numerous controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and percocet, which are invaluable in patient care. Denying their benefits based solely on the stigma surrounding marijuana is shortsighted. The key is to embrace the medicinal properties of such substances while maintaining strict regulations to prevent abuse. Unlike alcohol, where overconsumption can lead to detrimental outcomes, marijuana's potential harm is less severe when compared to harder drugs like heroin or cocaine. Therefore, gradually normalizing marijuana, starting with its medicinal use and removing the taboo associated with it, could lead to more responsible usage.",
            "The institution of the church has undergone significant modifications to align with the modern era. Its regulations are no longer as stringent as in the past. When I was younger, Sundays were filled with visits to church, and we would all don our finest, including myself. My attire consisted of cute little dresses, matching footwear, and a purse to complement the ensemble. However, my experience has evolved over the years. Now, the church caters to a more contemporary audience, with services tailored to suit the needs of teenagers, lasting a concise thirty minutes. Casual attire has become the norm, especially during summer weekends, where beach attire is not uncommon. Families often arrive late, adding a sense of informality to the proceedings. Even the traditionally formal morning masses have seen a shift towards more relaxed dress codes, with jeans and khakis becoming acceptable. While I acknowledge that this change has been the most noticeable, other aspects of the church remain shrouded in mystery to me. I am unfamiliar with its politics and internal workings.",
            "Initially, I found the original premise acceptable, but I believe the collective shock of the September 11th attacks lingered, and thus, the Iraq War was viewed through a different lens. Early on, the Bush administration linked Iraq to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks, claiming Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, a claim later proven false.\n\nThis misrepresentation grates on me, and the Iraq War continues to stir my ire. It seems the Bush administration intentionally misled the American public and has yet to take responsibility for this deception. Even Colin Powell, who presented the case at the UN, has since expressed skepticism regarding the evidence.\n\nI view this as a dereliction of duty, an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is evident, especially post-September 11th. There's evidence suggesting the younger Bush sought to avenge his father's administration and expand our energy supply, which I find underhanded.\n\nHowever, I believe it's high time we reconsider our involvement. While a sudden withdrawal could lead to civil war and more deaths, the proposed alternative—a coalition of nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also presents long-term challenges. The interim government's effectiveness is questionable, and the political process faces significant friction.",
            "Let me start by saying that my perspective on the Iraq War is complex and multifaceted. Initially, I was not particularly invested in its progress, given that it was not a declared war in the traditional sense, but rather a response to recent events. My understanding is that it was more of a mission to hold Iraq accountable for suspected involvement in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, as well as to establish a stable, democratic government and ensure access to resources like oil.\n\nHowever, as time has passed, I've grown more critical of our continued presence there. The efforts to establish democracy have been slow and challenging, and I believe that our ongoing involvement is more about maintaining a presence in the region and securing resources than about genuinely helping Iraqis build a better future. I feel that our actions have created a sense of resentment among the local population, and our attempts to impose our values and systems have not necessarily been beneficial.\n\nMoreover, I question the wisdom of continuing a military presence in a region that is deeply divided by cultural, religious, and political beliefs. The situation in Iraq is far from stable and peaceful, and I worry that our continued involvement will only exacerbate the existing conflicts. I believe that it's crucial to reassess our strategy and consider a more nuanced approach that respects local cultures and values while still pursuing our broader geopolitical interests.\n\nIn conclusion, my thoughts on the Iraq War are still evolving. I am not convinced that our current approach is the best way to achieve our goals, and I believe that a more diplomatic and culturally sensitive strategy might yield better results in the long run. However, I also acknowledge the challenges involved in withdrawing from a complex and volatile situation.",
            "I must confess, I am not entirely convinced that this matter should be legally or statutorily sanctioned. The Constitution, in its wisdom, established a clear line between the state and religious institutions. I firmly believe it is the prerogative of denominations to regulate such issues.\n\nThe majority of Catholics and Christians, I am informed, are opposed to this. While it may be popular in some regions, such as Boston, the broader consensus among faith communities is against it. It seems to me that this is a matter best left to the discretion of religious bodies rather than the government. The principle of separation of church and state is a cornerstone of American religious tolerance, and any amendment attempting to infringe upon it would be an affront to our founding principles.\n\nFurthermore, I do not see a compelling reason for the government to intervene in this matter. The proposed amendment appears to be driven by personal beliefs rather than any tangible benefit to society. I believe that leaving this matter to the individual consciences and the collective judgment of religious institutions would be a more fitting and respectful approach.",
            "The Iraq War\nIn hindsight, I question the American government's candor in communicating the true motivations behind our invasion of Iraq. The government suggested a connection between the 2001 terrorist attacks and the Iraq conflict, yet this link was tenuous, if not non-existent. They exploited the collective outrage following 9/11 to rally support for the invasion, which began in 2003. Personally, I was strongly opposed to the war, especially given the preemptive strike nature. The Iraq War, much like the Vietnam War, was a complex and protracted conflict. The U.S. government removed Iraq's government and attempted to impose a democratic regime, but they did not seem adequately prepared for the aftermath. The resulting power vacuum and chaos were not anticipated, and the U.S. struggled to maintain control and稍微 train local forces.\n\nThe war's similarity to Vietnam is striking. Both conflicts involved trying to install a democratic government in an environment filled with insurgents. The assumption that the process would be swift and successful was naïve. The U.S. underestimated the resilience and complexity of the task at hand, leading to a long and protracted conflict. The U.S. government's decision to engage was problematic, and their failure to plan comprehensive post-invasion strategies was a significant oversight.\n\nDuring the 2004 presidential election, I considered voting for George Bush to allow him to see the Iraq War to its conclusion. However, the high cost in American lives and the potential failure of the mission pose a dilemma. How far should we go to establish a democratic Iraq? The question of whether the U.S. has a moral obligation to see the war through remains unanswered. Additionally, the initial justification for the invasion, the search for weapons of mass destruction, was not borne out. While North Korea, known to possess such weapons, was left untouched, Iraq was invaded. The oil factor cannot be ignored, suggesting a strategic interest beyond democratic altruism.\n\nThe Iraq War is a controversial and complex issue, with no clear resolution in sight. While I hope for peace and stability, I remain skeptical that it will be achieved soon. The U.S. government's handling of the conflict and its motivations have been called into question, and the long-term consequences are still being felt.",
            "I have consistently supported the idea of same-sex marriage. It has always been a matter of personal preference, and I believe that recent scientific evidence points to a biological basis for sexual orientation, which is beyond individual control. I find it inhumane to deny rights based on something that is not controllable. In my neighborhood, we have a few openly gay couples who function as any other family would, and yet, they are not allowed to marry due to societal constraints. I believe it is unfair that our government, especially under Bush's interpretation of marriage, would interfere with personal choices that do not harm others. I've read extensively on the topic and understand that sexual orientation might be influenced by biological factors rather than upbringing. Marriage, in essence, is a private matter that should not be influenced by government intervention. It should be a personal decision made by individuals, not a public spectacle.",
            "It seems as though you've inadvertently ventured into uncharted waters by posting on the internet. The digital realm is, after all, an open forum. There's no escaping the fact that anything you share online becomes public, and your online persona can shape perceptions about you. For instance, an R.A. position required me to address such issues firsthand. When you share information online, it can influence people's views, and if it's about potentially dangerous topics, it can incite concern. The internet is universally accessible, and if someone at school receives a concerning post, they must act, as neglecting it could lead to unfortunate outcomes. However, discerning what's genuine and what's a prank can be challenging. For instance, a sociology experiment gone awry could seem serious until further context is provided. Thus, if you don't wish for something to be seen or misunderstood, refrain from posting it. It's essential to remember that what you share is your responsibility, and while schools and educators should respect privacy, they must also act when safety is at risk. For example, if a student's post hints at potential harm, it's the school's duty to investigate, even if it involves social media. It's crucial to maintain a healthy boundary regarding online monitoring, such as avoiding friend requests and private messages. However, if a concern is brought to their attention, schools have a responsibility to act, as privacy expectations are already altered when information is shared publicly. After all, it's not our place to police every detail of our residents' lives if it's irrelevant to our tasks.",
            "The conflict has stretched on far too long, I believe. Initially, the aim was commendable, to restore democratic governance in a nation lacking it. However, I suspect that the original intent has been lost over time. It seems we've deviated from our goal, now acting more as a global power display than a genuine effort to democratize. This war may have had personal undertones, given George W. Bush's father's history with Saddam Hussein. If the initial objective was to bring democracy to a repressed people, that could be justified. But with the passage of time, our reasons have become distorted and misguided, mirroring a desire to maintain a prolonged conflict. It's time to end this drawn-out war and redirect our resources to our own pressing issues such as poverty and infrastructure. We're squandering billions on a war that has lost its purpose, while our own citizens face challenges that need immediate attention. It's time to bring our troops home and focus on rebuilding our own country.",
            "Could I inquire about the reasoning behind the prevention?\n\nAh, I believe it was due to someone's online discovery.\n\nOf course, I see\nNo, I don't believe it constitutes a breach of privacy.\n\nOn platforms like Myspace, if you post information, it becomes accessible to a wide audience. While you may need to be friends with users to view their profiles, you've essentially granted them permission. Thus, sharing information on the internet implies consent to its visibility.\n\nHowever, it's a challenging situation. While it's impractical for someone to monitor all students' profiles, targeted surveillance could seem discriminatory. Yet, it depends on the context. If the profile was flagged for potential threat or if someone was merely browsing and stumbled upon something concerning, it's understandable.\n\nI myself don't have a Myspace account, but I do use Facebook. I'm uncomfortable knowing that there are individuals who can access personal details about me. I've witnessed a TV program about a man who easily obtained a girl's screen name and convinced her to meet him within minutes. While I would never meet someone under such circumstances, I've had classmates contact me via instant messenger, knowing my identity despite my limited sharing. They could gather information about my interests, appearance, schedule, and even my friends' details.\n\nI try to limit my posts, but I use it to communicate with friends, so I balance privacy with connectivity. I only accept requests from known individuals, but the uncertainty of unknown viewers remains.\n\nMy roommate shared her high school's experience where students were prohibited from using Myspace. I found this unusual; I'm uncertain of the school's authority to regulate students' online activities.\n\nThis is the only other thought that comes to mind.",

            "The situation seems to be that instead of fully legalizing it, they've opted to decriminalize it. This shift downgrades the infraction from a criminal offense to a minor one, akin to receiving a parking ticket rather than facing imprisonment. Should one be caught and cited, the repercussions, like those resulting from a drug charge, become less severe for job interviews and similar contexts. However, it's important to note that the future ramifications of such charges don't entirely vanish with decriminalization.\n\nMoreover, the cost of arresting, housing, and processing individuals is considerable. Municipalities facing financial strain may not be eager to bear these expenses, even if decriminalization could alleviate financial pressure. In a city like Denver, where the populace tends to lean towards more lenient views, the municipality benefits from reduced costs which can then be reallocated to public education, social programs for the elderly, or food programs for the homeless.\n\nWhile marijuana isn't something that should be widely available, the financial implications are significant. It's not just a matter of legalization affecting everyone equally. Some may continue to view it as taboo, making it less socially acceptable to have it openly available. On the other hand, the effects of substances like alcohol and marijuana can vary greatly from person to person. The impact on motor skills and lifestyle can differ based on individual reactions. Consequently, it's challenging to generalize the effects of such substances, but they certainly have their adverse impacts.",
            "I'd agree that\nA significant portion of their practices are deeply rooted in tradition\nFor instance, they've maintained these rituals over extended periods\nIt's commendable to anchor oneself in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to embrace adaptability\nMany Catholics believe in weekly church attendance\nWith a stringent adherence to ritualistic norms\nSometimes, this can feel exclusive and unyielding\nIntroducing non-conforming individuals can challenge their doctrines\nFor example, my parents' differing religious backgrounds\nMy father was Episcopalian, my mother Catholic\nTheir union was not blessed within the Catholic Church\nThis approach seems contrary to their teachings of universal love\nBut the reality is, some practices appear antiquated yet persist\n\nI believe allowing priests to marry could be beneficial\nBut I'm not convinced it would significantly mitigate issues of pedophilia\nGiven that such actions transcend marital status\nIt's likely such behavior would occur regardless of marital status\nThus, I don’t believe priests’ marital status would be a decisive factor in preventing such incidents",
            "I've yet to formulate a definitive stance on this matter. Both sides have compelling arguments, making it a complex issue. The crux of the debate lies in the delicate balance between church and state, and how to define marriage without causing offense. I believe that, given its nature, marriage should be recognized as a civil union by the government, just as it would for those who have been baptized. This approach avoids the complications of religious undertones and allows for uniform treatment. As for the federalization of marriage laws, it seems logical that all states would need to reach a consensus before such a measure is adopted. However, I strongly oppose any constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. It's not a significant enough cause to warrant such a fundamental change to our constitution. It's simply not critical enough to amend the constitution for this purpose.",
            "I come from a home steeped in religious traditions, so the topic of homosexuality can be somewhat complex for me. I have many friends who identify as LGBTQ+, and while I may not fully align with their lifestyle, I do believe it should be legally recognized. I don't see this as a national issue that should be decided by the federal government. I think each state should have the autonomy to make this decision based on its own values and beliefs.\n\nMany states have diverse political leanings, with some being predominantly democratic and others republican. In a democratic state, it's understandable that there might be a push for LGBTQ+ rights. If you live in a state that chooses to legalize same-sex marriage, it's only fair to respect that decision, as you've chosen to reside in that state. It's not about disagreeing with the state's decision but rather acknowledging the autonomy of the community that lives there.\n\nI strongly disagree with the notion that a president, particularly one who may not represent the views of all states, should impose his opinions on the entire nation, especially in matters as personal and diverse as this one. Bush's ban on same-sex marriage, for instance, doesn't align with my beliefs. I believe each state should have the power to decide what's best for its citizens, not a president who will soon be out of office. It would be unfair to leave such a significant decision to a federal power, given that the consequences will directly affect the citizens of that state, not the president himself.\n\nI hold the strong conviction that this matter should be left to the discretion of each individual state, as they are the ones who will have to live with the consequences of their decision.",
            "Well, I suppose I should address this point, as it's a significant issue. To begin, it's widely recognized that social media platforms, such as Myspace, are public forums. The very essence of these platforms is to enable individuals to share information with a broader audience, often the public. Hence, it's not an unreasonable expectation from the perspective of the school officials that they might come across such public postings on the internet.\n\nNow, considering the possibility of school officials discovering potentially sensitive information, it's important to highlight the ethical balance between privacy and safety. On the one hand, students have a right to express themselves and share their thoughts publicly, as long as they're not violating any rules or laws. On the other hand, the school has a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of its students, which may extend to monitoring online activities that could pose a threat to the school's security.\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the intent behind the monitoring. If the school officials are merely snooping to catch students in potentially harmful activities, such as underage drinking or drug use, then it can indeed be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, if their actions are driven by a genuine concern for student safety and to prevent tragedies like school shootings, then it becomes more about maintaining a secure learning environment.\n\nIn my opinion, the ethical line here is drawn when the school's actions align with the broader goal of making the school a safer place for all students. For instance, if the school officials have evidence or leads indicating that students might be at risk of harming themselves or others, their intervention would be justifiable. Conversely, if their actions are solely motivated by the desire to discipline students, it might cross the line into an invasion of privacy.\n\nMoreover, it's crucial to understand that the internet is a vast and unforgiving virtual space. Once information is posted, it often stays there, making it difficult to erase or control. Therefore, students should always be cautious about what they share online, as it could potentially come back to haunt them later. This is a pertinent lesson I've learned from my experiences in public schools. We were often reminded about the importance of maintaining a safe and secure environment, especially in the wake of tragic events like the Columbine shooting.\n\nIn conclusion, while I agree that students have a right to privacy, I also believe that the school officials' actions should be guided by a genuine concern for the students' safety. The ultimate goal should be to create a learning environment that is both safe and nurturing, where students feel empowered to express themselves while being protected from potential harm.",
            "In retrospect, the initial sentiment was clear. The September 11th catastrophe was deeply personal. A part of me, caught up in the aftermath, yearned for retaliation. The idea of inflicting similar chaos abroad seemed like a just response. However, hindsight reveals that we may have acted on impulse rather than reason. The decision to intervene was driven by raw emotion, and I believe we underestimated the complexity of the situation.\n\nOur approach was hasty, lacking a coherent strategy. We entered the conflict unarmed with a comprehensive plan, assuming that our presence would engender order. Regrettably, the opposite occurred. The conflict grew, and our intervention proved ineffective.\n\nThe people we encountered were not merely adversaries but a people entrenched in their own strife. Their internal conflicts clouded their ability to engage with us meaningfully. Moreover, our presence exacerbated their divisions rather than uniting them against a common threat. It became evident that our intervention was not fostering unity but exacerbating divisions.\n\nThe initial enthusiasm for military action was misplaced. We were driven by revenge rather than a clear mission. President Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq, in the heat of the moment, was understandable. Yet, I now question the wisdom of our actions. We failed to formulate a coherent plan for stabilization, and our presence only prolonged the chaos.\n\nThe war in Iraq did not yield the desired results. Our impact was minimal, and the country remains unstable. The notion of bringing democracy to a war-torn region was noble, but our execution was flawed. Our presence only prolonged the conflict and failed to achieve lasting change.\n\nI contend that we are not the agents capable of transforming these people. They must find their own solutions. Our continued presence in Iraq is futile. It is a drain on resources and a distraction from our domestic priorities.\n\nOur involvement has been lengthy, and our progress has been incremental. The situation has not improved significantly, and our continued presence only delays the inevitable. Ultimately, we must recognize that we cannot remain indefinitely. Our presence in Iraq is no longer serving a purpose."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in my opinion, could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. It's been noted that the Church's following is declining, and I believe this may be due to its sometimes rigid views on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. These views, while deeply rooted in tradition, might seem outdated to some. By adopting a more contemporary perspective, the Church could potentially retain and even attract more followers. The Church's stance on these matters has led some to question and even dissent from its teachings, with many feeling that the Church holds views that differ from their own. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might struggle to align with a Church that strongly opposes these practices. While I don't believe that allowing female priests or married clergy would necessarily address this issue, I do question why these changes haven't been considered. The Church's current practice of celibacy for priests, which is seen as a devotion to God, seems at odds with the concept of a balanced life that includes both work and family. It's an open question whether the Church's traditional views might be more flexible, and I'm not convinced that these proposed changes would have significantly altered the situation.",
            "Certainly, I should preface this by saying that my views on this matter are rather straightforward. I harbor no reservations about same-sex matrimony. I maintain that one's sexual orientation is not something that is chosen. It is innate, something with which one is born. I believe that individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation, as it is not a conscious decision. It's unfair to assert that a union between two individuals of the same sex is inferior to a union between a man and woman. I have not extensively delved into this topic, but I would strongly argue that it is wrong to make such a claim.\n\nI assert that sexual orientation is not a choice. It is analogous to one being born with certain physical traits. I was born heterosexual, and others may be born gay. This is not a conscious choice, and it seems unjust to hold such individuals responsible for their orientation. I firmly believe that the federal government should not intervene in this matter. It is not a legal or moral issue that concerns our nation's security. It is a personal aspect of one's identity, and the government should not meddle in such private matters. It is not their prerogative to judge or penalize individuals based on their sexual orientation. This is simply who they are, and they should not be punished for it.\n\nUltimately, it is not a matter for the federal government to address. It is a personal decision, and the government should respect that. I do not believe they have the right to interfere or impose their views on others. Let us allow individuals the freedom to live their lives as they see fit without government intrusion.",
            "It is my firm conviction that the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only justifiable but also imperative. The impetus for this belief lies in the absence of substantial arguments against it. Many individuals view homosexual couples as a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this perspective is oversimplified and misguided. Same-sex relationships are inherently different and multifaceted, much like the two sides of a coin—heads and tails, each distinct yet complementary.\n\nMoreover, numerous civil rights, such as property tax benefits and health care provisions, are contingent upon the legal recognition of these relationships. For instance, in the absence of legal recognition, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to visit a hospital room or make crucial medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This is illogical and unfair, especially when considering the lifetime commitment and shared responsibilities inherent in these relationships.\n\nExtensive scientific research has demonstrated that same-sex couples exhibit the same success rates and satisfactions in relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. The crux of the matter is that these couples are seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, rather than a religious ceremony. The separation of church and state should preclude any objection based on religious grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should play a pivotal role in this debate. The antiquated amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage should be repealed in favor of a more inclusive policy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that President Bush's views on this issue are deeply influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. While I am not deeply engaged in political discourse, it appears that these views are largely rooted in moral considerations, which are inherently subjective and vary among individuals.\n\nIt is concerning that many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological trauma or a personality defect, as posited by some religious communities. This notion has been debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association, which has issued statements refuting these claims. It is crucial for society to rely on empirical evidence rather than popular opinions or cultural norms that perpetuate misconceptions and prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a recognition of the fundamental human desire for equality and dignified partnerships. The federal government should lead the way in ensuring that these rights are uniformly protected in every state, fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
            "In my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a peculiar dichotomy. While certain drugs, deemed illicit, possess inherent benefits, their availability to the public can be a contentious issue. However, for medicinal purposes, I contend their usage should be considered. For instance, substances like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets are controlled substances, yet they're often utilized due to their therapeutic benefits. Denying these benefits merely because of societal stigma is counterintuitive. I advocate for a gradual integration of marijuana into the legal framework, rather than a wholesale legalization, to mitigate potential abuse. The negative perception of marijuana, as an illegal drug, hinders its responsible utilization. I believe, by addressing this stigma, people can adopt a more nuanced understanding, potentially allowing for its medicinal use.",
            "Personally, I believe the church has evolved to meet the demands of the 21st century. The atmosphere is less stringent compared to the past. When I was young, Sundays at church were a routine, complete with cute dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. Back then, everyone was dressed up, including my friends from private school who joined me on weekends. Now, however, things have changed significantly. There's a youth service that's only thirty minutes, and attire is much more casual, especially during the summer with beach clothes being common. Families often arrive late, and even morning masses have seen a relaxation in dress code. Jeans and khakis are now acceptable, though khakis have their own charm. The church I'm familiar with is focused on this adaptation, but I'm unsure about the church's political or theological intricacies.\n\nRegarding allegations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't believe changes like female ordination or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and who are attracted to children aren't necessarily cured by marriage. The inclination seems to be rooted in genetics, not upbringing. While the church might have been aware and tried to cover it up in some cases, I think the primary factor is the individual's nature, which is unlikely to change through marriage.\n\nI don't have any further thoughts on the Catholic Church",
            "In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the initial reception of the Iraq War's rationale was accepting, yet the passage of time has shed light on the deeper motives and missteps. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and the assertion of weapons of mass destruction proved to be baseless, heightening my skepticism. The administration's dishonesty and disregard for the Constitution are evident, as former Secretary of State Colin Powell now admits to not being convinced by the presented evidence. This, to me, constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, the younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and the ulterior motive of expanding energy supply, are clear. Despite the lengthy duration of the conflict, I believe immediate withdrawal could lead to a civil war and increased casualties. The proposed coalition of Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order seems inadequate, as it could exacerbate the sovereignty issue and further complicate the political landscape. The interim government's ineffectiveness, with Prime Minister's waning control and radical elements vying for power, highlights the dire state of the political process.",
            "I've been struggling with the premise of the question. Let's begin by acknowledging that the conflict in Iraq is a complex issue. I must admit, I don't have a deep understanding of the specifics; it's not a topic I frequently engage with. At its core though, I believe the Iraq War was initiated based on the premise that Iraq was behind the September 11 attacks. However, I'm unconvinced that this initial reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as Iraq was never properly deemed a state of war by Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq, not because of any moral or ethical stance, but because I think it's a waste of resources and a futile effort to impose our political system on another country. I do not believe in the claim that the U.S. should be in the business of creating democracies abroad, especially when it results in our military being tied up in a region that's been plagued by conflict for decades. Furthermore, I believe that our continued presence in Iraq is merely to secure access to oil, which is a shortsighted and selfish goal. I'm not sure how to feel about the war ending or continuing; it's a complex situation. On one hand, I understand the desire to protect our troops and support them through their service. On the other hand, I can't ignore the fact that our presence is exacerbating the conflict and causing more harm than good. I don't have a clear solution, but I do believe that it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the region.",
            "The notion of legalizing or declaring it as legal by the state seems misguided, in my opinion. The constitution's principle of separation of church and state is quite explicit. I believe the decision should rest with the churches, not the government. Attempting to exert control over this matter would disregard the constitution's clear guidelines. It's akin to favoring one church's beliefs over others, as seen with the predominantly Catholic and Christian stance against it. The federal government should not interject, as this is more about personal religious views than a matter of public policy. Proposing an amendment solely based on personal beliefs would be contradictory to the constitution and potentially restrictive. The economy and society could even benefit from its legalization, though the specifics are unclear. I've expressed my viewpoint.",
            "The conflict in Iraq, it's a complex issue, and I believe there are aspects of it that the administration didn't fully disclose to the American public prior to the invasion. The invasion, which began in 2003, was portrayed as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, yet the connection between the two events was tenuous at best. The government exploited the public's emotional response to the attacks to garner support for the war. Personally, I am opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, mirrors the Vietnam War. The government's focus on removing the Iraqi government and installing a democratic regime seems to be a replay of their strategy in Vietnam. The aftermath of such actions is often chaotic and unpredictable, and the U.S. government did not adequately plan for it. The U.S. has now been involved in Iraq for nearly three years, with numerous American lives lost, and the country is still grappling with instability. The transition to democracy is a lengthy process, and it's not as straightforward as the government made it seem. The U.S. should have been more prepared for the complexities of rebuilding a nation. The decision to invade Iraq was difficult, especially considering the high cost in American lives and the uncertain success of the mission. The issue of oil resources is a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy, and the search for weapons of mass destruction turned out to be unfounded. While I hope for a swift resolution, I don't foresee immediate peace in Iraq.",
            "I must confess, I'm an advocate for same-sex marriage. I have always held this belief and it's strengthened over time. I believe it's a deeply personal choice, not something that should be influenced by societal norms or political interference. It's been scientifically proven that sexual orientation can have biological roots, making it unfair to deny individuals rights they didn't choose.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand, in my own neighborhood, openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and are active members of the community. It's hardly something that requires government or political involvement.\n\nPresident Bush's attempt to define marriage according to his interpretation is, in my opinion, misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a personal choice, not a political one. It should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. The media's tendency to sensationalize same-sex marriages is a clear indication of this.\n\nI've read numerous studies and articles suggesting that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological predispositions, not solely by upbringing. If a person is predisposed to be homosexual, it's akin to any other inherent trait, no more controllable than the color of one's eyes. Yet, we see a double standard when it comes to same-sex marriage.\n\nI'm not sure I can express it any clearer. Same-sex marriage should be a private, personal decision, not a national or political one. It's a basic right to choose who you want to spend your life with, regardless of gender.",
            "In the contemporary landscape of digital communication, it's crucial to recognize that anything posted online is inherently public. When one shares content on the internet, it becomes accessible to an extensive audience, including those who might interpret it in ways unintended. As a Resident Advisor, I've encountered this firsthand; the impact of internet statements can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, discussing sensitive topics like violence or potential threats is not advisable, as it can attract unwanted attention from concerned parties. It's essential to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can shape perceptions and indeed influence actions. In the case of a past incident at my school, information about a threat was brought to the school's attention, leading to a thorough investigation. While privacy concerns are valid, if dangers are implied, it's imperative for authorities to take these concerns seriously. However, it's also essential to differentiate between genuine threats and playful remarks, as some individuals may use social media to share jokes or conduct experiments without cause for alarm. In conclusion, while it's vital to respect privacy, sharing sensitive information online can lead to unintended consequences, necessitating caution and responsible use of digital platforms.",
            "It seems the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the intent was commendable: to instill democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, I posit that our focus has shifted, and the original purpose has been diluted. It appears we may have become entangled in the endeavor for the sake of asserting our global supremacy, with considerations of personal interests potentially tainting the initial resolve.\n\nFurthermore, the protracted duration of the conflict is problematic. While the entrance into war was a clear assertion of our purpose, the sustained engagement suggests a deterioration of our original cause. It seems the war has become an end in itself, with an insistence on a decisive conclusion or victory clouding our judgment.\n\nI believe it is time to reevaluate our engagement. Continuing to pour resources into this conflict, while our own economy and social infrastructure languish, is unsustainable. We have ample domestic issues—poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—that demand our attention. It is high time we allow the local government to assume responsibility for its fate and redirect our allocation towards addressing our own pressing needs.",
            "Could you assist in clearing up a query regarding the circumstances that led to a specific prevention? On the internet, it seems that information is often accessible to a broad audience. For instance, on platforms such as Myspace, while certain profiles may require a member to view them, this implies a form of consent, as one would need to accept that person as a \"friend\" to access their profile. Posting information online essentially entails an understanding that a multitude of individuals may view it. The notion of someone intercepting and utilizing such data to prevent a life-threatening situation is intriguing. However, the practicality of having a single individual monitor all student profiles is impractical and could potentially lead to discriminatory practices. The situation could be complex, with profiles being accessed either randomly or intentionally for specific evidence. My own Facebook experience has taught me to be cautious about the personal data I share. It's a delicate balance between staying connected with friends and safeguarding my privacy. While I've accepted requests from those I know, it's unnerving to realize that strangers might have access to details about my daily routine and interests. My roommate shared that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace, which struck me as an odd restriction, as I'm unsure of how educational authorities could enforce such a policy. It's a nuanced issue with no clear-cut solution.",
            "In contemplation, I must address the Iraq War once more, a topic that I find myself hesitant to revisit. I was opposed to it initially, but its significance seems to have faded. The prevailing consensus, both domestically and abroad, regards it as a misguided venture. Polls from the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a staggering eighty percent belief that the invasion was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed there today suggest that withdrawal should commence within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been chaotic from the outset, with no clear path forward. The cultural chasm between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations is immense, and attempts to impose Western ideals are met with resistance. Saddam Hussein's regime may have been reprehensible, but the consequences of invasion far outweigh potential benefits. It is akin to walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nI struggle to find a compelling reason to prolong our involvement. The administration's justification for staying has yet to be substantiated. A phased withdrawal over a year or more might be plausible, but I question the urgency of an immediate departure. It appears that Iraqi citizens themselves, those we aim to help, desire our departure. Their counsel, if sought, could absolve us from responsibility if things deteriorate further. While we may never be viewed as benevolent in the Middle East, a swift exit would certainly alleviate our current predicament.",
            "Indeed, it is my conviction that gender discrimination remains a tangible issue in the United States. It is not merely confined to the female gender; rather, it extends across various professional domains. For instance, in industries where women are historically underrepresented, there exists a persistent bias. This is evidenced by the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women, though possessing the necessary qualifications, face barriers to advancement. This societal mindset, shaped by decades of tradition, often prevents women from reaching higher positions, despite their capabilities.\n\nMoreover, men also face discrimination in certain fields. For example, the fashion industry often regards male professionals with skepticism. This is due to the perception that men in fashion are not as well-versed in the female consumer perspective. Additionally, men who opt to stay at home to care for their children, despite their partners' higher earning potential, often encounter societal disapproval and scrutiny. Society frequently expects men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to a misconception that men not fulfilling this role are not contributing to their families.\n\nHowever, change is gradual. While women are increasingly occupying leadership roles and being accepted in the corporate world, these shifts have been slow. Similarly, the acceptance of men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, is also evolving. The fashion industry is beginning to recognize the value of male perspectives, particularly when informed by female relationships.\n\nDespite these improvements, discrimination based on both gender and regional backgrounds persists. For example, an individual from a rural background with excellent intelligence but subpar grammar may face skepticism in the workplace. This highlights the multifaceted nature of discrimination in the United States. While we have made significant strides since the 19th century, change remains a gradual process. It is essential to continue promoting diversity and inclusion incrementally, without forcing societal shifts too rapidly, to ensure sustainable progress.",
            "In my comprehension, the state has not legalized marijuana, but rather decriminalized it. This change in legal status means that possessing small amounts of marijuana is treated similarly to a traffic citation, rather than a criminal offense. This shift in policy aims to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it avoids the need for arrests, trials, and the appointment of public defenders. Consequently, it also reduces the financial strain on municipalities, allowing them to redirect resources towards more pressing needs, like education and social programs. However, it's important to note that while decriminalization can alleviate some of the societal burdens associated with marijuana use, it doesn't entirely eliminate potential future consequences, such as employment discrimination. Moreover, the widespread use of marijuana in public spaces remains a contentious issue, as it may be seen as inappropriate or unacceptable in certain contexts. Additionally, while both marijuana and alcohol can impair decision-making and motor skills, their effects vary greatly among individuals. Some people may be able to manage their use responsibly, while others may struggle with addiction or misuse. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana on a person's life depends on their personal characteristics and behavior.",
            "I must admit, the traditional practices within the Catholic Church, while rooted in history, can sometimes feel static and resistant to change. While it is commendable to maintain these long-standing customs, I believe it is equally essential to be adaptable and inclusive in our approach. Consider, for instance, the weekly church attendance expected of Catholics. This rigidity can sometimes seem exclusionary, particularly to those who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine. This strict adherence can extend to a lack of acceptance towards individuals from other faiths, such as my father, who was an Episcopalian, and his inability to wed my mother, a Catholic, within the Church. This stance, while traditional, can appear contradictory to the core teaching of loving others, regardless of their faith. I feel that the Church's practices often lag behind its principles, creating a disconnect between the two.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of priestly celibacy, while deeply ingrained, does not necessarily correlate with the prevalence of child molestation. Allowing priests to marry, I believe, would neither deter nor encourage such behavior. Pedophilia is a separate issue, unrelated to marital status. Thus, I do not see this as a viable solution to prevent such occurrences. In essence, the Church's refusal to adapt its practices to contemporary standards may sometimes hinder its ability to reach diverse communities, despite its well-intentioned teachings.",
            "I have yet to form a definitive opinion on this subject matter. Consequently, I find it challenging to assert that either side holds the correct perspective. However, I believe this issue to be particularly complex due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without causing offense to any group. I am uncertain whether civil unions should be recognized by the government, akin to how religious ceremonies like baptism are not. If individuals are married, I believe they should be viewed as having entered into a civil union, as that is the most accurate description of their relationship. I do not envision the government inquiring into the nature of their union or its religious basis. In regards to gay marriage, I see it simply as two people entering into a civil union. If all states could reach a consensus on this matter, it should be made a federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. The constitution should not be amended for such a significant cause, as it would be too divisive. It is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. Simply put, I do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage.",
            "Growing up in a household that adheres to Christian principles, my perspective on the topic of homosexuality is somewhat nuanced. I have several friends who identify as gay, and while I myself do not subscribe to their lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized. I believe this decision should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government.\n\nFor instance, many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, which means they tend to lean towards a particular political stance. If you choose to live in a state that leans Democratic, for example, you are likely aware of its stance on issues like gay marriage. I believe that individuals should respect the choice of their state rather than attempting to argue against it.\n\nMoreover, I think it is crucial that homosexuals be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. Therefore, I feel that the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. I firmly believe that President Bush does not have the mandate to impose his views on the entire country. Instead, I believe that the decision should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will ultimately be impacted by their own choice.\n\nIn two years, when Bush is no longer in office, a Democratic president may choose to lift the ban on gay marriage. This would simply lead to a political tug-of-war, with the decision constantly shifting. I believe it is far more practical to allow each state to make its own decision, as they are the ones who will truly live with the consequences.",
            "Um, I'd like to clarify a few points. Firstly, I don't believe in the notion that social media platforms like Myspace are inherently private. A bulletin board, by definition, is for public consumption. If one posts something on the internet, they must understand that it becomes publicly accessible, regardless of the platform. Consequently, school officials have a right to view this information, even if it's not under the school's name. They can access it from their personal devices, which they do at home. However, I see it differently when it comes to preventing school shootings. If accessing such information helps ensure student safety and safeguards the school environment, it's reasonable. This is the responsibility of the school system. Yet, I draw the line when officials actively use these platforms to catch students in misconduct. That, in my opinion, infringes on privacy. However, if the purpose is to enhance safety and security, it's acceptable. I've considered this with a teacher, and we discussed the need for such measures, especially after the Columbine incident. We practiced drills to maintain safety, similar to the school's role in preventing tragedies. Hence, I believe the officials were acting within their mandate to keep the school a safe haven for students.",
            "Initially, the events of September 11th deeply impacted me, fueling my desire for swift retribution. However, as time passed, I came to realize that our actions were rushed and ill-prepared. The emotional fervor that initially drove us to invade Iraq ultimately led to a complex situation that we were ill-equipped to handle. The lack of a clear plan and understanding of the cultural and political landscape proved detrimental. I now believe that our involvement has not only failed to achieve the desired results but has also exacerbated the situation. The inherent instability and factions within the region make it clear that our presence is not facilitating peace or progress. Instead, it keeps the focus on our presence rather than addressing the core issues. It is my firm belief that our intervention has been more harmful than helpful, and I advocate for a more strategic and nuanced approach. The complexities of the region and the nature of the conflict require a long-term strategy rather than a quick, emotional response.\n\nThe consequences of our actions are evident in the ongoing turmoil and lack of progress. The people of Iraq have their own battles to fight, and our presence does not seem to be aiding their self-determination. The initial impulse to act was understandable, but our actions have not been aligned with a rational, long-term vision. I now regret the lack of a cohesive plan and the emotional underpinnings of our initial response. The inherent divisions and chaos in the region suggest that our involvement has been counterproductive. It is crucial to reassess our strategy and consider the long-term implications of our actions. The people of Iraq need to find their own path to peace and stability, and our continued presence may be hindering that process. A more strategic and deliberate approach is necessary to address the underlying issues and facilitate genuine progress."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in my opinion, could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. It's been noted that the Church's following is declining, and I believe this may be due to its sometimes rigid views on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. These views, while deeply rooted in tradition, might seem outdated to some. By adopting a more contemporary perspective, the Church could potentially retain and even attract more followers. The Church's stance on these matters has led some to question and even dissent from its teachings, with many feeling that the Church holds views that differ from their own. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might struggle to align with a Church that strongly opposes these practices. While I don't believe that allowing female priests or married clergy would necessarily address this issue, I do question why these changes haven't been considered. The Church's current practice of celibacy for priests, which is seen as a devotion to God, seems at odds with the concept of a balanced life that includes both work and family. It's an open question whether the Church's traditional views might be more flexible, and I'm not convinced that these proposed changes would have significantly altered the situation.",
            "Certainly, I should preface this by saying that my views on this matter are rather straightforward. I harbor no reservations about same-sex matrimony. I maintain that one's sexual orientation is not something that is chosen. It is innate, something with which one is born. I believe that individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation, as it is not a conscious decision. It's unfair to assert that a union between two individuals of the same sex is inferior to a union between a man and woman. I have not extensively delved into this topic, but I would strongly argue that it is wrong to make such a claim.\n\nI assert that sexual orientation is not a choice. It is analogous to one being born with certain physical traits. I was born heterosexual, and others may be born gay. This is not a conscious choice, and it seems unjust to hold such individuals responsible for their orientation. I firmly believe that the federal government should not intervene in this matter. It is not a legal or moral issue that concerns our nation's security. It is a personal aspect of one's identity, and the government should not meddle in such private matters. It is not their prerogative to judge or penalize individuals based on their sexual orientation. This is simply who they are, and they should not be punished for it.\n\nUltimately, it is not a matter for the federal government to address. It is a personal decision, and the government should respect that. I do not believe they have the right to interfere or impose their views on others. Let us allow individuals the freedom to live their lives as they see fit without government intrusion.",
            "It is my firm conviction that the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only justifiable but also imperative. The impetus for this belief lies in the absence of substantial arguments against it. Many individuals view homosexual couples as a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this perspective is oversimplified and misguided. Same-sex relationships are inherently different and multifaceted, much like the two sides of a coin—heads and tails, each distinct yet complementary.\n\nMoreover, numerous civil rights, such as property tax benefits and health care provisions, are contingent upon the legal recognition of these relationships. For instance, in the absence of legal recognition, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to visit a hospital room or make crucial medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This is illogical and unfair, especially when considering the lifetime commitment and shared responsibilities inherent in these relationships.\n\nExtensive scientific research has demonstrated that same-sex couples exhibit the same success rates and satisfactions in relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. The crux of the matter is that these couples are seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, rather than a religious ceremony. The separation of church and state should preclude any objection based on religious grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should play a pivotal role in this debate. The antiquated amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage should be repealed in favor of a more inclusive policy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that President Bush's views on this issue are deeply influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. While I am not deeply engaged in political discourse, it appears that these views are largely rooted in moral considerations, which are inherently subjective and vary among individuals.\n\nIt is concerning that many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological trauma or a personality defect, as posited by some religious communities. This notion has been debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association, which has issued statements refuting these claims. It is crucial for society to rely on empirical evidence rather than popular opinions or cultural norms that perpetuate misconceptions and prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a recognition of the fundamental human desire for equality and dignified partnerships. The federal government should lead the way in ensuring that these rights are uniformly protected in every state, fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
            "In my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a peculiar dichotomy. While certain drugs, deemed illicit, possess inherent benefits, their availability to the public can be a contentious issue. However, for medicinal purposes, I contend their usage should be considered. For instance, substances like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets are controlled substances, yet they're often utilized due to their therapeutic benefits. Denying these benefits merely because of societal stigma is counterintuitive. I advocate for a gradual integration of marijuana into the legal framework, rather than a wholesale legalization, to mitigate potential abuse. The negative perception of marijuana, as an illegal drug, hinders its responsible utilization. I believe, by addressing this stigma, people can adopt a more nuanced understanding, potentially allowing for its medicinal use.",
            "Personally, I believe the church has evolved to meet the demands of the 21st century. The atmosphere is less stringent compared to the past. When I was young, Sundays at church were a routine, complete with cute dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. Back then, everyone was dressed up, including my friends from private school who joined me on weekends. Now, however, things have changed significantly. There's a youth service that's only thirty minutes, and attire is much more casual, especially during the summer with beach clothes being common. Families often arrive late, and even morning masses have seen a relaxation in dress code. Jeans and khakis are now acceptable, though khakis have their own charm. The church I'm familiar with is focused on this adaptation, but I'm unsure about the church's political or theological intricacies.\n\nRegarding allegations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't believe changes like female ordination or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and who are attracted to children aren't necessarily cured by marriage. The inclination seems to be rooted in genetics, not upbringing. While the church might have been aware and tried to cover it up in some cases, I think the primary factor is the individual's nature, which is unlikely to change through marriage.\n\nI don't have any further thoughts on the Catholic Church",
            "In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the initial reception of the Iraq War's rationale was accepting, yet the passage of time has shed light on the deeper motives and missteps. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and the assertion of weapons of mass destruction proved to be baseless, heightening my skepticism. The administration's dishonesty and disregard for the Constitution are evident, as former Secretary of State Colin Powell now admits to not being convinced by the presented evidence. This, to me, constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, the younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and the ulterior motive of expanding energy supply, are clear. Despite the lengthy duration of the conflict, I believe immediate withdrawal could lead to a civil war and increased casualties. The proposed coalition of Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order seems inadequate, as it could exacerbate the sovereignty issue and further complicate the political landscape. The interim government's ineffectiveness, with Prime Minister's waning control and radical elements vying for power, highlights the dire state of the political process.",
            "I've been struggling with the premise of the question. Let's begin by acknowledging that the conflict in Iraq is a complex issue. I must admit, I don't have a deep understanding of the specifics; it's not a topic I frequently engage with. At its core though, I believe the Iraq War was initiated based on the premise that Iraq was behind the September 11 attacks. However, I'm unconvinced that this initial reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as Iraq was never properly deemed a state of war by Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq, not because of any moral or ethical stance, but because I think it's a waste of resources and a futile effort to impose our political system on another country. I do not believe in the claim that the U.S. should be in the business of creating democracies abroad, especially when it results in our military being tied up in a region that's been plagued by conflict for decades. Furthermore, I believe that our continued presence in Iraq is merely to secure access to oil, which is a shortsighted and selfish goal. I'm not sure how to feel about the war ending or continuing; it's a complex situation. On one hand, I understand the desire to protect our troops and support them through their service. On the other hand, I can't ignore the fact that our presence is exacerbating the conflict and causing more harm than good. I don't have a clear solution, but I do believe that it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the region.",
            "The notion of legalizing or declaring it as legal by the state seems misguided, in my opinion. The constitution's principle of separation of church and state is quite explicit. I believe the decision should rest with the churches, not the government. Attempting to exert control over this matter would disregard the constitution's clear guidelines. It's akin to favoring one church's beliefs over others, as seen with the predominantly Catholic and Christian stance against it. The federal government should not interject, as this is more about personal religious views than a matter of public policy. Proposing an amendment solely based on personal beliefs would be contradictory to the constitution and potentially restrictive. The economy and society could even benefit from its legalization, though the specifics are unclear. I've expressed my viewpoint.",
            "The conflict in Iraq, it's a complex issue, and I believe there are aspects of it that the administration didn't fully disclose to the American public prior to the invasion. The invasion, which began in 2003, was portrayed as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, yet the connection between the two events was tenuous at best. The government exploited the public's emotional response to the attacks to garner support for the war. Personally, I am opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, mirrors the Vietnam War. The government's focus on removing the Iraqi government and installing a democratic regime seems to be a replay of their strategy in Vietnam. The aftermath of such actions is often chaotic and unpredictable, and the U.S. government did not adequately plan for it. The U.S. has now been involved in Iraq for nearly three years, with numerous American lives lost, and the country is still grappling with instability. The transition to democracy is a lengthy process, and it's not as straightforward as the government made it seem. The U.S. should have been more prepared for the complexities of rebuilding a nation. The decision to invade Iraq was difficult, especially considering the high cost in American lives and the uncertain success of the mission. The issue of oil resources is a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy, and the search for weapons of mass destruction turned out to be unfounded. While I hope for a swift resolution, I don't foresee immediate peace in Iraq.",
            "I must confess, I'm an advocate for same-sex marriage. I have always held this belief and it's strengthened over time. I believe it's a deeply personal choice, not something that should be influenced by societal norms or political interference. It's been scientifically proven that sexual orientation can have biological roots, making it unfair to deny individuals rights they didn't choose.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand, in my own neighborhood, openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and are active members of the community. It's hardly something that requires government or political involvement.\n\nPresident Bush's attempt to define marriage according to his interpretation is, in my opinion, misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a personal choice, not a political one. It should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. The media's tendency to sensationalize same-sex marriages is a clear indication of this.\n\nI've read numerous studies and articles suggesting that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological predispositions, not solely by upbringing. If a person is predisposed to be homosexual, it's akin to any other inherent trait, no more controllable than the color of one's eyes. Yet, we see a double standard when it comes to same-sex marriage.\n\nI'm not sure I can express it any clearer. Same-sex marriage should be a private, personal decision, not a national or political one. It's a basic right to choose who you want to spend your life with, regardless of gender.",
            "In the contemporary landscape of digital communication, it's crucial to recognize that anything posted online is inherently public. When one shares content on the internet, it becomes accessible to an extensive audience, including those who might interpret it in ways unintended. As a Resident Advisor, I've encountered this firsthand; the impact of internet statements can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, discussing sensitive topics like violence or potential threats is not advisable, as it can attract unwanted attention from concerned parties. It's essential to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can shape perceptions and indeed influence actions. In the case of a past incident at my school, information about a threat was brought to the school's attention, leading to a thorough investigation. While privacy concerns are valid, if dangers are implied, it's imperative for authorities to take these concerns seriously. However, it's also essential to differentiate between genuine threats and playful remarks, as some individuals may use social media to share jokes or conduct experiments without cause for alarm. In conclusion, while it's vital to respect privacy, sharing sensitive information online can lead to unintended consequences, necessitating caution and responsible use of digital platforms.",
            "It seems the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the intent was commendable: to instill democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, I posit that our focus has shifted, and the original purpose has been diluted. It appears we may have become entangled in the endeavor for the sake of asserting our global supremacy, with considerations of personal interests potentially tainting the initial resolve.\n\nFurthermore, the protracted duration of the conflict is problematic. While the entrance into war was a clear assertion of our purpose, the sustained engagement suggests a deterioration of our original cause. It seems the war has become an end in itself, with an insistence on a decisive conclusion or victory clouding our judgment.\n\nI believe it is time to reevaluate our engagement. Continuing to pour resources into this conflict, while our own economy and social infrastructure languish, is unsustainable. We have ample domestic issues—poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—that demand our attention. It is high time we allow the local government to assume responsibility for its fate and redirect our allocation towards addressing our own pressing needs.",
            "Could you assist in clearing up a query regarding the circumstances that led to a specific prevention? On the internet, it seems that information is often accessible to a broad audience. For instance, on platforms such as Myspace, while certain profiles may require a member to view them, this implies a form of consent, as one would need to accept that person as a \"friend\" to access their profile. Posting information online essentially entails an understanding that a multitude of individuals may view it. The notion of someone intercepting and utilizing such data to prevent a life-threatening situation is intriguing. However, the practicality of having a single individual monitor all student profiles is impractical and could potentially lead to discriminatory practices. The situation could be complex, with profiles being accessed either randomly or intentionally for specific evidence. My own Facebook experience has taught me to be cautious about the personal data I share. It's a delicate balance between staying connected with friends and safeguarding my privacy. While I've accepted requests from those I know, it's unnerving to realize that strangers might have access to details about my daily routine and interests. My roommate shared that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace, which struck me as an odd restriction, as I'm unsure of how educational authorities could enforce such a policy. It's a nuanced issue with no clear-cut solution.",
            "In contemplation, I must address the Iraq War once more, a topic that I find myself hesitant to revisit. I was opposed to it initially, but its significance seems to have faded. The prevailing consensus, both domestically and abroad, regards it as a misguided venture. Polls from the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a staggering eighty percent belief that the invasion was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed there today suggest that withdrawal should commence within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been chaotic from the outset, with no clear path forward. The cultural chasm between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations is immense, and attempts to impose Western ideals are met with resistance. Saddam Hussein's regime may have been reprehensible, but the consequences of invasion far outweigh potential benefits. It is akin to walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nI struggle to find a compelling reason to prolong our involvement. The administration's justification for staying has yet to be substantiated. A phased withdrawal over a year or more might be plausible, but I question the urgency of an immediate departure. It appears that Iraqi citizens themselves, those we aim to help, desire our departure. Their counsel, if sought, could absolve us from responsibility if things deteriorate further. While we may never be viewed as benevolent in the Middle East, a swift exit would certainly alleviate our current predicament.",
            "Indeed, it is my conviction that gender discrimination remains a tangible issue in the United States. It is not merely confined to the female gender; rather, it extends across various professional domains. For instance, in industries where women are historically underrepresented, there exists a persistent bias. This is evidenced by the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women, though possessing the necessary qualifications, face barriers to advancement. This societal mindset, shaped by decades of tradition, often prevents women from reaching higher positions, despite their capabilities.\n\nMoreover, men also face discrimination in certain fields. For example, the fashion industry often regards male professionals with skepticism. This is due to the perception that men in fashion are not as well-versed in the female consumer perspective. Additionally, men who opt to stay at home to care for their children, despite their partners' higher earning potential, often encounter societal disapproval and scrutiny. Society frequently expects men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to a misconception that men not fulfilling this role are not contributing to their families.\n\nHowever, change is gradual. While women are increasingly occupying leadership roles and being accepted in the corporate world, these shifts have been slow. Similarly, the acceptance of men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, is also evolving. The fashion industry is beginning to recognize the value of male perspectives, particularly when informed by female relationships.\n\nDespite these improvements, discrimination based on both gender and regional backgrounds persists. For example, an individual from a rural background with excellent intelligence but subpar grammar may face skepticism in the workplace. This highlights the multifaceted nature of discrimination in the United States. While we have made significant strides since the 19th century, change remains a gradual process. It is essential to continue promoting diversity and inclusion incrementally, without forcing societal shifts too rapidly, to ensure sustainable progress.",
            "In my comprehension, the state has not legalized marijuana, but rather decriminalized it. This change in legal status means that possessing small amounts of marijuana is treated similarly to a traffic citation, rather than a criminal offense. This shift in policy aims to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it avoids the need for arrests, trials, and the appointment of public defenders. Consequently, it also reduces the financial strain on municipalities, allowing them to redirect resources towards more pressing needs, like education and social programs. However, it's important to note that while decriminalization can alleviate some of the societal burdens associated with marijuana use, it doesn't entirely eliminate potential future consequences, such as employment discrimination. Moreover, the widespread use of marijuana in public spaces remains a contentious issue, as it may be seen as inappropriate or unacceptable in certain contexts. Additionally, while both marijuana and alcohol can impair decision-making and motor skills, their effects vary greatly among individuals. Some people may be able to manage their use responsibly, while others may struggle with addiction or misuse. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana on a person's life depends on their personal characteristics and behavior.",
            "I must admit, the traditional practices within the Catholic Church, while rooted in history, can sometimes feel static and resistant to change. While it is commendable to maintain these long-standing customs, I believe it is equally essential to be adaptable and inclusive in our approach. Consider, for instance, the weekly church attendance expected of Catholics. This rigidity can sometimes seem exclusionary, particularly to those who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine. This strict adherence can extend to a lack of acceptance towards individuals from other faiths, such as my father, who was an Episcopalian, and his inability to wed my mother, a Catholic, within the Church. This stance, while traditional, can appear contradictory to the core teaching of loving others, regardless of their faith. I feel that the Church's practices often lag behind its principles, creating a disconnect between the two.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of priestly celibacy, while deeply ingrained, does not necessarily correlate with the prevalence of child molestation. Allowing priests to marry, I believe, would neither deter nor encourage such behavior. Pedophilia is a separate issue, unrelated to marital status. Thus, I do not see this as a viable solution to prevent such occurrences. In essence, the Church's refusal to adapt its practices to contemporary standards may sometimes hinder its ability to reach diverse communities, despite its well-intentioned teachings.",
            "I have yet to form a definitive opinion on this subject matter. Consequently, I find it challenging to assert that either side holds the correct perspective. However, I believe this issue to be particularly complex due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without causing offense to any group. I am uncertain whether civil unions should be recognized by the government, akin to how religious ceremonies like baptism are not. If individuals are married, I believe they should be viewed as having entered into a civil union, as that is the most accurate description of their relationship. I do not envision the government inquiring into the nature of their union or its religious basis. In regards to gay marriage, I see it simply as two people entering into a civil union. If all states could reach a consensus on this matter, it should be made a federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. The constitution should not be amended for such a significant cause, as it would be too divisive. It is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. Simply put, I do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage.",
            "Growing up in a household that adheres to Christian principles, my perspective on the topic of homosexuality is somewhat nuanced. I have several friends who identify as gay, and while I myself do not subscribe to their lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized. I believe this decision should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government.\n\nFor instance, many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, which means they tend to lean towards a particular political stance. If you choose to live in a state that leans Democratic, for example, you are likely aware of its stance on issues like gay marriage. I believe that individuals should respect the choice of their state rather than attempting to argue against it.\n\nMoreover, I think it is crucial that homosexuals be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. Therefore, I feel that the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. I firmly believe that President Bush does not have the mandate to impose his views on the entire country. Instead, I believe that the decision should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will ultimately be impacted by their own choice.\n\nIn two years, when Bush is no longer in office, a Democratic president may choose to lift the ban on gay marriage. This would simply lead to a political tug-of-war, with the decision constantly shifting. I believe it is far more practical to allow each state to make its own decision, as they are the ones who will truly live with the consequences.",
            "Um, I'd like to clarify a few points. Firstly, I don't believe in the notion that social media platforms like Myspace are inherently private. A bulletin board, by definition, is for public consumption. If one posts something on the internet, they must understand that it becomes publicly accessible, regardless of the platform. Consequently, school officials have a right to view this information, even if it's not under the school's name. They can access it from their personal devices, which they do at home. However, I see it differently when it comes to preventing school shootings. If accessing such information helps ensure student safety and safeguards the school environment, it's reasonable. This is the responsibility of the school system. Yet, I draw the line when officials actively use these platforms to catch students in misconduct. That, in my opinion, infringes on privacy. However, if the purpose is to enhance safety and security, it's acceptable. I've considered this with a teacher, and we discussed the need for such measures, especially after the Columbine incident. We practiced drills to maintain safety, similar to the school's role in preventing tragedies. Hence, I believe the officials were acting within their mandate to keep the school a safe haven for students.",
            "Initially, the events of September 11th deeply impacted me, fueling my desire for swift retribution. However, as time passed, I came to realize that our actions were rushed and ill-prepared. The emotional fervor that initially drove us to invade Iraq ultimately led to a complex situation that we were ill-equipped to handle. The lack of a clear plan and understanding of the cultural and political landscape proved detrimental. I now believe that our involvement has not only failed to achieve the desired results but has also exacerbated the situation. The inherent instability and factions within the region make it clear that our presence is not facilitating peace or progress. Instead, it keeps the focus on our presence rather than addressing the core issues. It is my firm belief that our intervention has been more harmful than helpful, and I advocate for a more strategic and nuanced approach. The complexities of the region and the nature of the conflict require a long-term strategy rather than a quick, emotional response.\n\nThe consequences of our actions are evident in the ongoing turmoil and lack of progress. The people of Iraq have their own battles to fight, and our presence does not seem to be aiding their self-determination. The initial impulse to act was understandable, but our actions have not been aligned with a rational, long-term vision. I now regret the lack of a cohesive plan and the emotional underpinnings of our initial response. The inherent divisions and chaos in the region suggest that our involvement has been counterproductive. It is crucial to reassess our strategy and consider the long-term implications of our actions. The people of Iraq need to find their own path to peace and stability, and our continued presence may be hindering that process. A more strategic and deliberate approach is necessary to address the underlying issues and facilitate genuine progress."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church, in my opinion, could benefit from some adjustments to its stance on certain issues. It's been noted that the Church's following is declining, and I believe this may be due to its sometimes rigid views on topics such as same-sex marriage, abortion, and contraception. These views, while deeply rooted in tradition, might seem outdated to some. By adopting a more contemporary perspective, the Church could potentially retain and even attract more followers. The Church's stance on these matters has led some to question and even dissent from its teachings, with many feeling that the Church holds views that differ from their own. For instance, if someone supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might struggle to align with a Church that strongly opposes these practices. While I don't believe that allowing female priests or married clergy would necessarily address this issue, I do question why these changes haven't been considered. The Church's current practice of celibacy for priests, which is seen as a devotion to God, seems at odds with the concept of a balanced life that includes both work and family. It's an open question whether the Church's traditional views might be more flexible, and I'm not convinced that these proposed changes would have significantly altered the situation.",
            "Certainly, I should preface this by saying that my views on this matter are rather straightforward. I harbor no reservations about same-sex matrimony. I maintain that one's sexual orientation is not something that is chosen. It is innate, something with which one is born. I believe that individuals should not be held accountable for their sexual orientation, as it is not a conscious decision. It's unfair to assert that a union between two individuals of the same sex is inferior to a union between a man and woman. I have not extensively delved into this topic, but I would strongly argue that it is wrong to make such a claim.\n\nI assert that sexual orientation is not a choice. It is analogous to one being born with certain physical traits. I was born heterosexual, and others may be born gay. This is not a conscious choice, and it seems unjust to hold such individuals responsible for their orientation. I firmly believe that the federal government should not intervene in this matter. It is not a legal or moral issue that concerns our nation's security. It is a personal aspect of one's identity, and the government should not meddle in such private matters. It is not their prerogative to judge or penalize individuals based on their sexual orientation. This is simply who they are, and they should not be punished for it.\n\nUltimately, it is not a matter for the federal government to address. It is a personal decision, and the government should respect that. I do not believe they have the right to interfere or impose their views on others. Let us allow individuals the freedom to live their lives as they see fit without government intrusion.",
            "It is my firm conviction that the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only justifiable but also imperative. The impetus for this belief lies in the absence of substantial arguments against it. Many individuals view homosexual couples as a threat to traditional heterosexual families, but this perspective is oversimplified and misguided. Same-sex relationships are inherently different and multifaceted, much like the two sides of a coin—heads and tails, each distinct yet complementary.\n\nMoreover, numerous civil rights, such as property tax benefits and health care provisions, are contingent upon the legal recognition of these relationships. For instance, in the absence of legal recognition, a partner in a same-sex relationship may be denied the right to visit a hospital room or make crucial medical decisions on behalf of their partner. This is illogical and unfair, especially when considering the lifetime commitment and shared responsibilities inherent in these relationships.\n\nExtensive scientific research has demonstrated that same-sex couples exhibit the same success rates and satisfactions in relationships as their heterosexual counterparts. The crux of the matter is that these couples are seeking a marriage certificate, a legal document provided by the government, rather than a religious ceremony. The separation of church and state should preclude any objection based on religious grounds.\n\nFurthermore, the federal government should play a pivotal role in this debate. The antiquated amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage should be repealed in favor of a more inclusive policy. However, it is essential to acknowledge that President Bush's views on this issue are deeply influenced by his religious beliefs, similar to his stance on abortion and stem cell research. While I am not deeply engaged in political discourse, it appears that these views are largely rooted in moral considerations, which are inherently subjective and vary among individuals.\n\nIt is concerning that many people oppose same-sex marriage due to the belief that homosexuality is a result of psychological trauma or a personality defect, as posited by some religious communities. This notion has been debunked by reputable institutions, such as the American Psychological Association, which has issued statements refuting these claims. It is crucial for society to rely on empirical evidence rather than popular opinions or cultural norms that perpetuate misconceptions and prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, the legalization of same-sex marriage is not only a matter of civil rights but also a recognition of the fundamental human desire for equality and dignified partnerships. The federal government should lead the way in ensuring that these rights are uniformly protected in every state, fostering a more inclusive and just society.",
            "In my summer employment at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a peculiar dichotomy. While certain drugs, deemed illicit, possess inherent benefits, their availability to the public can be a contentious issue. However, for medicinal purposes, I contend their usage should be considered. For instance, substances like oxycodone, vicodin, and percocets are controlled substances, yet they're often utilized due to their therapeutic benefits. Denying these benefits merely because of societal stigma is counterintuitive. I advocate for a gradual integration of marijuana into the legal framework, rather than a wholesale legalization, to mitigate potential abuse. The negative perception of marijuana, as an illegal drug, hinders its responsible utilization. I believe, by addressing this stigma, people can adopt a more nuanced understanding, potentially allowing for its medicinal use.",
            "Personally, I believe the church has evolved to meet the demands of the 21st century. The atmosphere is less stringent compared to the past. When I was young, Sundays at church were a routine, complete with cute dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. Back then, everyone was dressed up, including my friends from private school who joined me on weekends. Now, however, things have changed significantly. There's a youth service that's only thirty minutes, and attire is much more casual, especially during the summer with beach clothes being common. Families often arrive late, and even morning masses have seen a relaxation in dress code. Jeans and khakis are now acceptable, though khakis have their own charm. The church I'm familiar with is focused on this adaptation, but I'm unsure about the church's political or theological intricacies.\n\nRegarding allegations against Catholic priests and child abuse, I don't believe changes like female ordination or allowing priests to marry could have prevented these incidents. Men who are married and who are attracted to children aren't necessarily cured by marriage. The inclination seems to be rooted in genetics, not upbringing. While the church might have been aware and tried to cover it up in some cases, I think the primary factor is the individual's nature, which is unlikely to change through marriage.\n\nI don't have any further thoughts on the Catholic Church",
            "In the wake of the September 11th attacks, the initial reception of the Iraq War's rationale was accepting, yet the passage of time has shed light on the deeper motives and missteps. The Bush administration's connection of Saddam Hussein to the attacks and the assertion of weapons of mass destruction proved to be baseless, heightening my skepticism. The administration's dishonesty and disregard for the Constitution are evident, as former Secretary of State Colin Powell now admits to not being convinced by the presented evidence. This, to me, constitutes an impeachable offense. Furthermore, the younger Bush's personal vendetta against Saddam Hussein, stemming from his father's administration, and the ulterior motive of expanding energy supply, are clear. Despite the lengthy duration of the conflict, I believe immediate withdrawal could lead to a civil war and increased casualties. The proposed coalition of Syria and Saudi Arabia to restore order seems inadequate, as it could exacerbate the sovereignty issue and further complicate the political landscape. The interim government's ineffectiveness, with Prime Minister's waning control and radical elements vying for power, highlights the dire state of the political process.",
            "I've been struggling with the premise of the question. Let's begin by acknowledging that the conflict in Iraq is a complex issue. I must admit, I don't have a deep understanding of the specifics; it's not a topic I frequently engage with. At its core though, I believe the Iraq War was initiated based on the premise that Iraq was behind the September 11 attacks. However, I'm unconvinced that this initial reasoning holds up under scrutiny, as Iraq was never properly deemed a state of war by Congress. I'm not a fan of the War on Iraq, not because of any moral or ethical stance, but because I think it's a waste of resources and a futile effort to impose our political system on another country. I do not believe in the claim that the U.S. should be in the business of creating democracies abroad, especially when it results in our military being tied up in a region that's been plagued by conflict for decades. Furthermore, I believe that our continued presence in Iraq is merely to secure access to oil, which is a shortsighted and selfish goal. I'm not sure how to feel about the war ending or continuing; it's a complex situation. On one hand, I understand the desire to protect our troops and support them through their service. On the other hand, I can't ignore the fact that our presence is exacerbating the conflict and causing more harm than good. I don't have a clear solution, but I do believe that it's time for us to reevaluate our involvement in the region.",
            "The notion of legalizing or declaring it as legal by the state seems misguided, in my opinion. The constitution's principle of separation of church and state is quite explicit. I believe the decision should rest with the churches, not the government. Attempting to exert control over this matter would disregard the constitution's clear guidelines. It's akin to favoring one church's beliefs over others, as seen with the predominantly Catholic and Christian stance against it. The federal government should not interject, as this is more about personal religious views than a matter of public policy. Proposing an amendment solely based on personal beliefs would be contradictory to the constitution and potentially restrictive. The economy and society could even benefit from its legalization, though the specifics are unclear. I've expressed my viewpoint.",
            "The conflict in Iraq, it's a complex issue, and I believe there are aspects of it that the administration didn't fully disclose to the American public prior to the invasion. The invasion, which began in 2003, was portrayed as a response to the terrorist attacks of September 11th, yet the connection between the two events was tenuous at best. The government exploited the public's emotional response to the attacks to garner support for the war. Personally, I am opposed to war, especially when it involves preemptive strikes. The war in Iraq, in many ways, mirrors the Vietnam War. The government's focus on removing the Iraqi government and installing a democratic regime seems to be a replay of their strategy in Vietnam. The aftermath of such actions is often chaotic and unpredictable, and the U.S. government did not adequately plan for it. The U.S. has now been involved in Iraq for nearly three years, with numerous American lives lost, and the country is still grappling with instability. The transition to democracy is a lengthy process, and it's not as straightforward as the government made it seem. The U.S. should have been more prepared for the complexities of rebuilding a nation. The decision to invade Iraq was difficult, especially considering the high cost in American lives and the uncertain success of the mission. The issue of oil resources is a significant factor in U.S. foreign policy, and the search for weapons of mass destruction turned out to be unfounded. While I hope for a swift resolution, I don't foresee immediate peace in Iraq.",
            "I must confess, I'm an advocate for same-sex marriage. I have always held this belief and it's strengthened over time. I believe it's a deeply personal choice, not something that should be influenced by societal norms or political interference. It's been scientifically proven that sexual orientation can have biological roots, making it unfair to deny individuals rights they didn't choose.\n\nI've witnessed firsthand, in my own neighborhood, openly gay couples living their lives just like any other family. They walk their dogs, tend to their gardens, and are active members of the community. It's hardly something that requires government or political involvement.\n\nPresident Bush's attempt to define marriage according to his interpretation is, in my opinion, misguided and unnecessary. Marriage is a personal choice, not a political one. It should be a private matter, not a public spectacle. The media's tendency to sensationalize same-sex marriages is a clear indication of this.\n\nI've read numerous studies and articles suggesting that sexual orientation may be influenced by biological predispositions, not solely by upbringing. If a person is predisposed to be homosexual, it's akin to any other inherent trait, no more controllable than the color of one's eyes. Yet, we see a double standard when it comes to same-sex marriage.\n\nI'm not sure I can express it any clearer. Same-sex marriage should be a private, personal decision, not a national or political one. It's a basic right to choose who you want to spend your life with, regardless of gender.",
            "In the contemporary landscape of digital communication, it's crucial to recognize that anything posted online is inherently public. When one shares content on the internet, it becomes accessible to an extensive audience, including those who might interpret it in ways unintended. As a Resident Advisor, I've encountered this firsthand; the impact of internet statements can have far-reaching consequences. For instance, discussing sensitive topics like violence or potential threats is not advisable, as it can attract unwanted attention from concerned parties. It's essential to be mindful of the information shared online, as it can shape perceptions and indeed influence actions. In the case of a past incident at my school, information about a threat was brought to the school's attention, leading to a thorough investigation. While privacy concerns are valid, if dangers are implied, it's imperative for authorities to take these concerns seriously. However, it's also essential to differentiate between genuine threats and playful remarks, as some individuals may use social media to share jokes or conduct experiments without cause for alarm. In conclusion, while it's vital to respect privacy, sharing sensitive information online can lead to unintended consequences, necessitating caution and responsible use of digital platforms.",
            "It seems the conflict has been protracted far too long. Initially, the intent was commendable: to instill democracy in a nation that lacked a fair political system. However, I posit that our focus has shifted, and the original purpose has been diluted. It appears we may have become entangled in the endeavor for the sake of asserting our global supremacy, with considerations of personal interests potentially tainting the initial resolve.\n\nFurthermore, the protracted duration of the conflict is problematic. While the entrance into war was a clear assertion of our purpose, the sustained engagement suggests a deterioration of our original cause. It seems the war has become an end in itself, with an insistence on a decisive conclusion or victory clouding our judgment.\n\nI believe it is time to reevaluate our engagement. Continuing to pour resources into this conflict, while our own economy and social infrastructure languish, is unsustainable. We have ample domestic issues—poverty, infrastructure, healthcare—that demand our attention. It is high time we allow the local government to assume responsibility for its fate and redirect our allocation towards addressing our own pressing needs.",
            "Could you assist in clearing up a query regarding the circumstances that led to a specific prevention? On the internet, it seems that information is often accessible to a broad audience. For instance, on platforms such as Myspace, while certain profiles may require a member to view them, this implies a form of consent, as one would need to accept that person as a \"friend\" to access their profile. Posting information online essentially entails an understanding that a multitude of individuals may view it. The notion of someone intercepting and utilizing such data to prevent a life-threatening situation is intriguing. However, the practicality of having a single individual monitor all student profiles is impractical and could potentially lead to discriminatory practices. The situation could be complex, with profiles being accessed either randomly or intentionally for specific evidence. My own Facebook experience has taught me to be cautious about the personal data I share. It's a delicate balance between staying connected with friends and safeguarding my privacy. While I've accepted requests from those I know, it's unnerving to realize that strangers might have access to details about my daily routine and interests. My roommate shared that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace, which struck me as an odd restriction, as I'm unsure of how educational authorities could enforce such a policy. It's a nuanced issue with no clear-cut solution.",
            "In contemplation, I must address the Iraq War once more, a topic that I find myself hesitant to revisit. I was opposed to it initially, but its significance seems to have faded. The prevailing consensus, both domestically and abroad, regards it as a misguided venture. Polls from the United States, Iraq, and globally reveal a staggering eighty percent belief that the invasion was a mistake. Even a substantial portion of U.S. troops stationed there today suggest that withdrawal should commence within the year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq has been chaotic from the outset, with no clear path forward. The cultural chasm between the U.S. and Middle Eastern nations is immense, and attempts to impose Western ideals are met with resistance. Saddam Hussein's regime may have been reprehensible, but the consequences of invasion far outweigh potential benefits. It is akin to walking into a pit of quicksand.\n\nI struggle to find a compelling reason to prolong our involvement. The administration's justification for staying has yet to be substantiated. A phased withdrawal over a year or more might be plausible, but I question the urgency of an immediate departure. It appears that Iraqi citizens themselves, those we aim to help, desire our departure. Their counsel, if sought, could absolve us from responsibility if things deteriorate further. While we may never be viewed as benevolent in the Middle East, a swift exit would certainly alleviate our current predicament.",
            "Indeed, it is my conviction that gender discrimination remains a tangible issue in the United States. It is not merely confined to the female gender; rather, it extends across various professional domains. For instance, in industries where women are historically underrepresented, there exists a persistent bias. This is evidenced by the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women, though possessing the necessary qualifications, face barriers to advancement. This societal mindset, shaped by decades of tradition, often prevents women from reaching higher positions, despite their capabilities.\n\nMoreover, men also face discrimination in certain fields. For example, the fashion industry often regards male professionals with skepticism. This is due to the perception that men in fashion are not as well-versed in the female consumer perspective. Additionally, men who opt to stay at home to care for their children, despite their partners' higher earning potential, often encounter societal disapproval and scrutiny. Society frequently expects men to be the primary breadwinners, leading to a misconception that men not fulfilling this role are not contributing to their families.\n\nHowever, change is gradual. While women are increasingly occupying leadership roles and being accepted in the corporate world, these shifts have been slow. Similarly, the acceptance of men in non-traditional roles, such as stay-at-home dads, is also evolving. The fashion industry is beginning to recognize the value of male perspectives, particularly when informed by female relationships.\n\nDespite these improvements, discrimination based on both gender and regional backgrounds persists. For example, an individual from a rural background with excellent intelligence but subpar grammar may face skepticism in the workplace. This highlights the multifaceted nature of discrimination in the United States. While we have made significant strides since the 19th century, change remains a gradual process. It is essential to continue promoting diversity and inclusion incrementally, without forcing societal shifts too rapidly, to ensure sustainable progress.",
            "In my comprehension, the state has not legalized marijuana, but rather decriminalized it. This change in legal status means that possessing small amounts of marijuana is treated similarly to a traffic citation, rather than a criminal offense. This shift in policy aims to reduce the burden on the legal system, as it avoids the need for arrests, trials, and the appointment of public defenders. Consequently, it also reduces the financial strain on municipalities, allowing them to redirect resources towards more pressing needs, like education and social programs. However, it's important to note that while decriminalization can alleviate some of the societal burdens associated with marijuana use, it doesn't entirely eliminate potential future consequences, such as employment discrimination. Moreover, the widespread use of marijuana in public spaces remains a contentious issue, as it may be seen as inappropriate or unacceptable in certain contexts. Additionally, while both marijuana and alcohol can impair decision-making and motor skills, their effects vary greatly among individuals. Some people may be able to manage their use responsibly, while others may struggle with addiction or misuse. Ultimately, the impact of marijuana on a person's life depends on their personal characteristics and behavior.",
            "I must admit, the traditional practices within the Catholic Church, while rooted in history, can sometimes feel static and resistant to change. While it is commendable to maintain these long-standing customs, I believe it is equally essential to be adaptable and inclusive in our approach. Consider, for instance, the weekly church attendance expected of Catholics. This rigidity can sometimes seem exclusionary, particularly to those who don't adhere strictly to the doctrine. This strict adherence can extend to a lack of acceptance towards individuals from other faiths, such as my father, who was an Episcopalian, and his inability to wed my mother, a Catholic, within the Church. This stance, while traditional, can appear contradictory to the core teaching of loving others, regardless of their faith. I feel that the Church's practices often lag behind its principles, creating a disconnect between the two.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of priestly celibacy, while deeply ingrained, does not necessarily correlate with the prevalence of child molestation. Allowing priests to marry, I believe, would neither deter nor encourage such behavior. Pedophilia is a separate issue, unrelated to marital status. Thus, I do not see this as a viable solution to prevent such occurrences. In essence, the Church's refusal to adapt its practices to contemporary standards may sometimes hinder its ability to reach diverse communities, despite its well-intentioned teachings.",
            "I have yet to form a definitive opinion on this subject matter. Consequently, I find it challenging to assert that either side holds the correct perspective. However, I believe this issue to be particularly complex due to its proximity to the separation of church and state, and the difficulty in defining marriage without causing offense to any group. I am uncertain whether civil unions should be recognized by the government, akin to how religious ceremonies like baptism are not. If individuals are married, I believe they should be viewed as having entered into a civil union, as that is the most accurate description of their relationship. I do not envision the government inquiring into the nature of their union or its religious basis. In regards to gay marriage, I see it simply as two people entering into a civil union. If all states could reach a consensus on this matter, it should be made a federal law. However, amending the constitution to ban gay marriage seems overly dramatic. The constitution should not be amended for such a significant cause, as it would be too divisive. It is not important enough to warrant a constitutional amendment. Simply put, I do not support amending the constitution to ban gay marriage.",
            "Growing up in a household that adheres to Christian principles, my perspective on the topic of homosexuality is somewhat nuanced. I have several friends who identify as gay, and while I myself do not subscribe to their lifestyle, I firmly believe that it should be legalized. I believe this decision should be made at the state level rather than by the federal government.\n\nFor instance, many states are predominantly Democratic or Republican, which means they tend to lean towards a particular political stance. If you choose to live in a state that leans Democratic, for example, you are likely aware of its stance on issues like gay marriage. I believe that individuals should respect the choice of their state rather than attempting to argue against it.\n\nMoreover, I think it is crucial that homosexuals be given the same opportunities as heterosexuals. Therefore, I feel that the legalization of gay marriage should be left to the discretion of each state. I firmly believe that President Bush does not have the mandate to impose his views on the entire country. Instead, I believe that the decision should be left up to each individual state, as they are the ones who will ultimately be impacted by their own choice.\n\nIn two years, when Bush is no longer in office, a Democratic president may choose to lift the ban on gay marriage. This would simply lead to a political tug-of-war, with the decision constantly shifting. I believe it is far more practical to allow each state to make its own decision, as they are the ones who will truly live with the consequences.",
            "Um, I'd like to clarify a few points. Firstly, I don't believe in the notion that social media platforms like Myspace are inherently private. A bulletin board, by definition, is for public consumption. If one posts something on the internet, they must understand that it becomes publicly accessible, regardless of the platform. Consequently, school officials have a right to view this information, even if it's not under the school's name. They can access it from their personal devices, which they do at home. However, I see it differently when it comes to preventing school shootings. If accessing such information helps ensure student safety and safeguards the school environment, it's reasonable. This is the responsibility of the school system. Yet, I draw the line when officials actively use these platforms to catch students in misconduct. That, in my opinion, infringes on privacy. However, if the purpose is to enhance safety and security, it's acceptable. I've considered this with a teacher, and we discussed the need for such measures, especially after the Columbine incident. We practiced drills to maintain safety, similar to the school's role in preventing tragedies. Hence, I believe the officials were acting within their mandate to keep the school a safe haven for students.",
            "Initially, the events of September 11th deeply impacted me, fueling my desire for swift retribution. However, as time passed, I came to realize that our actions were rushed and ill-prepared. The emotional fervor that initially drove us to invade Iraq ultimately led to a complex situation that we were ill-equipped to handle. The lack of a clear plan and understanding of the cultural and political landscape proved detrimental. I now believe that our involvement has not only failed to achieve the desired results but has also exacerbated the situation. The inherent instability and factions within the region make it clear that our presence is not facilitating peace or progress. Instead, it keeps the focus on our presence rather than addressing the core issues. It is my firm belief that our intervention has been more harmful than helpful, and I advocate for a more strategic and nuanced approach. The complexities of the region and the nature of the conflict require a long-term strategy rather than a quick, emotional response.\n\nThe consequences of our actions are evident in the ongoing turmoil and lack of progress. The people of Iraq have their own battles to fight, and our presence does not seem to be aiding their self-determination. The initial impulse to act was understandable, but our actions have not been aligned with a rational, long-term vision. I now regret the lack of a cohesive plan and the emotional underpinnings of our initial response. The inherent divisions and chaos in the region suggest that our involvement has been counterproductive. It is crucial to reassess our strategy and consider the long-term implications of our actions. The people of Iraq need to find their own path to peace and stability, and our continued presence may be hindering that process. A more strategic and deliberate approach is necessary to address the underlying issues and facilitate genuine progress."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church requires reform. I have noted that its membership is declining, and I believe this is due to its sometimes stringent stance on various issues. For instance, its position on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as outdated or unyielding. While it's acceptable to have strong convictions, the Church's views on these topics may be alienating to some. I've heard that many people are withdrawing from the Church, disagreeing with their stances on these subjects. For example, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that opposes these beliefs. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married clergy, but I'm unsure if these changes would have prevented the recent issues. Perhaps the Church's dogmatic nature is more to blame. The Church claims its priests are married to God, but I see no reason why they can't also have personal relationships.",
            "I must preface this by saying that I'm not inherently against same-sex marriage. It's not a topic I've extensively examined, but I do have some thoughts on it. I believe that sexual orientation is not something that can be chosen, and thus, individuals should not be held accountable for their orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can marry, while two people of the same sex cannot. It just seems unfair and illogical to me. I think it's more of a personal choice than a societal one, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in it. It's not a security threat, and it's not something that should be disciplined. People should be able to live their lives as they choose, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't think it's the federal government's place to interfere with that.",
            "In regards to the normalization of same-sex unions, I firmly believe that the current legal landscape is not only outdated but also discriminatory. Fundamental arguments against it often hinge on the notion that such relationships pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family, yet this oversimplifies the complex nature of human relationships. Heterosexual and homosexual partnerships, despite their differences, share a multitude of commonalities that render them interchangeable in most practical aspects.\n\nFor instance, the civil and legal rights granted to married couples are extensive, encompassing property taxes and healthcare provisions, among others. The exclusion of same-sex couples from these benefits is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Furthermore, studies have shown that the success rates of homosexual unions are on par with those of their heterosexual counterparts, with similar factors contributing to relational satisfaction.\n\nThe primary contention often lies in the conflation of religious and secular realms. Advocates for same-sex marriage are not seeking religious sanction but rather a civil union recognized by the government. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, should be upheld and respected in this context.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of gay couples on the community and the potential influence on children are often overstated. Research indicates that children of gay parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples, with no significant differences in emotional or social development. The key determinant is not sexual orientation but rather the quality of parenting.\n\nUltimately, I argue for federal legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide. The current patchwork of state laws is inefficient and discriminatory. The federal government should take a leadership role in this matter, rather than leaving it to individual states to decide. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that any legislation must be informed by evidence-based research and not merely religious or cultural biases.\n\nPresident Bush's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in his religious beliefs, which is understandable. However, it is problematic when these beliefs are translated into public policy, particularly given the federal government's historical stance on religious neutrality. The recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance, for example, illustrates the sensitivity around religious symbols in public life.\n\nLastly, it is essential to dispel the misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. The notion that it is a result of psychological trauma or personality defects has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The American Psychological Association, among other authoritative institutions, has refuted such claims. It is imperative that public discourse on this topic is informed by empirical evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural biases.",
            "In the course of my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a recurring theme that often confounds me: the stigma surrounding certain substances. While it's true that the illegality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its lack of potential benefits, I must assert that my stance is nuanced. I affirm that while the public consumption of these substances should be restricted, their medicinal use should be considered.\n\nTo elucidate, consider the controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, which are widely used in medical settings despite their legality. These substances are not without their perils, but their benefits are undeniable. Marijuana, in my opinion, possesses similar potential. However, the public perception of marijuana as a harmful substance detracts from its responsible use.\n\nI propose a gradual legalization process, beginning with the elimination of the stigma associated with marijuana. This could be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. By doing so, I believe we can foster an environment where marijuana is used responsibly, both medically and recreationally.",
            "Well, over the years, the church has certainly evolved to better reflect the spirit of the twenty-first century. It's no longer as stringent as it once was. As a child, my Sundays were filled with church attendance, complete with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. I even attended a private school where many of my friends frequented the church on weekends. However, as I've grown older, the church has made notable adaptations. For instance, they've introduced a youth service that's only thirty minutes long, and the attire has become significantly more casual. Even in the morning masses, I now see people in jeans and khakis, a stark contrast to the more formal attire of the past. The church I know has indeed undergone these changes, but I'm not privy to the internal politics or the intricacies of its leadership. That's the extent of my observations.\n\nRegarding your questions about the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe that these incidents couldn't have been entirely prevented by the church simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. The root of the problem lies within the individual, not the institution. Some married individuals struggle with pedophilia, and their marital status doesn't alter their predispositions. If a person is predisposed to such behavior, they may seek it out regardless of marital status. The choice to become a priest is a personal one, and if someone feels called to the priesthood despite wanting to marry, they might consider a different faith that permits it, like Seventh Heaven, where ministers and reverends can marry.\n\nTo further clarify, I believe that sexual attraction, including pedophilia, is largely genetic. I don't think it's something that can be entirely influenced by upbringing or societal changes. Marriage, while it can provide a support system, doesn't change someone's genetic makeup. Therefore, I don't believe the church could have prevented these incidents through societal changes alone. If the church was aware of these cases and endeavored to cover them up, that would indeed be despicable, but I suspect that in many cases, the church may not have been aware of these incidents.",
            "In the wake of the September 11th events, I initially found the initial premise acceptable. However, I soon realized that the collective shock and grief made it easy for the Iraq War to be framed as a response to Osama Bin Laden and the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These claims were later debunked, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. The Bush administration's handling of the situation has always been a source of frustration for me, as the administration's lies about the justification for war have never been adequately addressed, even by those who were directly involved.\n\nI find it particularly galling that Colin Powell, who once presented the case for war with such conviction, now admits he was not persuaded by the evidence at the time. This, to me, is a clear example of malfeasance in office, approaching an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is not just an issue of the past; it has been ongoing since 9/11, with a clear intent to expand our energy supply and settle old scores, specifically with Saddam Hussein.\n\nWithdrawing from Iraq now could potentially lead to a civil war, with more lives lost. The proposed alternative—an intervention by neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also does not inspire confidence. The long-term stability of Iraq's sovereignty is uncertain, with the interim government's effectiveness questionable and radical elements vying for control.",
            "Hmm, let's see. What's this about? Oh, the war in Iraq. Okay. Well, it's like, I don't know much about it, really. It feels, I mean, it started as a response to something, right? Like, the attacks on September 11th. But now, I'm not sure it's making much sense. It's like, we're trying to build democracy there, which takes time, and we're doing it for our own interests too, like oil. It's just, it's not helping matters much. And if we stay, we'll be stuck there forever, trying to keep the peace, and if we leave, it'll be like we abandoned them. It's a tough situation. I don't know, it's hard to say if it's worth it. It's like, we're not at war with them, really. It's just a bunch of soldiers stationed there. It's like, we're showing off our power, but it's not a real war. And it shouldn't be called one. But, I don't know, I'm not sure if I should want it to end. It's just, it's complicated. It's like we're interfering in their culture and making things worse. It's like, we're trying to change them into something they're not. And it's going to end up causing more problems. I mean, there's so much going on there. It's like, it's a mess.

            "I’m hesitant to endorse the notion of making it legally binding or for a state to even recognize its legitimacy. I firmly believe that the decision should rest with the religious institutions, as the Constitution explicitly advocates for the separation of church and state. The guidelines are crystal clear, and any attempt to impose regulations or exert control over this issue would be a direct contradiction of the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Consequently, I maintain that the decision to legalize or ban this practice should not be imposed by the government but rather left to the discretion of religious bodies.\n\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that those advocating for its illegality are prioritizing one religious belief over others, as historical records indicate that the majority of Christians, particularly Catholics, are opposed to this practice. It is my perspective that the government should not impose its will on matters of faith and belief, as the Constitution promotes religious tolerance and freedom. Furthermore, I am skeptical about the proposed amendment, as I believe it would be a rare instance where the government seeks to restrict the people rather than itself.\n\nMy stance is that neither the federal government nor any other authority should intervene in this matter. The push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader societal or economic concerns. I do not foresee any significant impact on the economy or society as a result of this practice, and I believe that it could potentially have a positive effect on societal well-being. In essence, I maintain that the final decision should be left to the churches, and I do not see any compelling reasons to alter the current legal status through an amendment.",
            "In the realm of historical context, the war in Iraq is a topic that has long been a subject of scrutiny and debate. To commence, I firmly believe that the authorities did not provide the populace with a candid account of the reasons behind the decision to invade Iraq. The association drawn between the war and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's indignation to rally support for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI, myself, am staunchly opposed to military intervention, particularly when it involves preventive strikes. The conflict in Iraq, however, is a stark reminder of the Vietnam War's echoes. The American government's failure to adequately prepare for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued following the removal of the Iraqi government is a glaring oversight. The government's inability to anticipate the vacuum of power and the subsequent insurgency is a poignant lesson not learned from the past.\n\nThe efforts to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of similar attempts in Vietnam, have proven to be a lengthy and arduous process. The US government's portrayal of a swift, successful campaign was, in hindsight, naive. Building a functional democracy takes time, as our own history attests, and the government's optimism about the ease of this endeavor was misplaced.\n\nThe decision to engage in war is a complex one, and the 2004 presidential election was a pivotal moment in my political awakening. I found myself grappling with the decision to support George W. Bush's continuation of the Iraq occupation. The responsibility to honor the sacrifices made and the lives lost is a heavy one, but so too is the responsibility to weigh the cost in human lives against the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. The question of whether our intervention was motivated by altruism or strategic interests, particularly concerns over oil resources, is one that has fueled ongoing debate.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a reminder of the intricacies of foreign policy and the challenges of nation-building. Despite the best intentions, the ultimate outcome often depends on factors beyond our control. It is my sincere hope that the conflict will conclude soon, and that peace will prevail in the region, though I remain skeptical of such a swift resolution.",
            "I've always held the belief in the rightness of same-sex unions. It's a deeply personal choice, one that many now recognize as potentially having biological underpinnings rather than being solely influenced by societal norms. It seems inequitable to me that individuals might face reduced rights based on something largely beyond their control. I find it disheartening to think that people could be denied the same rights and opportunities due to their orientation. I've long been an advocate for full acceptance and equality in this regard.\n\nPolitics and government often interject themselves where they shouldn't. This is a matter of personal and household concern, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples, functioning just as any other family would, despite not being officially married due to legal restrictions. It's these everyday, ordinary examples that underscore the need for change.\n\nThe notion of interpreting the sacred institution of marriage through a political lens can be seen as an overreach. I've seen compelling evidence suggesting that sexual orientation might have biological roots, as opposed to being shaped solely by environment and upbringing. This perspective challenges the notion that such unions are any less valid or natural. It's akin to saying that individuals predisposed to heterosexuality should be denied marriage if they were raised in a single-parent household with multiple sisters, for instance.\n\nMoreover, the double standard seems glaring. Heterosexual couples can elope, marriage licenses aside, while same-sex couples often face public scrutiny and media attention. Marital choices, in my view, should be private affairs, not public spectacles.",
            "Posting something on the internet is akin to sharing it with the entire world. It's public, plain and simple. As a Resident Assistant, I've faced this issue firsthand. When you place something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you discuss volatile topics such as violence, you can't escape scrutiny. The internet, after all, is accessible to everyone. If a friend on Myspace sees something concerning, they might inform the school. They can't ignore such information, as they must prevent potential dangers. However, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes, people jest about such topics, and it might just be a misunderstanding. In our school, an incident occurred where someone misinterpreted a post as a threat. The person in question had intended it as a joke, but the situation escalated due to the context. It's essential to remember that the internet is a public space. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your posts. However, if school officials are made aware of a potential threat through legitimate means, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't, however, snoop through students' social media accounts under false pretenses. If a student brings it to their attention, it falls under a different category. In conclusion, while the internet is a public forum, it's crucial to be mindful of what you post and who you share it with.",
            "The conflict has stretched on interminably, and I find it hard to discern the original intent. Initially, it seemed the goal was to instill democratic principles in a nation, but over time, that objective appears to have been lost sight of. It seems we are now engaged in this endeavor more for the sake of global dominance than for any clear political purpose. I believe the initial motivations were questionable, possibly influenced by personal connections between the current and previous administrations. If the purpose was to introduce democracy into a system lacking it, that was a noble aim. However, if personal concerns played a part, then I question the fairness of the cause. I believe our objective was made clear within the first few months of the conflict, yet it has persisted for years.\n\nI maintain that the war's duration has reached a point where it is no longer serving its initial purpose. It feels as if we are engaged in this for the sake of engaging in it, and we are reluctant to end it without a clear victory. I believe it is time to reconsider our involvement, as the local government is now capable of managing its affairs independently. Moreover, our economy is bearing the brunt of this conflict, as we invest billions in a war while our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure, remain unaddressed. It seems our resources would be better spent on our own citizens' well-being rather than sustaining a war that has lost its focus. The immense financial investment in this conflict is a drain on our economy and should be redirected towards more pressing domestic needs.\n\nI believe it is time to reassess our involvement and prioritize our own internal projects and improvements.",
            "Regarding your recent inquiry, I'd like to pose a question to clarify the situation. It seems that a certain event was averted due to someone's online activity. Notably, on platforms like Myspace, one's information is publicly accessible, much like a storefront. To access someone's profile, one typically needs to be their \"friend,\" thereby granting permission for that person to view their profile. However, I acknowledge that sharing information online inherently invites scrutiny.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain how one would effectively monitor all students' online activities. While it's understandable that schools might want to ensure students' safety, it's crucial to consider the potential for bias and invasion. If a school were to assign someone to monitor profiles, it could potentially lead to targeted surveillance. This raises ethical concerns, as it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI, for one, maintain a Facebook account, though I'm conscious that it's a double-edged sword. There are certainly unsavory individuals who can exploit this information for nefarious purposes. A television program I watched highlighted a man who managed to find a girl's screen name and engage with her within minutes, ultimately arranging a meeting. Personally, I wouldn't meet someone I don't know, but I've had classmates who recognize me, despite not knowing my screen name. This raises concerns about privacy, as they can piece together information about my life.\n\nBalancing the benefits of social media with the risks is tricky. I only accept friend requests from acquaintances, but it's impossible to know who might be looking at one's profile. My roommate mentioned that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed quite restrictive. I question the school's authority to impose such a restriction.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns, I believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and safety.",
            "Indeed,\nI find myself compelled to discuss the Iraq War one more time, though I must admit, I hesitate as it's a topic that often feels insincere when addressed.\nYou see, I was opposed from the outset, yet it's wiser not to dwell on sentiments that no longer matter.\nIt's evident that the majority of the world, including the Iraqis themselves, view the war negatively, with upwards of eighty percent supporting a swift withdrawal.\nThe troops stationed there, too, share this sentiment, with a significant portion believing a departure within the year is necessary.\nThe situation is, and has been, a catastrophe from the moment we entered, and it's clear our presence has only exacerbated this.\nThe Middle East's cultural differences pose a formidable obstacle to our attempts to impose Western ideals.\nSaddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrant, but the cost of intervention was not justified, given the potential for chaos and instability.\nMy perspective is that we should exit immediately, and though I understand the administration may have reasons for extending our stay, I remain unconvinced.\nThe Iraqis themselves, who we claim to be helping, have expressed desires for our departure, and listening to them should be our priority.\nIf they request our withdrawal, it would remove us from the equation should the situation deteriorate further.\nAfter all, while we may never be seen as saviors in the region, at least we would have acted on the will of those we claim to support.",
            "It is evident that gender discrimination persists in the United States, albeit in various forms. While not exclusively targeting women, certain occupations may still harbor biases. For instance, the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women encounter barriers to advancement despite equal qualifications, remains a challenge. This is partly due to societal perceptions that women are less suited for upper-management roles.\n\nMoreover, roles that were historically male-dominated, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face societal disapproval. Conversely, men in fields like fashion may face skepticism due to societal perceptions of their gender and lifestyle. Change, though gradual, is underway as more women secure executive positions and gain acceptance in the business world. Similarly, the acceptance of male stay-at-home parents is growing.\n\nAddressing these issues involves promoting the unique qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than forcefully pushing for change. This approach respects the pace of societal evolution and acknowledges the progress already made. Additionally, barriers due to regional backgrounds and educational levels also exist. For instance, a CEO with a rural upbringing might face discrimination due to less-than-perfect grammar. These examples illustrate the complex nature of discrimination and the need for ongoing efforts to combat it.",
            "The understanding is that it hasn't been legalized, but rather, decriminalized. This shift reduces the severity of the offense from a criminal one to something more akin to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic ticket. For instance, instead of being arrested and processed through the legal system, individuals are simply cited. This change doesn't eliminate the potential future impacts, such as those on employment prospects, but it does reduce the immediate legal consequences and associated costs. The cost of law enforcement and court proceedings is substantial, particularly for financially struggling municipalities. Therefore, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana. However, in places like Denver, where the social and political climate is more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as a viable option. This can free up resources for community services, such as education, social programs for the elderly, and aid for the homeless. It's important to strike a balance; while marijuana should not be prevalent everywhere, its decriminalization can have financial benefits. However, it's crucial to consider the societal implications, such as the acceptability of openly smoking marijuana and the potential impact on driving safety. Both alcohol and marijuana can affect individuals differently, with each substance having its own set of potential negative effects. No two people react the same to substances, and personal moderation is key. Despite the differences in individual reactions, both substances have their own adverse effects. The general consensus is that they both should be approached with caution.",
            "I would lean towards affirming the notion\nGiven that\nMany of their practices are steeped in tradition\nThus, they've maintained the same rituals over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to remain anchored in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to be flexible to change\nIndeed\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly attendance at Mass\nAnd\nThey're stringent about maintaining certain protocols\nAdditionally\nThere's a perception that the Catholic Church exhibits a certain attitude towards those who deviate from the doctrine\nEven\nIt seems that they're not receptive to individuals who aren't fully aligned with the Catholic faith\nMoreover\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith union was declined by the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian background\nClearly\nThis isn't a demonstration of tolerance towards other religions\nDespite being taught to love others, the Catholic Church's practice often contradicts this principle\nIn essence, the doctrine instructs one to love and accept all, yet the Church's behavior suggests otherwise\nIt's as if the Church is wedded to outdated practices which they continue to uphold\n\nI don't believe this situation would significantly impact the issue\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to marry might be a positive step\nBut\nI don't anticipate it would prevent pedophilic behavior\nAs\nIt lies in a different sphere\nMoreover\nIndividuals who commit such acts would likely continue to do so irrespective of their marital status\nSince the target isn't a spouse but a child\nIt appears that such acts would transpire regardless of marriage status\nTherefore, I don't think permitting priests to marry would mitigate these issues",
            "I'm still deliberating on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I must admit, I'm torn. On one hand, it's a highly sensitive topic, balancing on the precipice of church and state. Defining marriage, especially when it comes to same-sex unions, is a thorny endeavor, as it involves navigating complex social and legal landscapes.\n\nI believe that, in terms of government recognition, civil unions are the way to go. If two people choose to unite, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or cultural context? After all, people who are baptized or belong to certain religions don't receive special government treatment based on that alone. Therefore, I think the government should approach the matter with a neutral stance, recognizing the union for what it is.\n\nIf all states can agree on a logical course of action, then I believe a federal law should be implemented. However, I firmly believe that amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach. This would be a disproportionate response to a complex social issue. It's not that I don't believe in the importance of the issue, but I don't believe it's significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't support amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It's not the right approach to address this matter.",
            "Growing up in a religious household, the subject of homosexuality has been a complex and intriguing topic for me. While I have a plethora of friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I must admit that I have reservations about their lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the legalization of same-sex relations and advocate for a state-by-state decision process rather than a federal one. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its stance on the matter, as policies should reflect the values and beliefs of the people who live there. Furthermore, I find it problematic when a national figure, such as the president, attempts to impose their views on the entire country. After all, they do not reside in every state, and their policies should not supersede the collective will of the people living in their respective communities. Therefore, I stand in favor of leaving these decisions in the hands of the individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately bear the consequences of their choices.",
            "Well, to begin with, I don't think it's accurate to assert that MySpace is a private platform. According to the definition, it's a bulletin board meant for public consumption. When we put something online, we should expect various individuals, including educators, to view it. It's a public sphere, and while I understand the concern about privacy, if the information is accessible to the public, it's not a violation per se. However, if the intent is purely to monitor students' activities to maintain a safer environment, that's a different story.\n\nConsider, for instance, if a student posts about their involvement in harmful activities. If the school officials witness this and it aids in preventing a tragedy, like a school shooting, can we really call that an invasion of privacy? It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's acceptable to use public platforms for this purpose when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of students.\n\nI must admit, I've often hesitated to express myself freely online, even through electronic communication. I'm not particularly eager to share anything that could potentially be used against me later. The digital trail we leave behind can come back to haunt us. I've had experiences where I've refrained from sharing even mundane facts about others due to fear of misinterpretation. It's a constant vigilance, and I believe it's a prudent practice, especially for students who might not understand the full implications of their online actions.\n\nBut, returning to the topic at hand, if the information accessed is used to enhance the safety of the school environment, it's not an invasion. It's more about the integrity and responsibility of the school system to ensure a safe space for its students. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe and secure environment when they entrust them to the system.\n\nFurthermore, schools have been proactive in preparing for various threats, including school shootings. Lockdown drills, security protocols, and surveillance are all measures taken to safeguard students. In this context, if school officials are using available information to maintain this safe environment, I wouldn't consider it an invasion of privacy. Instead, it's a responsibility they've undertaken to ensure the well-being of their students.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I understand the concern about privacy, I believe the balance tips towards the responsibility and the necessity of the school system to ensure the safety of its students, especially in the context of a potentially dangerous situation like a school shooting.",
            "In the aftermath of the devastating events of September 11th, I was initially swayed by a strong desire for retribution. The sentiment was understandable, as the attacks hit close to home. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea of invading and causing as much upheaval as the terrorists had done here. However, with hindsight, it's clear that we overlooked many critical factors and acted impulsively, without a well-thought-out plan. The decision to go to war was emotionally driven and lacked a clear strategy. We entered the conflict underprepared, unaware of what we would face and the unique nature of warfare in that region. The mindset was largely one of vengeance, rather than rational consideration of long-term consequences or cultural differences.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, to some extent, a response to public sentiment. However, it appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a carefully considered policy. The lack of a clear plan for what to do once in Iraq only exacerbated the situation. The absence of a cohesive strategy and unity of purpose among our forces made it challenging to establish order. It is my belief that we were more driven by anger and revenge than by a genuine desire to improve the lives of the people in Iraq.\n\nMoreover, I have come to question the effectiveness of our involvement in the region. The constant conflict has been more harmful than helpful. The people of Iraq seem to be more focused on their internal struggles than on improving their country, and our presence there has not significantly altered this dynamic. I believe that our continued engagement in the area is more likely to exacerbate the problems than to resolve them. Ultimately, I feel that we should step back and allow the region to find its own path, rather than attempting to impose our will from the outside.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice was understandable, the execution of our military efforts was flawed. We acted impulsively and failed to consider the long-term implications and cultural differences. The ongoing conflict has not produced the desired results, and I believe that our withdrawal is the best course of action."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church requires reform. I have noted that its membership is declining, and I believe this is due to its sometimes stringent stance on various issues. For instance, its position on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as outdated or unyielding. While it's acceptable to have strong convictions, the Church's views on these topics may be alienating to some. I've heard that many people are withdrawing from the Church, disagreeing with their stances on these subjects. For example, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that opposes these beliefs. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married clergy, but I'm unsure if these changes would have prevented the recent issues. Perhaps the Church's dogmatic nature is more to blame. The Church claims its priests are married to God, but I see no reason why they can't also have personal relationships.",
            "I must preface this by saying that I'm not inherently against same-sex marriage. It's not a topic I've extensively examined, but I do have some thoughts on it. I believe that sexual orientation is not something that can be chosen, and thus, individuals should not be held accountable for their orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can marry, while two people of the same sex cannot. It just seems unfair and illogical to me. I think it's more of a personal choice than a societal one, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in it. It's not a security threat, and it's not something that should be disciplined. People should be able to live their lives as they choose, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't think it's the federal government's place to interfere with that.",
            "In regards to the normalization of same-sex unions, I firmly believe that the current legal landscape is not only outdated but also discriminatory. Fundamental arguments against it often hinge on the notion that such relationships pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family, yet this oversimplifies the complex nature of human relationships. Heterosexual and homosexual partnerships, despite their differences, share a multitude of commonalities that render them interchangeable in most practical aspects.\n\nFor instance, the civil and legal rights granted to married couples are extensive, encompassing property taxes and healthcare provisions, among others. The exclusion of same-sex couples from these benefits is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Furthermore, studies have shown that the success rates of homosexual unions are on par with those of their heterosexual counterparts, with similar factors contributing to relational satisfaction.\n\nThe primary contention often lies in the conflation of religious and secular realms. Advocates for same-sex marriage are not seeking religious sanction but rather a civil union recognized by the government. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, should be upheld and respected in this context.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of gay couples on the community and the potential influence on children are often overstated. Research indicates that children of gay parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples, with no significant differences in emotional or social development. The key determinant is not sexual orientation but rather the quality of parenting.\n\nUltimately, I argue for federal legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide. The current patchwork of state laws is inefficient and discriminatory. The federal government should take a leadership role in this matter, rather than leaving it to individual states to decide. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that any legislation must be informed by evidence-based research and not merely religious or cultural biases.\n\nPresident Bush's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in his religious beliefs, which is understandable. However, it is problematic when these beliefs are translated into public policy, particularly given the federal government's historical stance on religious neutrality. The recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance, for example, illustrates the sensitivity around religious symbols in public life.\n\nLastly, it is essential to dispel the misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. The notion that it is a result of psychological trauma or personality defects has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The American Psychological Association, among other authoritative institutions, has refuted such claims. It is imperative that public discourse on this topic is informed by empirical evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural biases.",
            "In the course of my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a recurring theme that often confounds me: the stigma surrounding certain substances. While it's true that the illegality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its lack of potential benefits, I must assert that my stance is nuanced. I affirm that while the public consumption of these substances should be restricted, their medicinal use should be considered.\n\nTo elucidate, consider the controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, which are widely used in medical settings despite their legality. These substances are not without their perils, but their benefits are undeniable. Marijuana, in my opinion, possesses similar potential. However, the public perception of marijuana as a harmful substance detracts from its responsible use.\n\nI propose a gradual legalization process, beginning with the elimination of the stigma associated with marijuana. This could be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. By doing so, I believe we can foster an environment where marijuana is used responsibly, both medically and recreationally.",
            "Well, over the years, the church has certainly evolved to better reflect the spirit of the twenty-first century. It's no longer as stringent as it once was. As a child, my Sundays were filled with church attendance, complete with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. I even attended a private school where many of my friends frequented the church on weekends. However, as I've grown older, the church has made notable adaptations. For instance, they've introduced a youth service that's only thirty minutes long, and the attire has become significantly more casual. Even in the morning masses, I now see people in jeans and khakis, a stark contrast to the more formal attire of the past. The church I know has indeed undergone these changes, but I'm not privy to the internal politics or the intricacies of its leadership. That's the extent of my observations.\n\nRegarding your questions about the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe that these incidents couldn't have been entirely prevented by the church simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. The root of the problem lies within the individual, not the institution. Some married individuals struggle with pedophilia, and their marital status doesn't alter their predispositions. If a person is predisposed to such behavior, they may seek it out regardless of marital status. The choice to become a priest is a personal one, and if someone feels called to the priesthood despite wanting to marry, they might consider a different faith that permits it, like Seventh Heaven, where ministers and reverends can marry.\n\nTo further clarify, I believe that sexual attraction, including pedophilia, is largely genetic. I don't think it's something that can be entirely influenced by upbringing or societal changes. Marriage, while it can provide a support system, doesn't change someone's genetic makeup. Therefore, I don't believe the church could have prevented these incidents through societal changes alone. If the church was aware of these cases and endeavored to cover them up, that would indeed be despicable, but I suspect that in many cases, the church may not have been aware of these incidents.",
            "In the wake of the September 11th events, I initially found the initial premise acceptable. However, I soon realized that the collective shock and grief made it easy for the Iraq War to be framed as a response to Osama Bin Laden and the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These claims were later debunked, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. The Bush administration's handling of the situation has always been a source of frustration for me, as the administration's lies about the justification for war have never been adequately addressed, even by those who were directly involved.\n\nI find it particularly galling that Colin Powell, who once presented the case for war with such conviction, now admits he was not persuaded by the evidence at the time. This, to me, is a clear example of malfeasance in office, approaching an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is not just an issue of the past; it has been ongoing since 9/11, with a clear intent to expand our energy supply and settle old scores, specifically with Saddam Hussein.\n\nWithdrawing from Iraq now could potentially lead to a civil war, with more lives lost. The proposed alternative—an intervention by neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also does not inspire confidence. The long-term stability of Iraq's sovereignty is uncertain, with the interim government's effectiveness questionable and radical elements vying for control.",
            "Hmm, let's see. What's this about? Oh, the war in Iraq. Okay. Well, it's like, I don't know much about it, really. It feels, I mean, it started as a response to something, right? Like, the attacks on September 11th. But now, I'm not sure it's making much sense. It's like, we're trying to build democracy there, which takes time, and we're doing it for our own interests too, like oil. It's just, it's not helping matters much. And if we stay, we'll be stuck there forever, trying to keep the peace, and if we leave, it'll be like we abandoned them. It's a tough situation. I don't know, it's hard to say if it's worth it. It's like, we're not at war with them, really. It's just a bunch of soldiers stationed there. It's like, we're showing off our power, but it's not a real war. And it shouldn't be called one. But, I don't know, I'm not sure if I should want it to end. It's just, it's complicated. It's like we're interfering in their culture and making things worse. It's like, we're trying to change them into something they're not. And it's going to end up causing more problems. I mean, there's so much going on there. It's like, it's a mess.

            "I’m hesitant to endorse the notion of making it legally binding or for a state to even recognize its legitimacy. I firmly believe that the decision should rest with the religious institutions, as the Constitution explicitly advocates for the separation of church and state. The guidelines are crystal clear, and any attempt to impose regulations or exert control over this issue would be a direct contradiction of the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Consequently, I maintain that the decision to legalize or ban this practice should not be imposed by the government but rather left to the discretion of religious bodies.\n\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that those advocating for its illegality are prioritizing one religious belief over others, as historical records indicate that the majority of Christians, particularly Catholics, are opposed to this practice. It is my perspective that the government should not impose its will on matters of faith and belief, as the Constitution promotes religious tolerance and freedom. Furthermore, I am skeptical about the proposed amendment, as I believe it would be a rare instance where the government seeks to restrict the people rather than itself.\n\nMy stance is that neither the federal government nor any other authority should intervene in this matter. The push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader societal or economic concerns. I do not foresee any significant impact on the economy or society as a result of this practice, and I believe that it could potentially have a positive effect on societal well-being. In essence, I maintain that the final decision should be left to the churches, and I do not see any compelling reasons to alter the current legal status through an amendment.",
            "In the realm of historical context, the war in Iraq is a topic that has long been a subject of scrutiny and debate. To commence, I firmly believe that the authorities did not provide the populace with a candid account of the reasons behind the decision to invade Iraq. The association drawn between the war and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's indignation to rally support for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI, myself, am staunchly opposed to military intervention, particularly when it involves preventive strikes. The conflict in Iraq, however, is a stark reminder of the Vietnam War's echoes. The American government's failure to adequately prepare for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued following the removal of the Iraqi government is a glaring oversight. The government's inability to anticipate the vacuum of power and the subsequent insurgency is a poignant lesson not learned from the past.\n\nThe efforts to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of similar attempts in Vietnam, have proven to be a lengthy and arduous process. The US government's portrayal of a swift, successful campaign was, in hindsight, naive. Building a functional democracy takes time, as our own history attests, and the government's optimism about the ease of this endeavor was misplaced.\n\nThe decision to engage in war is a complex one, and the 2004 presidential election was a pivotal moment in my political awakening. I found myself grappling with the decision to support George W. Bush's continuation of the Iraq occupation. The responsibility to honor the sacrifices made and the lives lost is a heavy one, but so too is the responsibility to weigh the cost in human lives against the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. The question of whether our intervention was motivated by altruism or strategic interests, particularly concerns over oil resources, is one that has fueled ongoing debate.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a reminder of the intricacies of foreign policy and the challenges of nation-building. Despite the best intentions, the ultimate outcome often depends on factors beyond our control. It is my sincere hope that the conflict will conclude soon, and that peace will prevail in the region, though I remain skeptical of such a swift resolution.",
            "I've always held the belief in the rightness of same-sex unions. It's a deeply personal choice, one that many now recognize as potentially having biological underpinnings rather than being solely influenced by societal norms. It seems inequitable to me that individuals might face reduced rights based on something largely beyond their control. I find it disheartening to think that people could be denied the same rights and opportunities due to their orientation. I've long been an advocate for full acceptance and equality in this regard.\n\nPolitics and government often interject themselves where they shouldn't. This is a matter of personal and household concern, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples, functioning just as any other family would, despite not being officially married due to legal restrictions. It's these everyday, ordinary examples that underscore the need for change.\n\nThe notion of interpreting the sacred institution of marriage through a political lens can be seen as an overreach. I've seen compelling evidence suggesting that sexual orientation might have biological roots, as opposed to being shaped solely by environment and upbringing. This perspective challenges the notion that such unions are any less valid or natural. It's akin to saying that individuals predisposed to heterosexuality should be denied marriage if they were raised in a single-parent household with multiple sisters, for instance.\n\nMoreover, the double standard seems glaring. Heterosexual couples can elope, marriage licenses aside, while same-sex couples often face public scrutiny and media attention. Marital choices, in my view, should be private affairs, not public spectacles.",
            "Posting something on the internet is akin to sharing it with the entire world. It's public, plain and simple. As a Resident Assistant, I've faced this issue firsthand. When you place something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you discuss volatile topics such as violence, you can't escape scrutiny. The internet, after all, is accessible to everyone. If a friend on Myspace sees something concerning, they might inform the school. They can't ignore such information, as they must prevent potential dangers. However, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes, people jest about such topics, and it might just be a misunderstanding. In our school, an incident occurred where someone misinterpreted a post as a threat. The person in question had intended it as a joke, but the situation escalated due to the context. It's essential to remember that the internet is a public space. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your posts. However, if school officials are made aware of a potential threat through legitimate means, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't, however, snoop through students' social media accounts under false pretenses. If a student brings it to their attention, it falls under a different category. In conclusion, while the internet is a public forum, it's crucial to be mindful of what you post and who you share it with.",
            "The conflict has stretched on interminably, and I find it hard to discern the original intent. Initially, it seemed the goal was to instill democratic principles in a nation, but over time, that objective appears to have been lost sight of. It seems we are now engaged in this endeavor more for the sake of global dominance than for any clear political purpose. I believe the initial motivations were questionable, possibly influenced by personal connections between the current and previous administrations. If the purpose was to introduce democracy into a system lacking it, that was a noble aim. However, if personal concerns played a part, then I question the fairness of the cause. I believe our objective was made clear within the first few months of the conflict, yet it has persisted for years.\n\nI maintain that the war's duration has reached a point where it is no longer serving its initial purpose. It feels as if we are engaged in this for the sake of engaging in it, and we are reluctant to end it without a clear victory. I believe it is time to reconsider our involvement, as the local government is now capable of managing its affairs independently. Moreover, our economy is bearing the brunt of this conflict, as we invest billions in a war while our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure, remain unaddressed. It seems our resources would be better spent on our own citizens' well-being rather than sustaining a war that has lost its focus. The immense financial investment in this conflict is a drain on our economy and should be redirected towards more pressing domestic needs.\n\nI believe it is time to reassess our involvement and prioritize our own internal projects and improvements.",
            "Regarding your recent inquiry, I'd like to pose a question to clarify the situation. It seems that a certain event was averted due to someone's online activity. Notably, on platforms like Myspace, one's information is publicly accessible, much like a storefront. To access someone's profile, one typically needs to be their \"friend,\" thereby granting permission for that person to view their profile. However, I acknowledge that sharing information online inherently invites scrutiny.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain how one would effectively monitor all students' online activities. While it's understandable that schools might want to ensure students' safety, it's crucial to consider the potential for bias and invasion. If a school were to assign someone to monitor profiles, it could potentially lead to targeted surveillance. This raises ethical concerns, as it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI, for one, maintain a Facebook account, though I'm conscious that it's a double-edged sword. There are certainly unsavory individuals who can exploit this information for nefarious purposes. A television program I watched highlighted a man who managed to find a girl's screen name and engage with her within minutes, ultimately arranging a meeting. Personally, I wouldn't meet someone I don't know, but I've had classmates who recognize me, despite not knowing my screen name. This raises concerns about privacy, as they can piece together information about my life.\n\nBalancing the benefits of social media with the risks is tricky. I only accept friend requests from acquaintances, but it's impossible to know who might be looking at one's profile. My roommate mentioned that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed quite restrictive. I question the school's authority to impose such a restriction.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns, I believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and safety.",
            "Indeed,\nI find myself compelled to discuss the Iraq War one more time, though I must admit, I hesitate as it's a topic that often feels insincere when addressed.\nYou see, I was opposed from the outset, yet it's wiser not to dwell on sentiments that no longer matter.\nIt's evident that the majority of the world, including the Iraqis themselves, view the war negatively, with upwards of eighty percent supporting a swift withdrawal.\nThe troops stationed there, too, share this sentiment, with a significant portion believing a departure within the year is necessary.\nThe situation is, and has been, a catastrophe from the moment we entered, and it's clear our presence has only exacerbated this.\nThe Middle East's cultural differences pose a formidable obstacle to our attempts to impose Western ideals.\nSaddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrant, but the cost of intervention was not justified, given the potential for chaos and instability.\nMy perspective is that we should exit immediately, and though I understand the administration may have reasons for extending our stay, I remain unconvinced.\nThe Iraqis themselves, who we claim to be helping, have expressed desires for our departure, and listening to them should be our priority.\nIf they request our withdrawal, it would remove us from the equation should the situation deteriorate further.\nAfter all, while we may never be seen as saviors in the region, at least we would have acted on the will of those we claim to support.",
            "It is evident that gender discrimination persists in the United States, albeit in various forms. While not exclusively targeting women, certain occupations may still harbor biases. For instance, the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women encounter barriers to advancement despite equal qualifications, remains a challenge. This is partly due to societal perceptions that women are less suited for upper-management roles.\n\nMoreover, roles that were historically male-dominated, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face societal disapproval. Conversely, men in fields like fashion may face skepticism due to societal perceptions of their gender and lifestyle. Change, though gradual, is underway as more women secure executive positions and gain acceptance in the business world. Similarly, the acceptance of male stay-at-home parents is growing.\n\nAddressing these issues involves promoting the unique qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than forcefully pushing for change. This approach respects the pace of societal evolution and acknowledges the progress already made. Additionally, barriers due to regional backgrounds and educational levels also exist. For instance, a CEO with a rural upbringing might face discrimination due to less-than-perfect grammar. These examples illustrate the complex nature of discrimination and the need for ongoing efforts to combat it.",
            "The understanding is that it hasn't been legalized, but rather, decriminalized. This shift reduces the severity of the offense from a criminal one to something more akin to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic ticket. For instance, instead of being arrested and processed through the legal system, individuals are simply cited. This change doesn't eliminate the potential future impacts, such as those on employment prospects, but it does reduce the immediate legal consequences and associated costs. The cost of law enforcement and court proceedings is substantial, particularly for financially struggling municipalities. Therefore, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana. However, in places like Denver, where the social and political climate is more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as a viable option. This can free up resources for community services, such as education, social programs for the elderly, and aid for the homeless. It's important to strike a balance; while marijuana should not be prevalent everywhere, its decriminalization can have financial benefits. However, it's crucial to consider the societal implications, such as the acceptability of openly smoking marijuana and the potential impact on driving safety. Both alcohol and marijuana can affect individuals differently, with each substance having its own set of potential negative effects. No two people react the same to substances, and personal moderation is key. Despite the differences in individual reactions, both substances have their own adverse effects. The general consensus is that they both should be approached with caution.",
            "I would lean towards affirming the notion\nGiven that\nMany of their practices are steeped in tradition\nThus, they've maintained the same rituals over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to remain anchored in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to be flexible to change\nIndeed\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly attendance at Mass\nAnd\nThey're stringent about maintaining certain protocols\nAdditionally\nThere's a perception that the Catholic Church exhibits a certain attitude towards those who deviate from the doctrine\nEven\nIt seems that they're not receptive to individuals who aren't fully aligned with the Catholic faith\nMoreover\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith union was declined by the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian background\nClearly\nThis isn't a demonstration of tolerance towards other religions\nDespite being taught to love others, the Catholic Church's practice often contradicts this principle\nIn essence, the doctrine instructs one to love and accept all, yet the Church's behavior suggests otherwise\nIt's as if the Church is wedded to outdated practices which they continue to uphold\n\nI don't believe this situation would significantly impact the issue\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to marry might be a positive step\nBut\nI don't anticipate it would prevent pedophilic behavior\nAs\nIt lies in a different sphere\nMoreover\nIndividuals who commit such acts would likely continue to do so irrespective of their marital status\nSince the target isn't a spouse but a child\nIt appears that such acts would transpire regardless of marriage status\nTherefore, I don't think permitting priests to marry would mitigate these issues",
            "I'm still deliberating on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I must admit, I'm torn. On one hand, it's a highly sensitive topic, balancing on the precipice of church and state. Defining marriage, especially when it comes to same-sex unions, is a thorny endeavor, as it involves navigating complex social and legal landscapes.\n\nI believe that, in terms of government recognition, civil unions are the way to go. If two people choose to unite, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or cultural context? After all, people who are baptized or belong to certain religions don't receive special government treatment based on that alone. Therefore, I think the government should approach the matter with a neutral stance, recognizing the union for what it is.\n\nIf all states can agree on a logical course of action, then I believe a federal law should be implemented. However, I firmly believe that amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach. This would be a disproportionate response to a complex social issue. It's not that I don't believe in the importance of the issue, but I don't believe it's significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't support amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It's not the right approach to address this matter.",
            "Growing up in a religious household, the subject of homosexuality has been a complex and intriguing topic for me. While I have a plethora of friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I must admit that I have reservations about their lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the legalization of same-sex relations and advocate for a state-by-state decision process rather than a federal one. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its stance on the matter, as policies should reflect the values and beliefs of the people who live there. Furthermore, I find it problematic when a national figure, such as the president, attempts to impose their views on the entire country. After all, they do not reside in every state, and their policies should not supersede the collective will of the people living in their respective communities. Therefore, I stand in favor of leaving these decisions in the hands of the individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately bear the consequences of their choices.",
            "Well, to begin with, I don't think it's accurate to assert that MySpace is a private platform. According to the definition, it's a bulletin board meant for public consumption. When we put something online, we should expect various individuals, including educators, to view it. It's a public sphere, and while I understand the concern about privacy, if the information is accessible to the public, it's not a violation per se. However, if the intent is purely to monitor students' activities to maintain a safer environment, that's a different story.\n\nConsider, for instance, if a student posts about their involvement in harmful activities. If the school officials witness this and it aids in preventing a tragedy, like a school shooting, can we really call that an invasion of privacy? It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's acceptable to use public platforms for this purpose when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of students.\n\nI must admit, I've often hesitated to express myself freely online, even through electronic communication. I'm not particularly eager to share anything that could potentially be used against me later. The digital trail we leave behind can come back to haunt us. I've had experiences where I've refrained from sharing even mundane facts about others due to fear of misinterpretation. It's a constant vigilance, and I believe it's a prudent practice, especially for students who might not understand the full implications of their online actions.\n\nBut, returning to the topic at hand, if the information accessed is used to enhance the safety of the school environment, it's not an invasion. It's more about the integrity and responsibility of the school system to ensure a safe space for its students. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe and secure environment when they entrust them to the system.\n\nFurthermore, schools have been proactive in preparing for various threats, including school shootings. Lockdown drills, security protocols, and surveillance are all measures taken to safeguard students. In this context, if school officials are using available information to maintain this safe environment, I wouldn't consider it an invasion of privacy. Instead, it's a responsibility they've undertaken to ensure the well-being of their students.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I understand the concern about privacy, I believe the balance tips towards the responsibility and the necessity of the school system to ensure the safety of its students, especially in the context of a potentially dangerous situation like a school shooting.",
            "In the aftermath of the devastating events of September 11th, I was initially swayed by a strong desire for retribution. The sentiment was understandable, as the attacks hit close to home. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea of invading and causing as much upheaval as the terrorists had done here. However, with hindsight, it's clear that we overlooked many critical factors and acted impulsively, without a well-thought-out plan. The decision to go to war was emotionally driven and lacked a clear strategy. We entered the conflict underprepared, unaware of what we would face and the unique nature of warfare in that region. The mindset was largely one of vengeance, rather than rational consideration of long-term consequences or cultural differences.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, to some extent, a response to public sentiment. However, it appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a carefully considered policy. The lack of a clear plan for what to do once in Iraq only exacerbated the situation. The absence of a cohesive strategy and unity of purpose among our forces made it challenging to establish order. It is my belief that we were more driven by anger and revenge than by a genuine desire to improve the lives of the people in Iraq.\n\nMoreover, I have come to question the effectiveness of our involvement in the region. The constant conflict has been more harmful than helpful. The people of Iraq seem to be more focused on their internal struggles than on improving their country, and our presence there has not significantly altered this dynamic. I believe that our continued engagement in the area is more likely to exacerbate the problems than to resolve them. Ultimately, I feel that we should step back and allow the region to find its own path, rather than attempting to impose our will from the outside.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice was understandable, the execution of our military efforts was flawed. We acted impulsively and failed to consider the long-term implications and cultural differences. The ongoing conflict has not produced the desired results, and I believe that our withdrawal is the best course of action."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "In several respects, the Catholic Church requires reform. I have noted that its membership is declining, and I believe this is due to its sometimes stringent stance on various issues. For instance, its position on same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control can be seen as outdated or unyielding. While it's acceptable to have strong convictions, the Church's views on these topics may be alienating to some. I've heard that many people are withdrawing from the Church, disagreeing with their stances on these subjects. For example, if one supports abortion or same-sex marriage, they might feel uncomfortable being part of a community that opposes these beliefs. I don't see any reason why the Church can't allow female priests or married clergy, but I'm unsure if these changes would have prevented the recent issues. Perhaps the Church's dogmatic nature is more to blame. The Church claims its priests are married to God, but I see no reason why they can't also have personal relationships.",
            "I must preface this by saying that I'm not inherently against same-sex marriage. It's not a topic I've extensively examined, but I do have some thoughts on it. I believe that sexual orientation is not something that can be chosen, and thus, individuals should not be held accountable for their orientation. I don't think it's right to say that a man and a woman can marry, while two people of the same sex cannot. It just seems unfair and illogical to me. I think it's more of a personal choice than a societal one, and I don't believe the federal government should be involved in it. It's not a security threat, and it's not something that should be disciplined. People should be able to live their lives as they choose, as long as it doesn't harm anyone else. I don't think it's the federal government's place to interfere with that.",
            "In regards to the normalization of same-sex unions, I firmly believe that the current legal landscape is not only outdated but also discriminatory. Fundamental arguments against it often hinge on the notion that such relationships pose a threat to the traditional nuclear family, yet this oversimplifies the complex nature of human relationships. Heterosexual and homosexual partnerships, despite their differences, share a multitude of commonalities that render them interchangeable in most practical aspects.\n\nFor instance, the civil and legal rights granted to married couples are extensive, encompassing property taxes and healthcare provisions, among others. The exclusion of same-sex couples from these benefits is not only unjust but also counterproductive. Furthermore, studies have shown that the success rates of homosexual unions are on par with those of their heterosexual counterparts, with similar factors contributing to relational satisfaction.\n\nThe primary contention often lies in the conflation of religious and secular realms. Advocates for same-sex marriage are not seeking religious sanction but rather a civil union recognized by the government. The separation of church and state, a cornerstone of American democracy, should be upheld and respected in this context.\n\nMoreover, concerns about the impact of gay couples on the community and the potential influence on children are often overstated. Research indicates that children of gay parents fare just as well as those raised by heterosexual couples, with no significant differences in emotional or social development. The key determinant is not sexual orientation but rather the quality of parenting.\n\nUltimately, I argue for federal legislation that legalizes same-sex marriage nationwide. The current patchwork of state laws is inefficient and discriminatory. The federal government should take a leadership role in this matter, rather than leaving it to individual states to decide. Yet, it is crucial to recognize that any legislation must be informed by evidence-based research and not merely religious or cultural biases.\n\nPresident Bush's staunch opposition to same-sex marriage is rooted in his religious beliefs, which is understandable. However, it is problematic when these beliefs are translated into public policy, particularly given the federal government's historical stance on religious neutrality. The recent controversy over the pledge of allegiance, for example, illustrates the sensitivity around religious symbols in public life.\n\nLastly, it is essential to dispel the misconceptions surrounding homosexuality. The notion that it is a result of psychological trauma or personality defects has been debunked by numerous scientific studies. The American Psychological Association, among other authoritative institutions, has refuted such claims. It is imperative that public discourse on this topic is informed by empirical evidence rather than popular opinion or cultural biases.",
            "In the course of my summer work at a hospital pharmacy, I've encountered a recurring theme that often confounds me: the stigma surrounding certain substances. While it's true that the illegality of a drug doesn't necessarily equate to its lack of potential benefits, I must assert that my stance is nuanced. I affirm that while the public consumption of these substances should be restricted, their medicinal use should be considered.\n\nTo elucidate, consider the controlled substances such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, and acetaminophen, which are widely used in medical settings despite their legality. These substances are not without their perils, but their benefits are undeniable. Marijuana, in my opinion, possesses similar potential. However, the public perception of marijuana as a harmful substance detracts from its responsible use.\n\nI propose a gradual legalization process, beginning with the elimination of the stigma associated with marijuana. This could be achieved through education and awareness campaigns. By doing so, I believe we can foster an environment where marijuana is used responsibly, both medically and recreationally.",
            "Well, over the years, the church has certainly evolved to better reflect the spirit of the twenty-first century. It's no longer as stringent as it once was. As a child, my Sundays were filled with church attendance, complete with cute little dresses, matching shoes, and a coordinating purse. I even attended a private school where many of my friends frequented the church on weekends. However, as I've grown older, the church has made notable adaptations. For instance, they've introduced a youth service that's only thirty minutes long, and the attire has become significantly more casual. Even in the morning masses, I now see people in jeans and khakis, a stark contrast to the more formal attire of the past. The church I know has indeed undergone these changes, but I'm not privy to the internal politics or the intricacies of its leadership. That's the extent of my observations.\n\nRegarding your questions about the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I believe that these incidents couldn't have been entirely prevented by the church simply by allowing female priests or permitting priests to marry. The root of the problem lies within the individual, not the institution. Some married individuals struggle with pedophilia, and their marital status doesn't alter their predispositions. If a person is predisposed to such behavior, they may seek it out regardless of marital status. The choice to become a priest is a personal one, and if someone feels called to the priesthood despite wanting to marry, they might consider a different faith that permits it, like Seventh Heaven, where ministers and reverends can marry.\n\nTo further clarify, I believe that sexual attraction, including pedophilia, is largely genetic. I don't think it's something that can be entirely influenced by upbringing or societal changes. Marriage, while it can provide a support system, doesn't change someone's genetic makeup. Therefore, I don't believe the church could have prevented these incidents through societal changes alone. If the church was aware of these cases and endeavored to cover them up, that would indeed be despicable, but I suspect that in many cases, the church may not have been aware of these incidents.",
            "In the wake of the September 11th events, I initially found the initial premise acceptable. However, I soon realized that the collective shock and grief made it easy for the Iraq War to be framed as a response to Osama Bin Laden and the alleged weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. These claims were later debunked, leaving a bitter taste in my mouth. The Bush administration's handling of the situation has always been a source of frustration for me, as the administration's lies about the justification for war have never been adequately addressed, even by those who were directly involved.\n\nI find it particularly galling that Colin Powell, who once presented the case for war with such conviction, now admits he was not persuaded by the evidence at the time. This, to me, is a clear example of malfeasance in office, approaching an impeachable offense. The Bush administration's disregard for the Constitution is not just an issue of the past; it has been ongoing since 9/11, with a clear intent to expand our energy supply and settle old scores, specifically with Saddam Hussein.\n\nWithdrawing from Iraq now could potentially lead to a civil war, with more lives lost. The proposed alternative—an intervention by neighboring nations like Syria and Saudi Arabia—also does not inspire confidence. The long-term stability of Iraq's sovereignty is uncertain, with the interim government's effectiveness questionable and radical elements vying for control.",
            "Hmm, let's see. What's this about? Oh, the war in Iraq. Okay. Well, it's like, I don't know much about it, really. It feels, I mean, it started as a response to something, right? Like, the attacks on September 11th. But now, I'm not sure it's making much sense. It's like, we're trying to build democracy there, which takes time, and we're doing it for our own interests too, like oil. It's just, it's not helping matters much. And if we stay, we'll be stuck there forever, trying to keep the peace, and if we leave, it'll be like we abandoned them. It's a tough situation. I don't know, it's hard to say if it's worth it. It's like, we're not at war with them, really. It's just a bunch of soldiers stationed there. It's like, we're showing off our power, but it's not a real war. And it shouldn't be called one. But, I don't know, I'm not sure if I should want it to end. It's just, it's complicated. It's like we're interfering in their culture and making things worse. It's like, we're trying to change them into something they're not. And it's going to end up causing more problems. I mean, there's so much going on there. It's like, it's a mess.

            "I’m hesitant to endorse the notion of making it legally binding or for a state to even recognize its legitimacy. I firmly believe that the decision should rest with the religious institutions, as the Constitution explicitly advocates for the separation of church and state. The guidelines are crystal clear, and any attempt to impose regulations or exert control over this issue would be a direct contradiction of the principles enshrined in the Constitution. Consequently, I maintain that the decision to legalize or ban this practice should not be imposed by the government but rather left to the discretion of religious bodies.\n\nMoreover, I am of the opinion that those advocating for its illegality are prioritizing one religious belief over others, as historical records indicate that the majority of Christians, particularly Catholics, are opposed to this practice. It is my perspective that the government should not impose its will on matters of faith and belief, as the Constitution promotes religious tolerance and freedom. Furthermore, I am skeptical about the proposed amendment, as I believe it would be a rare instance where the government seeks to restrict the people rather than itself.\n\nMy stance is that neither the federal government nor any other authority should intervene in this matter. The push for this amendment appears to be driven by personal religious beliefs rather than any broader societal or economic concerns. I do not foresee any significant impact on the economy or society as a result of this practice, and I believe that it could potentially have a positive effect on societal well-being. In essence, I maintain that the final decision should be left to the churches, and I do not see any compelling reasons to alter the current legal status through an amendment.",
            "In the realm of historical context, the war in Iraq is a topic that has long been a subject of scrutiny and debate. To commence, I firmly believe that the authorities did not provide the populace with a candid account of the reasons behind the decision to invade Iraq. The association drawn between the war and the terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, was tenuous at best, and the administration exploited the public's indignation to rally support for the invasion in 2003.\n\nI, myself, am staunchly opposed to military intervention, particularly when it involves preventive strikes. The conflict in Iraq, however, is a stark reminder of the Vietnam War's echoes. The American government's failure to adequately prepare for the aftermath and the chaos that ensued following the removal of the Iraqi government is a glaring oversight. The government's inability to anticipate the vacuum of power and the subsequent insurgency is a poignant lesson not learned from the past.\n\nThe efforts to establish a democratic government in Iraq, reminiscent of similar attempts in Vietnam, have proven to be a lengthy and arduous process. The US government's portrayal of a swift, successful campaign was, in hindsight, naive. Building a functional democracy takes time, as our own history attests, and the government's optimism about the ease of this endeavor was misplaced.\n\nThe decision to engage in war is a complex one, and the 2004 presidential election was a pivotal moment in my political awakening. I found myself grappling with the decision to support George W. Bush's continuation of the Iraq occupation. The responsibility to honor the sacrifices made and the lives lost is a heavy one, but so too is the responsibility to weigh the cost in human lives against the potential benefits of a democratic Iraq. The question of whether our intervention was motivated by altruism or strategic interests, particularly concerns over oil resources, is one that has fueled ongoing debate.\n\nThe war in Iraq serves as a reminder of the intricacies of foreign policy and the challenges of nation-building. Despite the best intentions, the ultimate outcome often depends on factors beyond our control. It is my sincere hope that the conflict will conclude soon, and that peace will prevail in the region, though I remain skeptical of such a swift resolution.",
            "I've always held the belief in the rightness of same-sex unions. It's a deeply personal choice, one that many now recognize as potentially having biological underpinnings rather than being solely influenced by societal norms. It seems inequitable to me that individuals might face reduced rights based on something largely beyond their control. I find it disheartening to think that people could be denied the same rights and opportunities due to their orientation. I've long been an advocate for full acceptance and equality in this regard.\n\nPolitics and government often interject themselves where they shouldn't. This is a matter of personal and household concern, not a state or national one. In my neighborhood, for instance, there are several openly gay couples, functioning just as any other family would, despite not being officially married due to legal restrictions. It's these everyday, ordinary examples that underscore the need for change.\n\nThe notion of interpreting the sacred institution of marriage through a political lens can be seen as an overreach. I've seen compelling evidence suggesting that sexual orientation might have biological roots, as opposed to being shaped solely by environment and upbringing. This perspective challenges the notion that such unions are any less valid or natural. It's akin to saying that individuals predisposed to heterosexuality should be denied marriage if they were raised in a single-parent household with multiple sisters, for instance.\n\nMoreover, the double standard seems glaring. Heterosexual couples can elope, marriage licenses aside, while same-sex couples often face public scrutiny and media attention. Marital choices, in my view, should be private affairs, not public spectacles.",
            "Posting something on the internet is akin to sharing it with the entire world. It's public, plain and simple. As a Resident Assistant, I've faced this issue firsthand. When you place something online, it shapes how people perceive you. If you discuss volatile topics such as violence, you can't escape scrutiny. The internet, after all, is accessible to everyone. If a friend on Myspace sees something concerning, they might inform the school. They can't ignore such information, as they must prevent potential dangers. However, not everything online should be taken seriously. Sometimes, people jest about such topics, and it might just be a misunderstanding. In our school, an incident occurred where someone misinterpreted a post as a threat. The person in question had intended it as a joke, but the situation escalated due to the context. It's essential to remember that the internet is a public space. If you don't want something to be seen, don't post it. You can't control how others interpret your posts. However, if school officials are made aware of a potential threat through legitimate means, they must take it seriously. They shouldn't, however, snoop through students' social media accounts under false pretenses. If a student brings it to their attention, it falls under a different category. In conclusion, while the internet is a public forum, it's crucial to be mindful of what you post and who you share it with.",
            "The conflict has stretched on interminably, and I find it hard to discern the original intent. Initially, it seemed the goal was to instill democratic principles in a nation, but over time, that objective appears to have been lost sight of. It seems we are now engaged in this endeavor more for the sake of global dominance than for any clear political purpose. I believe the initial motivations were questionable, possibly influenced by personal connections between the current and previous administrations. If the purpose was to introduce democracy into a system lacking it, that was a noble aim. However, if personal concerns played a part, then I question the fairness of the cause. I believe our objective was made clear within the first few months of the conflict, yet it has persisted for years.\n\nI maintain that the war's duration has reached a point where it is no longer serving its initial purpose. It feels as if we are engaged in this for the sake of engaging in it, and we are reluctant to end it without a clear victory. I believe it is time to reconsider our involvement, as the local government is now capable of managing its affairs independently. Moreover, our economy is bearing the brunt of this conflict, as we invest billions in a war while our own issues, such as poverty and infrastructure, remain unaddressed. It seems our resources would be better spent on our own citizens' well-being rather than sustaining a war that has lost its focus. The immense financial investment in this conflict is a drain on our economy and should be redirected towards more pressing domestic needs.\n\nI believe it is time to reassess our involvement and prioritize our own internal projects and improvements.",
            "Regarding your recent inquiry, I'd like to pose a question to clarify the situation. It seems that a certain event was averted due to someone's online activity. Notably, on platforms like Myspace, one's information is publicly accessible, much like a storefront. To access someone's profile, one typically needs to be their \"friend,\" thereby granting permission for that person to view their profile. However, I acknowledge that sharing information online inherently invites scrutiny.\n\nIt's challenging to ascertain how one would effectively monitor all students' online activities. While it's understandable that schools might want to ensure students' safety, it's crucial to consider the potential for bias and invasion. If a school were to assign someone to monitor profiles, it could potentially lead to targeted surveillance. This raises ethical concerns, as it could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nI, for one, maintain a Facebook account, though I'm conscious that it's a double-edged sword. There are certainly unsavory individuals who can exploit this information for nefarious purposes. A television program I watched highlighted a man who managed to find a girl's screen name and engage with her within minutes, ultimately arranging a meeting. Personally, I wouldn't meet someone I don't know, but I've had classmates who recognize me, despite not knowing my screen name. This raises concerns about privacy, as they can piece together information about my life.\n\nBalancing the benefits of social media with the risks is tricky. I only accept friend requests from acquaintances, but it's impossible to know who might be looking at one's profile. My roommate mentioned that her high school prohibited students from having Myspace accounts, which seemed quite restrictive. I question the school's authority to impose such a restriction.\n\nIn summary, while I understand the concerns, I believe there needs to be a balance between privacy and safety.",
            "Indeed,\nI find myself compelled to discuss the Iraq War one more time, though I must admit, I hesitate as it's a topic that often feels insincere when addressed.\nYou see, I was opposed from the outset, yet it's wiser not to dwell on sentiments that no longer matter.\nIt's evident that the majority of the world, including the Iraqis themselves, view the war negatively, with upwards of eighty percent supporting a swift withdrawal.\nThe troops stationed there, too, share this sentiment, with a significant portion believing a departure within the year is necessary.\nThe situation is, and has been, a catastrophe from the moment we entered, and it's clear our presence has only exacerbated this.\nThe Middle East's cultural differences pose a formidable obstacle to our attempts to impose Western ideals.\nSaddam Hussein was undoubtedly a tyrant, but the cost of intervention was not justified, given the potential for chaos and instability.\nMy perspective is that we should exit immediately, and though I understand the administration may have reasons for extending our stay, I remain unconvinced.\nThe Iraqis themselves, who we claim to be helping, have expressed desires for our departure, and listening to them should be our priority.\nIf they request our withdrawal, it would remove us from the equation should the situation deteriorate further.\nAfter all, while we may never be seen as saviors in the region, at least we would have acted on the will of those we claim to support.",
            "It is evident that gender discrimination persists in the United States, albeit in various forms. While not exclusively targeting women, certain occupations may still harbor biases. For instance, the \"glass ceiling\" phenomenon, where women encounter barriers to advancement despite equal qualifications, remains a challenge. This is partly due to societal perceptions that women are less suited for upper-management roles.\n\nMoreover, roles that were historically male-dominated, such as stay-at-home fathers, often face societal disapproval. Conversely, men in fields like fashion may face skepticism due to societal perceptions of their gender and lifestyle. Change, though gradual, is underway as more women secure executive positions and gain acceptance in the business world. Similarly, the acceptance of male stay-at-home parents is growing.\n\nAddressing these issues involves promoting the unique qualities of those stereotypically discriminated against, rather than forcefully pushing for change. This approach respects the pace of societal evolution and acknowledges the progress already made. Additionally, barriers due to regional backgrounds and educational levels also exist. For instance, a CEO with a rural upbringing might face discrimination due to less-than-perfect grammar. These examples illustrate the complex nature of discrimination and the need for ongoing efforts to combat it.",
            "The understanding is that it hasn't been legalized, but rather, decriminalized. This shift reduces the severity of the offense from a criminal one to something more akin to a minor infraction, akin to a traffic ticket. For instance, instead of being arrested and processed through the legal system, individuals are simply cited. This change doesn't eliminate the potential future impacts, such as those on employment prospects, but it does reduce the immediate legal consequences and associated costs. The cost of law enforcement and court proceedings is substantial, particularly for financially struggling municipalities. Therefore, some communities are hesitant to decriminalize marijuana. However, in places like Denver, where the social and political climate is more open-minded, decriminalization is seen as a viable option. This can free up resources for community services, such as education, social programs for the elderly, and aid for the homeless. It's important to strike a balance; while marijuana should not be prevalent everywhere, its decriminalization can have financial benefits. However, it's crucial to consider the societal implications, such as the acceptability of openly smoking marijuana and the potential impact on driving safety. Both alcohol and marijuana can affect individuals differently, with each substance having its own set of potential negative effects. No two people react the same to substances, and personal moderation is key. Despite the differences in individual reactions, both substances have their own adverse effects. The general consensus is that they both should be approached with caution.",
            "I would lean towards affirming the notion\nGiven that\nMany of their practices are steeped in tradition\nThus, they've maintained the same rituals over extended periods\nAnd\nIt's beneficial to remain anchored in tradition\nHowever, it's equally crucial to be flexible to change\nIndeed\nMany Catholics adhere to the weekly attendance at Mass\nAnd\nThey're stringent about maintaining certain protocols\nAdditionally\nThere's a perception that the Catholic Church exhibits a certain attitude towards those who deviate from the doctrine\nEven\nIt seems that they're not receptive to individuals who aren't fully aligned with the Catholic faith\nMoreover\nFor instance, my parents' interfaith union was declined by the Catholic Church due to my father's Episcopalian background\nClearly\nThis isn't a demonstration of tolerance towards other religions\nDespite being taught to love others, the Catholic Church's practice often contradicts this principle\nIn essence, the doctrine instructs one to love and accept all, yet the Church's behavior suggests otherwise\nIt's as if the Church is wedded to outdated practices which they continue to uphold\n\nI don't believe this situation would significantly impact the issue\nIn my opinion, allowing priests to marry might be a positive step\nBut\nI don't anticipate it would prevent pedophilic behavior\nAs\nIt lies in a different sphere\nMoreover\nIndividuals who commit such acts would likely continue to do so irrespective of their marital status\nSince the target isn't a spouse but a child\nIt appears that such acts would transpire regardless of marriage status\nTherefore, I don't think permitting priests to marry would mitigate these issues",
            "I'm still deliberating on the issue of same-sex marriage, and I must admit, I'm torn. On one hand, it's a highly sensitive topic, balancing on the precipice of church and state. Defining marriage, especially when it comes to same-sex unions, is a thorny endeavor, as it involves navigating complex social and legal landscapes.\n\nI believe that, in terms of government recognition, civil unions are the way to go. If two people choose to unite, shouldn't the government treat it as such, regardless of the religious or cultural context? After all, people who are baptized or belong to certain religions don't receive special government treatment based on that alone. Therefore, I think the government should approach the matter with a neutral stance, recognizing the union for what it is.\n\nIf all states can agree on a logical course of action, then I believe a federal law should be implemented. However, I firmly believe that amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage is an overreach. This would be a disproportionate response to a complex social issue. It's not that I don't believe in the importance of the issue, but I don't believe it's significant enough to warrant a constitutional amendment.\n\nIn a nutshell, I don't support amending the constitution to ban same-sex marriage. It's not the right approach to address this matter.",
            "Growing up in a religious household, the subject of homosexuality has been a complex and intriguing topic for me. While I have a plethora of friends who identify as LGBTQ+, I must admit that I have reservations about their lifestyle. However, I firmly believe in the legalization of same-sex relations and advocate for a state-by-state decision process rather than a federal one. I believe that each state should have the autonomy to determine its stance on the matter, as policies should reflect the values and beliefs of the people who live there. Furthermore, I find it problematic when a national figure, such as the president, attempts to impose their views on the entire country. After all, they do not reside in every state, and their policies should not supersede the collective will of the people living in their respective communities. Therefore, I stand in favor of leaving these decisions in the hands of the individual states, as they are the ones who will ultimately bear the consequences of their choices.",
            "Well, to begin with, I don't think it's accurate to assert that MySpace is a private platform. According to the definition, it's a bulletin board meant for public consumption. When we put something online, we should expect various individuals, including educators, to view it. It's a public sphere, and while I understand the concern about privacy, if the information is accessible to the public, it's not a violation per se. However, if the intent is purely to monitor students' activities to maintain a safer environment, that's a different story.\n\nConsider, for instance, if a student posts about their involvement in harmful activities. If the school officials witness this and it aids in preventing a tragedy, like a school shooting, can we really call that an invasion of privacy? It's a delicate balance, but I believe it's acceptable to use public platforms for this purpose when it's to ensure the safety and well-being of students.\n\nI must admit, I've often hesitated to express myself freely online, even through electronic communication. I'm not particularly eager to share anything that could potentially be used against me later. The digital trail we leave behind can come back to haunt us. I've had experiences where I've refrained from sharing even mundane facts about others due to fear of misinterpretation. It's a constant vigilance, and I believe it's a prudent practice, especially for students who might not understand the full implications of their online actions.\n\nBut, returning to the topic at hand, if the information accessed is used to enhance the safety of the school environment, it's not an invasion. It's more about the integrity and responsibility of the school system to ensure a safe space for its students. After all, parents expect their children to be in a safe and secure environment when they entrust them to the system.\n\nFurthermore, schools have been proactive in preparing for various threats, including school shootings. Lockdown drills, security protocols, and surveillance are all measures taken to safeguard students. In this context, if school officials are using available information to maintain this safe environment, I wouldn't consider it an invasion of privacy. Instead, it's a responsibility they've undertaken to ensure the well-being of their students.\n\nSo, in conclusion, while I understand the concern about privacy, I believe the balance tips towards the responsibility and the necessity of the school system to ensure the safety of its students, especially in the context of a potentially dangerous situation like a school shooting.",
            "In the aftermath of the devastating events of September 11th, I was initially swayed by a strong desire for retribution. The sentiment was understandable, as the attacks hit close to home. At first, I was enthusiastic about the idea of invading and causing as much upheaval as the terrorists had done here. However, with hindsight, it's clear that we overlooked many critical factors and acted impulsively, without a well-thought-out plan. The decision to go to war was emotionally driven and lacked a clear strategy. We entered the conflict underprepared, unaware of what we would face and the unique nature of warfare in that region. The mindset was largely one of vengeance, rather than rational consideration of long-term consequences or cultural differences.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to declare war on Iraq was, to some extent, a response to public sentiment. However, it appeared to be more of a knee-jerk reaction than a carefully considered policy. The lack of a clear plan for what to do once in Iraq only exacerbated the situation. The absence of a cohesive strategy and unity of purpose among our forces made it challenging to establish order. It is my belief that we were more driven by anger and revenge than by a genuine desire to improve the lives of the people in Iraq.\n\nMoreover, I have come to question the effectiveness of our involvement in the region. The constant conflict has been more harmful than helpful. The people of Iraq seem to be more focused on their internal struggles than on improving their country, and our presence there has not significantly altered this dynamic. I believe that our continued engagement in the area is more likely to exacerbate the problems than to resolve them. Ultimately, I feel that we should step back and allow the region to find its own path, rather than attempting to impose our will from the outside.\n\nIn summary, while the desire for justice was understandable, the execution of our military efforts was flawed. We acted impulsively and failed to consider the long-term implications and cultural differences. The ongoing conflict has not produced the desired results, and I believe that our withdrawal is the best course of action."
