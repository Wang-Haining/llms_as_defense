            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are losing interest in the Church. One reason is that the Church is not open to many things. For example, the Church has strong views on gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are not modern. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on these issues. The Church's views are old-fashioned. The Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same thing is true for gay marriage.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God and give their lives to the Church. But people in other jobs have families and other responsibilities. I do not see why priests cannot have these things too.",

They should not be blamed for how they are born.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide. It is not a matter of law or morality. It is just about treating people fairly. Gay people should not be blamed for how they are born. They should be allowed to live their lives like everyone else.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved. It has nothing to do with the country's safety. It is just about treating people fairly. They should not interfere in people's lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family. However, this is not true. It's a different kind of relationship. There are many different aspects to it, and it can't be compared to a traditional marriage.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. However, they are the same thing. \n\nThere are many civil rights that come with marriage, like taxes and health care. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. They're not considered family.\n\nI think this is silly. If you're going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany scientific studies have been done on this issue. They show that gay couples have the same kinds of relationships as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to happiness.\n\nIt's just a relationship. It's the same thing. People get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. Gay couples are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government gives civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in their relationships. People worry about adoption and community issues. They're concerned about how gay couples will affect the community and children.\n\nHowever, this is new and hard to understand. It's hard to say what will happen to children of gay couples. They may be treated badly by their peers or other adults.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. In public schools, they get beaten up. Parents protest to get their children removed from school.\n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not, just like anyone else.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. His views are not necessarily mine. Most of the reasons he gives are moral reasons. However, morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to ignore the morality of other groups and go along with what some religious groups believe. This is hypocritical, especially considering the controversy about the Pledge of Allegiance and \"under God.\"\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not true.\n\nIf people listened to experts and research, the world would be a different place.",
            "This summer I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I think a drug's legality does not mean it has good qualities. So, I think it is good to use marijuana for medical purposes, but not make it available to the public. We use many illegal drugs in pharmacies, like oxycodone and vicodin. They are good and safe when used correctly. If we do not use marijuana because it is not legal, then we are not giving its good qualities a chance. We should permit its use for medical reasons.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either substance, it can be bad for you. I think we should allow marijuana to be used, but we should do it slowly. If we make it legal too fast, people may use it too much. I think we should remove the bad image people have of marijuana. It is not as bad as some other drugs.\n\nIf people think marijuana is not so bad, they may use it responsibly. They can use it for medical reasons, and it might help people feel better.",
            "The Catholic Church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it once was. I grew up attending church every Sunday. I would wear a cute dress and matching shoes. It was a big deal. My friends and I would see each other there on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter mass, just thirty minutes, and people dress more casually. During the summer, some people even wear beach clothes. Families come late, and it is not a big deal.\n\nThe church I attend is changing. I don't know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change is that people dress more casually. It is not as formal as it used to be.\n\nI don't think the church could have prevented the accusations against priests. Some men become pedophiles, even if they are married. It is not the church's rules that cause this. If a man wants to be a priest, it is his choice. There are other religions that allow priests to be married. If they want to be married, they could consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is genetic. People are born with it. It is not something they become. They may try to hide it, but it will come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is shameful.

But that was not true. This made me very upset.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Even Colin Powell, who was a big part of the decision, said he was not sure of the evidence.\n\nI think it is wrong for a president to lie. It is a big mistake. The Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They wanted to do what they wanted, not what the law said.\n\nThe US went to war in Iraq with the intention of taking control. The Secretary of the Treasury wrote a book saying that President Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to remove Saddam Hussein because his father did not like him.

            "I do not think it is right for a state or the government to make marijuana legal. I believe it should be left to the churches. The Constitution says there should be separation of church and state. This is clear. We should not try to enforce laws about something that is against one church's rules if it is not against the rules of another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana use, except in some areas.\n\nThe idea of making marijuana illegal is a matter of church rules, not government rules. The Constitution allows for religious freedom. Some people wanted to change the Constitution to make it clear, but I do not think that is the right thing to do. It would be against what is already written.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. It allows for people to have different beliefs. If we change the Constitution, it would be wrong. It would also be the only amendment that would restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in making marijuana laws. I do not see why the president is pushing for a ban. He is a Catholic and it seems like he is trying to push his own beliefs on others. It is up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government. The president's push for a ban is just his own personal belief.\n\nI do not see how a ban would help the economy.

            "The war in Iraq started in 2003. I do not think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people to make them support the war.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was like the Vietnam War. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war. Many American soldiers died. Removing a country's government is not easy. The government was not prepared for the void of power and chaos that came after the war.\n\nThe US government tried to put a democratic government in place. This was also the goal in Vietnam. But the government should have known that it would be a long and hard process. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made it seem like it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. But it is not easy to implement a new form of government. Democracy was a long struggle in the US too.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. I wanted to let him finish what he started. But now I think the US should not abandon the people of Iraq. We took their government and way of life. We should see it through to the end. But there are many American casualties.\n\nI think the main reason we invaded Iraq was for the oil. We need oil, and Iraq has it. The US government is not honest about its reasons for going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade them.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. It is a personal preference, and it is something that research has shown is often biological, not just a result of how we are raised. \n\nI think it's wrong to deny people rights because of something they can't control. It's not fair or kind. I have always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal and private matter. It's not just about the state or the country, it's about individuals and families. \n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they can't. But they are like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like everyone else. \n\nI think it's wrong when the government tries to decide what marriage means. This is not just about the law, it's about people's lives. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nI've read that some people are born gay. It's a chemical thing in the brain. It's not just about how people are raised. For example, someone who grows up with many sisters and no brothers might be more likely to be gay.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that marriage is not a public event. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without announcing it to the world. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big deal. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't have any other reasons.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. As a resident assistant, I have dealt with this problem before. \n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you write about violence or shootings, people will think you are a threat. The internet is public. If someone sees something bad, they can tell a school official. The school has to act quickly. They cannot ignore a threat. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is serious and what is not. Some people just joke around online. You have to be careful. \n\nIn my school, someone overheard something that sounded serious. They called the school, and we found out who the person was.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe initial purpose was good - to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe father of the president who started the war had a problem with the leader of the country we were fighting. \nI think it's not fair to go to war for personal reasons. \nI believe we achieved our goal in the first few months of the war. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty and illness. \nWe should not spend so much money on a long war. \nThere are many important things we need to fix at home, like roads, schools, and health care. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe goal was good - to bring democracy to a country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty, illness, and schools. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be a long-term problem for us. \nWe have many other problems, like poverty, illness, and roads. \nWe should fix these problems at home, not spend money on a war. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nI think the money could be better spent on things that help our country. \n\nI think that's my opinion.",
            "I have a question about something that happened online. It seems that someone looked at a person's information on the internet and was able to stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nThis person found information on the internet because someone had made it available. They must have been friends with the person who posted the information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you have to think that many people will see them. You can't control who sees your information. So it's good that someone was able to find this information and help.\n\nBut it's also a problem. It's not fair to have one person watching everyone's information all the time. It's like treating some people differently. We can't have someone watching people all the time to make sure they're not doing something bad.\n\nIt's like having someone's job to look at people's information on the internet. That's not fair. But maybe it's okay if someone finds information by accident.\n\nI have a Facebook account, not Myspace. I know that some people can see my information. There are people who want to know things about me. They can find my screen name and talk to me on the internet. It's hard to know who these people are.\n\nYou can put some things on the internet, but you can also be careful. I try not to put too much information on my Facebook. But I also want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that didn't allow students to have Myspace. I don't think that's right. The school can't tell students what they can and can't do on the internet.\n\nThat's my thought on this issue.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it at first. But now it's not important to me anymore. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and around the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population think this. Eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want the US to leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before the US invasion. Now it's even worse. There is no easy way to solve problems in the Middle East. The US and Middle Eastern countries have big cultural differences. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries, but the people there might not want that.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought before invading his country. We made a big mistake. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand - it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. The government has not given a good reason to stay. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I wouldn't mind. But I think we should leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want the US to leave. They're the people we're trying to help. If they say we should go, we should listen. That way, we can't say we were not asked to leave.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but the Iraqis didn't want us to stay. At least we'll be the good guys. Well, not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \nIt's not just for women, though. I think it also depends on the job you're doing. \nWomen often have a harder time getting ahead because of the way society has been raised. \nEven though we are supposed to have equal rights, many people have trouble working for a woman if they are a man. \nThis is because of how things have been for a long time. \nIn many workplaces, women see a job they are qualified for, but are not chosen for it because it's not common for women to be in high positions. \nThe same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \nSociety often looks down on men who stay home with their children. \nThey should be the ones working and making money, right? \nThis can be hard for them because maybe they've always wanted to take care of their children. \nIf they are married, their wife may have a good job and be working. \nBut society doesn't understand this and looks down on men who stay home. \nIn the fashion industry, some people don't take men seriously if they are straight. \nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because men who like fashion often have a different style of life. \nIf a man is in fashion and has a typical life, people may wonder if he really knows about fashion or if he just follows what women like. \nIt depends on the job you're in, but I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States. \nChanging it is hard because society has a set way of thinking. \nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow. \nI think if we keep working at the pace we are now, women will continue to get more opportunities and become more accepted in business. \nMore men are also staying home with their children and being accepted. \nAs people see the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped, they will start to understand them better. \nWe don't need to be too pushy about it, but just show the good qualities of these people. \nIf we do it too fast, people will resist. \nWe're at a good balance now, and change takes time. \n\nI also think people are often discriminated against because of where they're from or how they speak. \nIf you grew up on a farm and didn't learn how to speak well, but you're very smart, you might still be able to get a good job. \nBut other men might look down on you because they think you might not be smart if you can't speak well. \nSo, yes, people can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their gender. \nThis is another example.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it less serious to get. Now it is like a traffic ticket. You get in trouble, but not as bad as before. You don't have to go to jail.\n\nPeople worry about the future. They don't want a record for something like this. Even if it is not a big deal now, it can still hurt them later.\n\nBut some people think it costs a lot to arrest people and take them to court. They say it is better to not do this and use the money for other things. Some cities are hurting financially, so they do not want to do this.\n\nOne city that changed the rules is Denver. People there are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. Now the city has more money to spend on things like education and food for people who need it.\n\nSome people are worried that if marijuana is legal, people will smoke it everywhere. They will drive and smoke. This is not good. And some people do not like the idea of marijuana being out in the open.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for driving. Marijuana can also be bad for people's lives. But people react differently to substances. Some people can handle them well. Others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But both marijuana and alcohol have bad effects.",
            "I agree. Here's why: Many things the Catholic Church does are very traditional. They do things the same way for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be flexible to change.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules exactly. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was an Episcopalian too. My mom was a Catholic, but they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. This is not very tolerant.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. I feel like some Catholic rules tell you to do things, but the way the Church practices goes against it. The rules are old-fashioned, but the Church continues to follow them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. If someone wants to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.\n\nPeople who hurt children will do it regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about the child, not the spouse. So, allowing priests to be married would not stop this from happening.",
            "I do not have a strong opinion on this issue. I am not sure if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult topic because it is close to the separation of church and state. It is also hard to define what marriage is without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a special union between two people. Some people think it is a sacrament. Others do not believe in a government definition of marriage. They think the government should not decide what kind of marriage is okay.\n\nIf two people get married, they should have the same rights as other married couples. They should not be treated unfairly. If the government gives tax breaks to married people, it should give them to all married couples, not just some.\n\nThe idea of gay marriage is that two people of the same sex can get married. Some people do not think this is right. But it is not a big enough issue to change the constitution. The constitution should not be changed just to ban gay marriage.\n\nIt is not important enough to make a law that says who can and cannot get married. The government should not decide who is married and who is not.\n\nI do not think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a good idea.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I have many gay friends, but I do not totally agree with that lifestyle. However, I believe it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national decision.\n\nI think a state should decide for itself whether to allow gay marriage. Many states are democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision.\n\nYou chose to live in that state. If you do not agree with the decision, you can move to a different state. I believe homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should be able to decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide what the whole country thinks about gay marriage. I believe it should be up to each state.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I think the president should not decide how each state should behave. He does not live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. President Bush will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nI do not have an opinion about that.",
            "I don't agree with the school officials looking at students' Myspace pages. If you post something on the internet, you know it will be seen by others. This includes school officials. They can still find out what you are doing even if your Myspace page is not under the school's name. They can look at it from their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is okay if they look at Myspace to prevent school shootings. If they can save lives, that is a good thing. School officials have a responsibility to keep students safe.\n\nIt is like when they check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to catch students who are doing something wrong. I think this is an invasion of privacy. But, if they can make the school a better and safer place, it is okay.\n\nEverything on the internet can be seen by others. If you post something on Myspace, it will be there forever. This can hurt you later in life. If you do something wrong, it can be hard to get out of trouble.\n\nSchool officials should not check Myspace just to catch students. But, if they have a reason, it is okay. Like when they make sure the school is safe. This is like when they practice lock downs to be ready for bad things to happen.\n\nThey did this to prepare for something like the Columbine school shooting. They wanted to keep students safe. I think this is what school officials were doing in this case. They were making the school a safer place.",
            "I was for the war in Iraq at first. I thought it was a good idea to go there after nine eleven. But now I am against it. I think we had no plan and were not prepared.\n\nWe went to Iraq because of anger and emotion, not because we thought about the long-term effects. We did not think about what would happen after we arrived. As a result, things did not go well.\n\nThe people in Iraq fight among themselves. They cannot work together. If they fight each other, they cannot fight against us. We went to Iraq to help, but we are not making a difference. We are actually hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They use strong methods and are not interested in making their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nWe went to Iraq looking for revenge. We wanted to punish them for what happened on nine eleven. But we should have thought about the consequences. We should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe cannot change the people in Iraq. They will always be the same. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. When we leave, things will get worse. So, it is better for us to leave now.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. We are not doing enough good to stay in Iraq. We should just leave and stop hurting ourselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are losing interest in the Church. One reason is that the Church is not open to many things. For example, the Church has strong views on gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are not modern. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on these issues. The Church's views are old-fashioned. The Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same thing is true for gay marriage.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God and give their lives to the Church. But people in other jobs have families and other responsibilities. I do not see why priests cannot have these things too.",

They should not be blamed for how they are born.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide. It is not a matter of law or morality. It is just about treating people fairly. Gay people should not be blamed for how they are born. They should be allowed to live their lives like everyone else.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved. It has nothing to do with the country's safety. It is just about treating people fairly. They should not interfere in people's lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family. However, this is not true. It's a different kind of relationship. There are many different aspects to it, and it can't be compared to a traditional marriage.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. However, they are the same thing. \n\nThere are many civil rights that come with marriage, like taxes and health care. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. They're not considered family.\n\nI think this is silly. If you're going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany scientific studies have been done on this issue. They show that gay couples have the same kinds of relationships as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to happiness.\n\nIt's just a relationship. It's the same thing. People get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. Gay couples are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government gives civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in their relationships. People worry about adoption and community issues. They're concerned about how gay couples will affect the community and children.\n\nHowever, this is new and hard to understand. It's hard to say what will happen to children of gay couples. They may be treated badly by their peers or other adults.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. In public schools, they get beaten up. Parents protest to get their children removed from school.\n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not, just like anyone else.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. His views are not necessarily mine. Most of the reasons he gives are moral reasons. However, morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to ignore the morality of other groups and go along with what some religious groups believe. This is hypocritical, especially considering the controversy about the Pledge of Allegiance and \"under God.\"\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not true.\n\nIf people listened to experts and research, the world would be a different place.",
            "This summer I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I think a drug's legality does not mean it has good qualities. So, I think it is good to use marijuana for medical purposes, but not make it available to the public. We use many illegal drugs in pharmacies, like oxycodone and vicodin. They are good and safe when used correctly. If we do not use marijuana because it is not legal, then we are not giving its good qualities a chance. We should permit its use for medical reasons.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either substance, it can be bad for you. I think we should allow marijuana to be used, but we should do it slowly. If we make it legal too fast, people may use it too much. I think we should remove the bad image people have of marijuana. It is not as bad as some other drugs.\n\nIf people think marijuana is not so bad, they may use it responsibly. They can use it for medical reasons, and it might help people feel better.",
            "The Catholic Church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it once was. I grew up attending church every Sunday. I would wear a cute dress and matching shoes. It was a big deal. My friends and I would see each other there on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter mass, just thirty minutes, and people dress more casually. During the summer, some people even wear beach clothes. Families come late, and it is not a big deal.\n\nThe church I attend is changing. I don't know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change is that people dress more casually. It is not as formal as it used to be.\n\nI don't think the church could have prevented the accusations against priests. Some men become pedophiles, even if they are married. It is not the church's rules that cause this. If a man wants to be a priest, it is his choice. There are other religions that allow priests to be married. If they want to be married, they could consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is genetic. People are born with it. It is not something they become. They may try to hide it, but it will come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is shameful.

But that was not true. This made me very upset.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Even Colin Powell, who was a big part of the decision, said he was not sure of the evidence.\n\nI think it is wrong for a president to lie. It is a big mistake. The Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They wanted to do what they wanted, not what the law said.\n\nThe US went to war in Iraq with the intention of taking control. The Secretary of the Treasury wrote a book saying that President Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to remove Saddam Hussein because his father did not like him.

            "I do not think it is right for a state or the government to make marijuana legal. I believe it should be left to the churches. The Constitution says there should be separation of church and state. This is clear. We should not try to enforce laws about something that is against one church's rules if it is not against the rules of another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana use, except in some areas.\n\nThe idea of making marijuana illegal is a matter of church rules, not government rules. The Constitution allows for religious freedom. Some people wanted to change the Constitution to make it clear, but I do not think that is the right thing to do. It would be against what is already written.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. It allows for people to have different beliefs. If we change the Constitution, it would be wrong. It would also be the only amendment that would restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in making marijuana laws. I do not see why the president is pushing for a ban. He is a Catholic and it seems like he is trying to push his own beliefs on others. It is up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government. The president's push for a ban is just his own personal belief.\n\nI do not see how a ban would help the economy.

            "The war in Iraq started in 2003. I do not think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people to make them support the war.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was like the Vietnam War. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war. Many American soldiers died. Removing a country's government is not easy. The government was not prepared for the void of power and chaos that came after the war.\n\nThe US government tried to put a democratic government in place. This was also the goal in Vietnam. But the government should have known that it would be a long and hard process. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made it seem like it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. But it is not easy to implement a new form of government. Democracy was a long struggle in the US too.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. I wanted to let him finish what he started. But now I think the US should not abandon the people of Iraq. We took their government and way of life. We should see it through to the end. But there are many American casualties.\n\nI think the main reason we invaded Iraq was for the oil. We need oil, and Iraq has it. The US government is not honest about its reasons for going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade them.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. It is a personal preference, and it is something that research has shown is often biological, not just a result of how we are raised. \n\nI think it's wrong to deny people rights because of something they can't control. It's not fair or kind. I have always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal and private matter. It's not just about the state or the country, it's about individuals and families. \n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they can't. But they are like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like everyone else. \n\nI think it's wrong when the government tries to decide what marriage means. This is not just about the law, it's about people's lives. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nI've read that some people are born gay. It's a chemical thing in the brain. It's not just about how people are raised. For example, someone who grows up with many sisters and no brothers might be more likely to be gay.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that marriage is not a public event. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without announcing it to the world. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big deal. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't have any other reasons.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. As a resident assistant, I have dealt with this problem before. \n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you write about violence or shootings, people will think you are a threat. The internet is public. If someone sees something bad, they can tell a school official. The school has to act quickly. They cannot ignore a threat. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is serious and what is not. Some people just joke around online. You have to be careful. \n\nIn my school, someone overheard something that sounded serious. They called the school, and we found out who the person was.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe initial purpose was good - to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe father of the president who started the war had a problem with the leader of the country we were fighting. \nI think it's not fair to go to war for personal reasons. \nI believe we achieved our goal in the first few months of the war. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty and illness. \nWe should not spend so much money on a long war. \nThere are many important things we need to fix at home, like roads, schools, and health care. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe goal was good - to bring democracy to a country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty, illness, and schools. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be a long-term problem for us. \nWe have many other problems, like poverty, illness, and roads. \nWe should fix these problems at home, not spend money on a war. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nI think the money could be better spent on things that help our country. \n\nI think that's my opinion.",
            "I have a question about something that happened online. It seems that someone looked at a person's information on the internet and was able to stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nThis person found information on the internet because someone had made it available. They must have been friends with the person who posted the information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you have to think that many people will see them. You can't control who sees your information. So it's good that someone was able to find this information and help.\n\nBut it's also a problem. It's not fair to have one person watching everyone's information all the time. It's like treating some people differently. We can't have someone watching people all the time to make sure they're not doing something bad.\n\nIt's like having someone's job to look at people's information on the internet. That's not fair. But maybe it's okay if someone finds information by accident.\n\nI have a Facebook account, not Myspace. I know that some people can see my information. There are people who want to know things about me. They can find my screen name and talk to me on the internet. It's hard to know who these people are.\n\nYou can put some things on the internet, but you can also be careful. I try not to put too much information on my Facebook. But I also want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that didn't allow students to have Myspace. I don't think that's right. The school can't tell students what they can and can't do on the internet.\n\nThat's my thought on this issue.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it at first. But now it's not important to me anymore. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and around the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population think this. Eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want the US to leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before the US invasion. Now it's even worse. There is no easy way to solve problems in the Middle East. The US and Middle Eastern countries have big cultural differences. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries, but the people there might not want that.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought before invading his country. We made a big mistake. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand - it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. The government has not given a good reason to stay. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I wouldn't mind. But I think we should leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want the US to leave. They're the people we're trying to help. If they say we should go, we should listen. That way, we can't say we were not asked to leave.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but the Iraqis didn't want us to stay. At least we'll be the good guys. Well, not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \nIt's not just for women, though. I think it also depends on the job you're doing. \nWomen often have a harder time getting ahead because of the way society has been raised. \nEven though we are supposed to have equal rights, many people have trouble working for a woman if they are a man. \nThis is because of how things have been for a long time. \nIn many workplaces, women see a job they are qualified for, but are not chosen for it because it's not common for women to be in high positions. \nThe same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \nSociety often looks down on men who stay home with their children. \nThey should be the ones working and making money, right? \nThis can be hard for them because maybe they've always wanted to take care of their children. \nIf they are married, their wife may have a good job and be working. \nBut society doesn't understand this and looks down on men who stay home. \nIn the fashion industry, some people don't take men seriously if they are straight. \nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because men who like fashion often have a different style of life. \nIf a man is in fashion and has a typical life, people may wonder if he really knows about fashion or if he just follows what women like. \nIt depends on the job you're in, but I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States. \nChanging it is hard because society has a set way of thinking. \nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow. \nI think if we keep working at the pace we are now, women will continue to get more opportunities and become more accepted in business. \nMore men are also staying home with their children and being accepted. \nAs people see the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped, they will start to understand them better. \nWe don't need to be too pushy about it, but just show the good qualities of these people. \nIf we do it too fast, people will resist. \nWe're at a good balance now, and change takes time. \n\nI also think people are often discriminated against because of where they're from or how they speak. \nIf you grew up on a farm and didn't learn how to speak well, but you're very smart, you might still be able to get a good job. \nBut other men might look down on you because they think you might not be smart if you can't speak well. \nSo, yes, people can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their gender. \nThis is another example.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it less serious to get. Now it is like a traffic ticket. You get in trouble, but not as bad as before. You don't have to go to jail.\n\nPeople worry about the future. They don't want a record for something like this. Even if it is not a big deal now, it can still hurt them later.\n\nBut some people think it costs a lot to arrest people and take them to court. They say it is better to not do this and use the money for other things. Some cities are hurting financially, so they do not want to do this.\n\nOne city that changed the rules is Denver. People there are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. Now the city has more money to spend on things like education and food for people who need it.\n\nSome people are worried that if marijuana is legal, people will smoke it everywhere. They will drive and smoke. This is not good. And some people do not like the idea of marijuana being out in the open.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for driving. Marijuana can also be bad for people's lives. But people react differently to substances. Some people can handle them well. Others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But both marijuana and alcohol have bad effects.",
            "I agree. Here's why: Many things the Catholic Church does are very traditional. They do things the same way for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be flexible to change.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules exactly. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was an Episcopalian too. My mom was a Catholic, but they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. This is not very tolerant.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. I feel like some Catholic rules tell you to do things, but the way the Church practices goes against it. The rules are old-fashioned, but the Church continues to follow them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. If someone wants to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.\n\nPeople who hurt children will do it regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about the child, not the spouse. So, allowing priests to be married would not stop this from happening.",
            "I do not have a strong opinion on this issue. I am not sure if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult topic because it is close to the separation of church and state. It is also hard to define what marriage is without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a special union between two people. Some people think it is a sacrament. Others do not believe in a government definition of marriage. They think the government should not decide what kind of marriage is okay.\n\nIf two people get married, they should have the same rights as other married couples. They should not be treated unfairly. If the government gives tax breaks to married people, it should give them to all married couples, not just some.\n\nThe idea of gay marriage is that two people of the same sex can get married. Some people do not think this is right. But it is not a big enough issue to change the constitution. The constitution should not be changed just to ban gay marriage.\n\nIt is not important enough to make a law that says who can and cannot get married. The government should not decide who is married and who is not.\n\nI do not think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a good idea.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I have many gay friends, but I do not totally agree with that lifestyle. However, I believe it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national decision.\n\nI think a state should decide for itself whether to allow gay marriage. Many states are democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision.\n\nYou chose to live in that state. If you do not agree with the decision, you can move to a different state. I believe homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should be able to decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide what the whole country thinks about gay marriage. I believe it should be up to each state.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I think the president should not decide how each state should behave. He does not live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. President Bush will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nI do not have an opinion about that.",
            "I don't agree with the school officials looking at students' Myspace pages. If you post something on the internet, you know it will be seen by others. This includes school officials. They can still find out what you are doing even if your Myspace page is not under the school's name. They can look at it from their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is okay if they look at Myspace to prevent school shootings. If they can save lives, that is a good thing. School officials have a responsibility to keep students safe.\n\nIt is like when they check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to catch students who are doing something wrong. I think this is an invasion of privacy. But, if they can make the school a better and safer place, it is okay.\n\nEverything on the internet can be seen by others. If you post something on Myspace, it will be there forever. This can hurt you later in life. If you do something wrong, it can be hard to get out of trouble.\n\nSchool officials should not check Myspace just to catch students. But, if they have a reason, it is okay. Like when they make sure the school is safe. This is like when they practice lock downs to be ready for bad things to happen.\n\nThey did this to prepare for something like the Columbine school shooting. They wanted to keep students safe. I think this is what school officials were doing in this case. They were making the school a safer place.",
            "I was for the war in Iraq at first. I thought it was a good idea to go there after nine eleven. But now I am against it. I think we had no plan and were not prepared.\n\nWe went to Iraq because of anger and emotion, not because we thought about the long-term effects. We did not think about what would happen after we arrived. As a result, things did not go well.\n\nThe people in Iraq fight among themselves. They cannot work together. If they fight each other, they cannot fight against us. We went to Iraq to help, but we are not making a difference. We are actually hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They use strong methods and are not interested in making their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nWe went to Iraq looking for revenge. We wanted to punish them for what happened on nine eleven. But we should have thought about the consequences. We should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe cannot change the people in Iraq. They will always be the same. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. When we leave, things will get worse. So, it is better for us to leave now.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. We are not doing enough good to stay in Iraq. We should just leave and stop hurting ourselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are losing interest in the Church. One reason is that the Church is not open to many things. For example, the Church has strong views on gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are not modern. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on these issues. The Church's views are old-fashioned. The Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same thing is true for gay marriage.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God and give their lives to the Church. But people in other jobs have families and other responsibilities. I do not see why priests cannot have these things too.",

They should not be blamed for how they are born.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide. It is not a matter of law or morality. It is just about treating people fairly. Gay people should not be blamed for how they are born. They should be allowed to live their lives like everyone else.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved. It has nothing to do with the country's safety. It is just about treating people fairly. They should not interfere in people's lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family. However, this is not true. It's a different kind of relationship. There are many different aspects to it, and it can't be compared to a traditional marriage.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. However, they are the same thing. \n\nThere are many civil rights that come with marriage, like taxes and health care. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. They're not considered family.\n\nI think this is silly. If you're going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany scientific studies have been done on this issue. They show that gay couples have the same kinds of relationships as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to happiness.\n\nIt's just a relationship. It's the same thing. People get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. Gay couples are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government gives civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in their relationships. People worry about adoption and community issues. They're concerned about how gay couples will affect the community and children.\n\nHowever, this is new and hard to understand. It's hard to say what will happen to children of gay couples. They may be treated badly by their peers or other adults.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. In public schools, they get beaten up. Parents protest to get their children removed from school.\n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not, just like anyone else.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. His views are not necessarily mine. Most of the reasons he gives are moral reasons. However, morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to ignore the morality of other groups and go along with what some religious groups believe. This is hypocritical, especially considering the controversy about the Pledge of Allegiance and \"under God.\"\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not true.\n\nIf people listened to experts and research, the world would be a different place.",
            "This summer I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I think a drug's legality does not mean it has good qualities. So, I think it is good to use marijuana for medical purposes, but not make it available to the public. We use many illegal drugs in pharmacies, like oxycodone and vicodin. They are good and safe when used correctly. If we do not use marijuana because it is not legal, then we are not giving its good qualities a chance. We should permit its use for medical reasons.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either substance, it can be bad for you. I think we should allow marijuana to be used, but we should do it slowly. If we make it legal too fast, people may use it too much. I think we should remove the bad image people have of marijuana. It is not as bad as some other drugs.\n\nIf people think marijuana is not so bad, they may use it responsibly. They can use it for medical reasons, and it might help people feel better.",
            "The Catholic Church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it once was. I grew up attending church every Sunday. I would wear a cute dress and matching shoes. It was a big deal. My friends and I would see each other there on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter mass, just thirty minutes, and people dress more casually. During the summer, some people even wear beach clothes. Families come late, and it is not a big deal.\n\nThe church I attend is changing. I don't know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change is that people dress more casually. It is not as formal as it used to be.\n\nI don't think the church could have prevented the accusations against priests. Some men become pedophiles, even if they are married. It is not the church's rules that cause this. If a man wants to be a priest, it is his choice. There are other religions that allow priests to be married. If they want to be married, they could consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is genetic. People are born with it. It is not something they become. They may try to hide it, but it will come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is shameful.

But that was not true. This made me very upset.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Even Colin Powell, who was a big part of the decision, said he was not sure of the evidence.\n\nI think it is wrong for a president to lie. It is a big mistake. The Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They wanted to do what they wanted, not what the law said.\n\nThe US went to war in Iraq with the intention of taking control. The Secretary of the Treasury wrote a book saying that President Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to remove Saddam Hussein because his father did not like him.

            "I do not think it is right for a state or the government to make marijuana legal. I believe it should be left to the churches. The Constitution says there should be separation of church and state. This is clear. We should not try to enforce laws about something that is against one church's rules if it is not against the rules of another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana use, except in some areas.\n\nThe idea of making marijuana illegal is a matter of church rules, not government rules. The Constitution allows for religious freedom. Some people wanted to change the Constitution to make it clear, but I do not think that is the right thing to do. It would be against what is already written.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. It allows for people to have different beliefs. If we change the Constitution, it would be wrong. It would also be the only amendment that would restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in making marijuana laws. I do not see why the president is pushing for a ban. He is a Catholic and it seems like he is trying to push his own beliefs on others. It is up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government. The president's push for a ban is just his own personal belief.\n\nI do not see how a ban would help the economy.

            "The war in Iraq started in 2003. I do not think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people to make them support the war.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was like the Vietnam War. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war. Many American soldiers died. Removing a country's government is not easy. The government was not prepared for the void of power and chaos that came after the war.\n\nThe US government tried to put a democratic government in place. This was also the goal in Vietnam. But the government should have known that it would be a long and hard process. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made it seem like it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. But it is not easy to implement a new form of government. Democracy was a long struggle in the US too.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. I wanted to let him finish what he started. But now I think the US should not abandon the people of Iraq. We took their government and way of life. We should see it through to the end. But there are many American casualties.\n\nI think the main reason we invaded Iraq was for the oil. We need oil, and Iraq has it. The US government is not honest about its reasons for going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade them.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. It is a personal preference, and it is something that research has shown is often biological, not just a result of how we are raised. \n\nI think it's wrong to deny people rights because of something they can't control. It's not fair or kind. I have always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal and private matter. It's not just about the state or the country, it's about individuals and families. \n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they can't. But they are like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like everyone else. \n\nI think it's wrong when the government tries to decide what marriage means. This is not just about the law, it's about people's lives. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nI've read that some people are born gay. It's a chemical thing in the brain. It's not just about how people are raised. For example, someone who grows up with many sisters and no brothers might be more likely to be gay.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that marriage is not a public event. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without announcing it to the world. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big deal. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't have any other reasons.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. As a resident assistant, I have dealt with this problem before. \n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you write about violence or shootings, people will think you are a threat. The internet is public. If someone sees something bad, they can tell a school official. The school has to act quickly. They cannot ignore a threat. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is serious and what is not. Some people just joke around online. You have to be careful. \n\nIn my school, someone overheard something that sounded serious. They called the school, and we found out who the person was.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe initial purpose was good - to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe father of the president who started the war had a problem with the leader of the country we were fighting. \nI think it's not fair to go to war for personal reasons. \nI believe we achieved our goal in the first few months of the war. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty and illness. \nWe should not spend so much money on a long war. \nThere are many important things we need to fix at home, like roads, schools, and health care. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe goal was good - to bring democracy to a country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty, illness, and schools. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be a long-term problem for us. \nWe have many other problems, like poverty, illness, and roads. \nWe should fix these problems at home, not spend money on a war. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nI think the money could be better spent on things that help our country. \n\nI think that's my opinion.",
            "I have a question about something that happened online. It seems that someone looked at a person's information on the internet and was able to stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nThis person found information on the internet because someone had made it available. They must have been friends with the person who posted the information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you have to think that many people will see them. You can't control who sees your information. So it's good that someone was able to find this information and help.\n\nBut it's also a problem. It's not fair to have one person watching everyone's information all the time. It's like treating some people differently. We can't have someone watching people all the time to make sure they're not doing something bad.\n\nIt's like having someone's job to look at people's information on the internet. That's not fair. But maybe it's okay if someone finds information by accident.\n\nI have a Facebook account, not Myspace. I know that some people can see my information. There are people who want to know things about me. They can find my screen name and talk to me on the internet. It's hard to know who these people are.\n\nYou can put some things on the internet, but you can also be careful. I try not to put too much information on my Facebook. But I also want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that didn't allow students to have Myspace. I don't think that's right. The school can't tell students what they can and can't do on the internet.\n\nThat's my thought on this issue.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it at first. But now it's not important to me anymore. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and around the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population think this. Eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want the US to leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before the US invasion. Now it's even worse. There is no easy way to solve problems in the Middle East. The US and Middle Eastern countries have big cultural differences. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries, but the people there might not want that.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought before invading his country. We made a big mistake. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand - it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. The government has not given a good reason to stay. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I wouldn't mind. But I think we should leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want the US to leave. They're the people we're trying to help. If they say we should go, we should listen. That way, we can't say we were not asked to leave.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but the Iraqis didn't want us to stay. At least we'll be the good guys. Well, not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \nIt's not just for women, though. I think it also depends on the job you're doing. \nWomen often have a harder time getting ahead because of the way society has been raised. \nEven though we are supposed to have equal rights, many people have trouble working for a woman if they are a man. \nThis is because of how things have been for a long time. \nIn many workplaces, women see a job they are qualified for, but are not chosen for it because it's not common for women to be in high positions. \nThe same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \nSociety often looks down on men who stay home with their children. \nThey should be the ones working and making money, right? \nThis can be hard for them because maybe they've always wanted to take care of their children. \nIf they are married, their wife may have a good job and be working. \nBut society doesn't understand this and looks down on men who stay home. \nIn the fashion industry, some people don't take men seriously if they are straight. \nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because men who like fashion often have a different style of life. \nIf a man is in fashion and has a typical life, people may wonder if he really knows about fashion or if he just follows what women like. \nIt depends on the job you're in, but I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States. \nChanging it is hard because society has a set way of thinking. \nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow. \nI think if we keep working at the pace we are now, women will continue to get more opportunities and become more accepted in business. \nMore men are also staying home with their children and being accepted. \nAs people see the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped, they will start to understand them better. \nWe don't need to be too pushy about it, but just show the good qualities of these people. \nIf we do it too fast, people will resist. \nWe're at a good balance now, and change takes time. \n\nI also think people are often discriminated against because of where they're from or how they speak. \nIf you grew up on a farm and didn't learn how to speak well, but you're very smart, you might still be able to get a good job. \nBut other men might look down on you because they think you might not be smart if you can't speak well. \nSo, yes, people can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their gender. \nThis is another example.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it less serious to get. Now it is like a traffic ticket. You get in trouble, but not as bad as before. You don't have to go to jail.\n\nPeople worry about the future. They don't want a record for something like this. Even if it is not a big deal now, it can still hurt them later.\n\nBut some people think it costs a lot to arrest people and take them to court. They say it is better to not do this and use the money for other things. Some cities are hurting financially, so they do not want to do this.\n\nOne city that changed the rules is Denver. People there are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. Now the city has more money to spend on things like education and food for people who need it.\n\nSome people are worried that if marijuana is legal, people will smoke it everywhere. They will drive and smoke. This is not good. And some people do not like the idea of marijuana being out in the open.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for driving. Marijuana can also be bad for people's lives. But people react differently to substances. Some people can handle them well. Others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But both marijuana and alcohol have bad effects.",
            "I agree. Here's why: Many things the Catholic Church does are very traditional. They do things the same way for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be flexible to change.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules exactly. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was an Episcopalian too. My mom was a Catholic, but they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. This is not very tolerant.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. I feel like some Catholic rules tell you to do things, but the way the Church practices goes against it. The rules are old-fashioned, but the Church continues to follow them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. If someone wants to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.\n\nPeople who hurt children will do it regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about the child, not the spouse. So, allowing priests to be married would not stop this from happening.",
            "I do not have a strong opinion on this issue. I am not sure if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult topic because it is close to the separation of church and state. It is also hard to define what marriage is without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a special union between two people. Some people think it is a sacrament. Others do not believe in a government definition of marriage. They think the government should not decide what kind of marriage is okay.\n\nIf two people get married, they should have the same rights as other married couples. They should not be treated unfairly. If the government gives tax breaks to married people, it should give them to all married couples, not just some.\n\nThe idea of gay marriage is that two people of the same sex can get married. Some people do not think this is right. But it is not a big enough issue to change the constitution. The constitution should not be changed just to ban gay marriage.\n\nIt is not important enough to make a law that says who can and cannot get married. The government should not decide who is married and who is not.\n\nI do not think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a good idea.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I have many gay friends, but I do not totally agree with that lifestyle. However, I believe it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national decision.\n\nI think a state should decide for itself whether to allow gay marriage. Many states are democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision.\n\nYou chose to live in that state. If you do not agree with the decision, you can move to a different state. I believe homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should be able to decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide what the whole country thinks about gay marriage. I believe it should be up to each state.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I think the president should not decide how each state should behave. He does not live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. President Bush will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nI do not have an opinion about that.",
            "I don't agree with the school officials looking at students' Myspace pages. If you post something on the internet, you know it will be seen by others. This includes school officials. They can still find out what you are doing even if your Myspace page is not under the school's name. They can look at it from their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is okay if they look at Myspace to prevent school shootings. If they can save lives, that is a good thing. School officials have a responsibility to keep students safe.\n\nIt is like when they check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to catch students who are doing something wrong. I think this is an invasion of privacy. But, if they can make the school a better and safer place, it is okay.\n\nEverything on the internet can be seen by others. If you post something on Myspace, it will be there forever. This can hurt you later in life. If you do something wrong, it can be hard to get out of trouble.\n\nSchool officials should not check Myspace just to catch students. But, if they have a reason, it is okay. Like when they make sure the school is safe. This is like when they practice lock downs to be ready for bad things to happen.\n\nThey did this to prepare for something like the Columbine school shooting. They wanted to keep students safe. I think this is what school officials were doing in this case. They were making the school a safer place.",
            "I was for the war in Iraq at first. I thought it was a good idea to go there after nine eleven. But now I am against it. I think we had no plan and were not prepared.\n\nWe went to Iraq because of anger and emotion, not because we thought about the long-term effects. We did not think about what would happen after we arrived. As a result, things did not go well.\n\nThe people in Iraq fight among themselves. They cannot work together. If they fight each other, they cannot fight against us. We went to Iraq to help, but we are not making a difference. We are actually hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They use strong methods and are not interested in making their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nWe went to Iraq looking for revenge. We wanted to punish them for what happened on nine eleven. But we should have thought about the consequences. We should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe cannot change the people in Iraq. They will always be the same. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. When we leave, things will get worse. So, it is better for us to leave now.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. We are not doing enough good to stay in Iraq. We should just leave and stop hurting ourselves."
