            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changed its views, it might not lose its followers.\n\nSome people do not agree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church is against abortion. If you are for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone else works and has a family life. Priests should be able to do the same.",

But some people are born gay, and that's okay.\n\nI don't think it's right to stop people from marrying who they love.  It's like saying that a man and a woman can get married, but two men or two women can't.  That's not fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue.  It's not a matter of security or moral values.  It's just a personal issue.  People should be free to make their own choices.\n\nThe government should not punish people for who they are.

So, I think making it available to the public is not a good idea. No, I do not think so. But, I think it should be used for medical purposes. This is because just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is good or bad.\n\nMany drugs against the law are used in pharmacies. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are medicines we use all the time. These are controlled substances. But we use them because they are good for people. If we deny the good qualities of marijuana just because it is against the law, that is not fair. We should accept its good qualities.\n\nI do not think marijuana is similar to alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause problems. This is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. If we do this, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is a bad thing, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. It was a special event. Later, I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nNow that I am older, I see that the church has become more casual. They have a shorter service on Sundays. People wear jeans and casual clothes, especially in the summer. Some people even come to church in their beach clothes.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is that people dress more casually. They used to wear nice clothes to church. Now, it is more relaxed.\n\nAs for other things, that is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know about the politics of the church.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic Church of not doing enough to stop priests from doing bad things. They say the church should allow women to be priests or priests to get married. But I do not think this would have stopped the bad things from happening. People who do bad things, like hurting children, are not just because they are priests. It is their choice to do bad things. Some people are married and still hurt children.\n\nI also think that when someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They can choose to be a priest or not. Some other religions allow priests to get married. If someone wants to be married and be a priest, they could choose a different religion.\n\nI think the reason some priests do bad things is because of the way their bodies are made. I think it is a genetic problem. People are born to be a certain way, and getting married will not change that. It might seem like it does not matter, but it is a natural part of who they are. If the church knew about the bad things and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is a serious offense. It goes against the principles of the Constitution. The Bush administration has been trying to limit the power of the Constitution since they were in office.\n\nI believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq.

I think the reason we went to Iraq was because of the attacks on September 11. \n\nWe are still in Iraq, and we are trying to build a democracy. We want to make Iraq like the United States. We also want to get oil from them. But staying in Iraq is causing problems. It makes people there very upset. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build a democracy. This will take a long time.

But I am also worried about the people in Iraq. They have lives and homes, and we have destroyed them. \n\nIf we stay, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will not help them.

            "I disagree with making marijuana legal. It is not right for a state to say it is legal. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is clearly stated and I think trying to control it would be against the Constitution.\n\nI think those who want to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Many Christians and Catholics do not agree with it. But I don't think the government should decide what is allowed and not allowed for churches.\n\nThe separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It allows for religious freedom in the United States. If they made an amendment about it, it would be wrong and go against the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this amendment. It seems like it is because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing a preference for one religion over others.\n\nI think it is up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There is no good reason for an amendment to ban it, except for personal views. I don't see how it will affect the economy or anything else. It might actually help the economy and society.",
            "The war in Iraq did not start well. The US government may not have been honest about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks. However, this was not true.\n\nI am against war. I think the US government made a mistake by starting a war without being prepared for the consequences. The US removed the Iraqi government. However, they did not plan for the aftermath.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. This is very sad. The US government should have known that removing the government and trying to create a new one would be difficult. They should have learned from their past mistakes, like the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government said they would create a democratic government in Iraq. But this has not happened easily. They are still trying to train the Iraqi military and police. It will take a long time to do this.\n\nI think the US government was not honest about the war. They made it seem easy to implement a new government. But it is not easy. Democracy takes time to develop, and there are often struggles. The US government should have been more careful and honest about the war.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. One reason was that I wanted him to finish what he started. But now, it is hard to know if we should stay in Iraq. Many American soldiers have died, and it is not clear if it is worth it.\n\nThe main reason for the war was to make Iraq a democratic country. But we are not doing this in other countries. I think the real reason is the oil. Iraq has a lot of oil, and the US wants to control it.\n\nThe US government also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Countries like North Korea have these weapons, but the US is not attacking them. I think the US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",

You cannot tell them what to take seriously or not.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace or Facebook. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously if there is danger.\n\nTeachers should not make a fake account to friend their students. That is the same thing. I do not friend my residents because I do not want to know what they do. If they post pictures of themselves drinking, I do not want to see it.\n\nIt is not my job to police them. I do not want that connection.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe purpose was good at first. \nIt was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal. \nNow we are fighting just to show our power. \nI think the original reason was questionable. \nIt started with George Bush's father's problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that's good. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that's not good. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I think our goal has changed. \nWe're still fighting just to be fighting. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning.\n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nTheir government will have to take care of themselves soon. \nWe should stop spending billions of dollars on war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty, that we should be spending money on. \nWar is not good for our economy. \nWe should spend money on things like roads, schools and health care.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nSomeone used the internet to find information that stopped a life from being lost. This happened because the person had put the information on Myspace.\n\nIf you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you must be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you accept someone as a friend, you give them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, you should know many people will see it.\n\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that information and stopped a life from being lost.\n\nBut it is hard to say if this is right. We cannot have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent problems. This could be unfair to some students. It is not right to have someone's job just to look at people's profiles.\n\nIt depends on why they were looking at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking randomly? I do not know.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but I know it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a TV show about someone who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute. Some people in my classes know my screen name and I do not recognize them. They IM me and they know my interests, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It is hard to limit what I put on the internet because I want to communicate with my friends.\n\nBut at the same time, I am worried about who can see what I put on the internet. I only accept people I know. However, you never know who can look at what you put on the internet.\n\nI heard that my roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. I do not know if that is a privacy issue, but I am not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students they could not have Myspace.\n\nThat is my only other thought on this subject.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the Iraq War. I do not like talking about it because I do not want to be like everyone else. But I think it is not important anymore. Most people think it was a bad idea. The US government did not agree. They do not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. In the US, Iraq, and around the world, most people think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of the Iraqis think so. Most US soldiers in Iraq also think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nI do not know what to say about this. The situation in Iraq is very difficult. It was already a problem before we came. Now it is even worse. We cannot just leave or stay without causing more problems.\n\nI think the main problem is the difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. We think we can bring democracy, but the people of Iraq may not want it. We should think about the pros and cons before making a decision. We went to Iraq and now it is a disaster.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. If we want to leave slowly, that's okay. But I do not think we should stay any longer than we have to. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year. We should listen to them.\n\nIf something goes wrong after we leave, we can say we gave them a chance to make their own decisions. If we stay and make things worse, we will not be seen as good guys. But we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.  It's not just about women, but also about the kind of work you do.\n\nFor overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we say there is equality, it's hard for people to work under a woman. This is because of how society was raised for so long.\n\nMany times, women see a job they can do and have the qualifications for it. But maybe the board won't promote them to that position because historically, women aren't in powerful business jobs.\n\nMen also face discrimination in certain fields, like fashion. It's rare to have a male parent staying at home. Society often looks down on this because they think men should be working and making money.\n\nThis can be hard on men who want to stay home with their children. Perhaps the wife has a better job and it works out fine, but society still looks down on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight. This might be because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. If a man is in fashion and has a typical style, people might wonder if he really knows what fashion is for women.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you do, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. If we keep working at our current pace, I think we can make progress. Women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are becoming stay-at-home dads.\n\nAs people learn more about others, they become more accepting. To promote this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against. If we force change, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, and change is happening slowly.\n\nI'm not sure what else we can do that isn't already being done. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they're from. If someone grows up on a farm and doesn't have the best grammar, but is intelligent and works their way up to a CEO job, other men might look down on them.\n\nSo, people can be discriminated against based on gender, where they're from, and other things. I think this is another example.",
            "The government in California changed the law about marijuana. Now, it is not a big crime to have some marijuana. You can get a ticket instead of going to jail. This is called decriminalization.\n\nThis means that people who are caught with marijuana will not have to go to jail. They will not have to pay a lot of money for fines and lawyers. This can save a lot of money for the city.\n\nSome people think this is a good idea. They say it will help cities that are running out of money. They can use the money they save to help people.\n\nOne city in Colorado, Denver, made this change. Now they have more money to help people. They can use it for schools, for old people, and for people who do not have enough to eat.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this change. Some people think marijuana should not be allowed. They think it is bad for people to use it.\n\nIf marijuana is made legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes. People could smoke it anywhere. This could be a problem because some people drive cars while smoking marijuana. It could be bad for them.\n\nSome people think alcohol is worse than marijuana. Alcohol can hurt a person's ability to drive. Marijuana can also hurt a person's ability to make good decisions.\n\nBut people are different. How they react to marijuana is different. Some people can use it and be fine. Others cannot use it at all.\n\nSo, it is hard to say if marijuana is good or bad. It depends on the person.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nA lot of the things they do are traditional. \nLike they have done the same things for a long time. \nAnd it's good to be rooted in tradition. \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics think they need to go to church every week. \nAnd they are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules. \nAnd it doesn't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nIt also doesn't accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey wouldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not really being tolerant of other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it's hypocritical to say love others and not accept them. \nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things. \nBut the way the church practices goes against it. \nBecause it's old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think this would make a difference. \nI personally think it would be good to allow priests to marry. \nBut I don't think this would stop them from acting inappropriately with children. \nBecause it's different from being married to an adult. \nSo if you're going to do something bad, you probably will do it anyway. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these bad things from happening. \nI think they would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. But I think this is a very difficult problem to solve. It is hard to separate the government from the church. And it is hard to define marriage without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is considered a sacred thing by many people. If it is a marriage, then the government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is. It should just look at it as a union between two people.\n\nIf two people are in a union, they should be treated the same as everyone else. The government should not care about what kind of union it is.\n\nI think if all the states agree on this issue, it should be made a law across the country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is a big problem for some people, but it is not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution just to define marriage. It should not be changed to take away someone's right to get married.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a bit confusing for me. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, some are Republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same chances as heterosexuals. Each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He should not make all states follow his ideas. I do not agree with his ban on gay marriage. I think each state should decide.\n\nI think some things should be left to each state. President Bush will not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state should work. Some things should be decided by each state, not the president. He will be out of office soon. A new president may change the law on gay marriage. It should be up to each state.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ideas on this.",
            "I do not agree with this. First, Myspace is a public thing. If you post something on the internet, you must be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. Even if the post is not made under the school's name, they can still find it. They can look at it in their homes.\n\nIn a situation like a school shooting, I think it is okay for school officials to search for information on the internet. If it helps keep students safe, then it is a good thing. It is a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nIf school officials look at a student's Myspace page just to see if they are doing something they should not, that is an invasion of privacy. But if they are trying to make the school a safer place, then I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is a public thing, and if you do something on the internet, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something bad about someone, you should not put it on an email. You never know who might see it.\n\nIf you do something wrong when you are a student, it can come back to haunt you when you are older. Once something is on the internet, it is hard to get rid of it. You can get in trouble for things you did a long time ago.\n\nIf school officials have a good reason to look at a student's Myspace page, then it is okay. But they should not just look at it to catch students. They should only look at it if it will make the school a safer place.\n\nWhen parents send their children to school, they want them to be safe. That is why the school officials looked at the Myspace page. They wanted to make sure the school was safe, like they do with lockdown drills.\n\nThe school officials did what was necessary to keep students safe. They looked at the Myspace page to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. We practiced lockdown drills in my school to make sure we were safe.\n\nThat is all I have to say on this.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was for it at first because of what happened on 9/11. I felt we needed to strike back. But as time went on, I realized we were not prepared. We didn't have a clear plan.\n\nI think we made things worse. We went to war without thinking about the future. We just acted out of emotion and anger. This led to more problems.\n\nI don't think we should be in Iraq. They are fighting among themselves. As long as they are fighting each other, they won't attack us.\n\nI don't care about what happens in Iraq. I don't think they are able to work together. They are not like us. War is very different for them.\n\nI think we just wanted revenge after 9/11. President Bush said we needed to go to war with Iraq. He declared war, but I think he didn't have a clear plan.\n\nWe should have left Iraq alone. We can't stay there forever. If we leave, things will get worse. We are hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough. We should go home and let them deal with their problems. We can't change them. They will always be the way they are."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changed its views, it might not lose its followers.\n\nSome people do not agree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church is against abortion. If you are for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone else works and has a family life. Priests should be able to do the same.",

But some people are born gay, and that's okay.\n\nI don't think it's right to stop people from marrying who they love.  It's like saying that a man and a woman can get married, but two men or two women can't.  That's not fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue.  It's not a matter of security or moral values.  It's just a personal issue.  People should be free to make their own choices.\n\nThe government should not punish people for who they are.

So, I think making it available to the public is not a good idea. No, I do not think so. But, I think it should be used for medical purposes. This is because just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is good or bad.\n\nMany drugs against the law are used in pharmacies. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are medicines we use all the time. These are controlled substances. But we use them because they are good for people. If we deny the good qualities of marijuana just because it is against the law, that is not fair. We should accept its good qualities.\n\nI do not think marijuana is similar to alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause problems. This is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. If we do this, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is a bad thing, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. It was a special event. Later, I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nNow that I am older, I see that the church has become more casual. They have a shorter service on Sundays. People wear jeans and casual clothes, especially in the summer. Some people even come to church in their beach clothes.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is that people dress more casually. They used to wear nice clothes to church. Now, it is more relaxed.\n\nAs for other things, that is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know about the politics of the church.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic Church of not doing enough to stop priests from doing bad things. They say the church should allow women to be priests or priests to get married. But I do not think this would have stopped the bad things from happening. People who do bad things, like hurting children, are not just because they are priests. It is their choice to do bad things. Some people are married and still hurt children.\n\nI also think that when someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They can choose to be a priest or not. Some other religions allow priests to get married. If someone wants to be married and be a priest, they could choose a different religion.\n\nI think the reason some priests do bad things is because of the way their bodies are made. I think it is a genetic problem. People are born to be a certain way, and getting married will not change that. It might seem like it does not matter, but it is a natural part of who they are. If the church knew about the bad things and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is a serious offense. It goes against the principles of the Constitution. The Bush administration has been trying to limit the power of the Constitution since they were in office.\n\nI believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq.

I think the reason we went to Iraq was because of the attacks on September 11. \n\nWe are still in Iraq, and we are trying to build a democracy. We want to make Iraq like the United States. We also want to get oil from them. But staying in Iraq is causing problems. It makes people there very upset. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build a democracy. This will take a long time.

But I am also worried about the people in Iraq. They have lives and homes, and we have destroyed them. \n\nIf we stay, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will not help them.

            "I disagree with making marijuana legal. It is not right for a state to say it is legal. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is clearly stated and I think trying to control it would be against the Constitution.\n\nI think those who want to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Many Christians and Catholics do not agree with it. But I don't think the government should decide what is allowed and not allowed for churches.\n\nThe separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It allows for religious freedom in the United States. If they made an amendment about it, it would be wrong and go against the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this amendment. It seems like it is because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing a preference for one religion over others.\n\nI think it is up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There is no good reason for an amendment to ban it, except for personal views. I don't see how it will affect the economy or anything else. It might actually help the economy and society.",
            "The war in Iraq did not start well. The US government may not have been honest about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks. However, this was not true.\n\nI am against war. I think the US government made a mistake by starting a war without being prepared for the consequences. The US removed the Iraqi government. However, they did not plan for the aftermath.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. This is very sad. The US government should have known that removing the government and trying to create a new one would be difficult. They should have learned from their past mistakes, like the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government said they would create a democratic government in Iraq. But this has not happened easily. They are still trying to train the Iraqi military and police. It will take a long time to do this.\n\nI think the US government was not honest about the war. They made it seem easy to implement a new government. But it is not easy. Democracy takes time to develop, and there are often struggles. The US government should have been more careful and honest about the war.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. One reason was that I wanted him to finish what he started. But now, it is hard to know if we should stay in Iraq. Many American soldiers have died, and it is not clear if it is worth it.\n\nThe main reason for the war was to make Iraq a democratic country. But we are not doing this in other countries. I think the real reason is the oil. Iraq has a lot of oil, and the US wants to control it.\n\nThe US government also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Countries like North Korea have these weapons, but the US is not attacking them. I think the US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",

You cannot tell them what to take seriously or not.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace or Facebook. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously if there is danger.\n\nTeachers should not make a fake account to friend their students. That is the same thing. I do not friend my residents because I do not want to know what they do. If they post pictures of themselves drinking, I do not want to see it.\n\nIt is not my job to police them. I do not want that connection.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe purpose was good at first. \nIt was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal. \nNow we are fighting just to show our power. \nI think the original reason was questionable. \nIt started with George Bush's father's problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that's good. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that's not good. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I think our goal has changed. \nWe're still fighting just to be fighting. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning.\n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nTheir government will have to take care of themselves soon. \nWe should stop spending billions of dollars on war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty, that we should be spending money on. \nWar is not good for our economy. \nWe should spend money on things like roads, schools and health care.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nSomeone used the internet to find information that stopped a life from being lost. This happened because the person had put the information on Myspace.\n\nIf you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you must be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you accept someone as a friend, you give them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, you should know many people will see it.\n\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that information and stopped a life from being lost.\n\nBut it is hard to say if this is right. We cannot have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent problems. This could be unfair to some students. It is not right to have someone's job just to look at people's profiles.\n\nIt depends on why they were looking at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking randomly? I do not know.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but I know it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a TV show about someone who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute. Some people in my classes know my screen name and I do not recognize them. They IM me and they know my interests, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It is hard to limit what I put on the internet because I want to communicate with my friends.\n\nBut at the same time, I am worried about who can see what I put on the internet. I only accept people I know. However, you never know who can look at what you put on the internet.\n\nI heard that my roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. I do not know if that is a privacy issue, but I am not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students they could not have Myspace.\n\nThat is my only other thought on this subject.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the Iraq War. I do not like talking about it because I do not want to be like everyone else. But I think it is not important anymore. Most people think it was a bad idea. The US government did not agree. They do not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. In the US, Iraq, and around the world, most people think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of the Iraqis think so. Most US soldiers in Iraq also think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nI do not know what to say about this. The situation in Iraq is very difficult. It was already a problem before we came. Now it is even worse. We cannot just leave or stay without causing more problems.\n\nI think the main problem is the difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. We think we can bring democracy, but the people of Iraq may not want it. We should think about the pros and cons before making a decision. We went to Iraq and now it is a disaster.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. If we want to leave slowly, that's okay. But I do not think we should stay any longer than we have to. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year. We should listen to them.\n\nIf something goes wrong after we leave, we can say we gave them a chance to make their own decisions. If we stay and make things worse, we will not be seen as good guys. But we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.  It's not just about women, but also about the kind of work you do.\n\nFor overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we say there is equality, it's hard for people to work under a woman. This is because of how society was raised for so long.\n\nMany times, women see a job they can do and have the qualifications for it. But maybe the board won't promote them to that position because historically, women aren't in powerful business jobs.\n\nMen also face discrimination in certain fields, like fashion. It's rare to have a male parent staying at home. Society often looks down on this because they think men should be working and making money.\n\nThis can be hard on men who want to stay home with their children. Perhaps the wife has a better job and it works out fine, but society still looks down on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight. This might be because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. If a man is in fashion and has a typical style, people might wonder if he really knows what fashion is for women.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you do, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. If we keep working at our current pace, I think we can make progress. Women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are becoming stay-at-home dads.\n\nAs people learn more about others, they become more accepting. To promote this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against. If we force change, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, and change is happening slowly.\n\nI'm not sure what else we can do that isn't already being done. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they're from. If someone grows up on a farm and doesn't have the best grammar, but is intelligent and works their way up to a CEO job, other men might look down on them.\n\nSo, people can be discriminated against based on gender, where they're from, and other things. I think this is another example.",
            "The government in California changed the law about marijuana. Now, it is not a big crime to have some marijuana. You can get a ticket instead of going to jail. This is called decriminalization.\n\nThis means that people who are caught with marijuana will not have to go to jail. They will not have to pay a lot of money for fines and lawyers. This can save a lot of money for the city.\n\nSome people think this is a good idea. They say it will help cities that are running out of money. They can use the money they save to help people.\n\nOne city in Colorado, Denver, made this change. Now they have more money to help people. They can use it for schools, for old people, and for people who do not have enough to eat.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this change. Some people think marijuana should not be allowed. They think it is bad for people to use it.\n\nIf marijuana is made legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes. People could smoke it anywhere. This could be a problem because some people drive cars while smoking marijuana. It could be bad for them.\n\nSome people think alcohol is worse than marijuana. Alcohol can hurt a person's ability to drive. Marijuana can also hurt a person's ability to make good decisions.\n\nBut people are different. How they react to marijuana is different. Some people can use it and be fine. Others cannot use it at all.\n\nSo, it is hard to say if marijuana is good or bad. It depends on the person.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nA lot of the things they do are traditional. \nLike they have done the same things for a long time. \nAnd it's good to be rooted in tradition. \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics think they need to go to church every week. \nAnd they are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules. \nAnd it doesn't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nIt also doesn't accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey wouldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not really being tolerant of other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it's hypocritical to say love others and not accept them. \nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things. \nBut the way the church practices goes against it. \nBecause it's old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think this would make a difference. \nI personally think it would be good to allow priests to marry. \nBut I don't think this would stop them from acting inappropriately with children. \nBecause it's different from being married to an adult. \nSo if you're going to do something bad, you probably will do it anyway. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these bad things from happening. \nI think they would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. But I think this is a very difficult problem to solve. It is hard to separate the government from the church. And it is hard to define marriage without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is considered a sacred thing by many people. If it is a marriage, then the government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is. It should just look at it as a union between two people.\n\nIf two people are in a union, they should be treated the same as everyone else. The government should not care about what kind of union it is.\n\nI think if all the states agree on this issue, it should be made a law across the country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is a big problem for some people, but it is not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution just to define marriage. It should not be changed to take away someone's right to get married.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a bit confusing for me. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, some are Republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same chances as heterosexuals. Each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He should not make all states follow his ideas. I do not agree with his ban on gay marriage. I think each state should decide.\n\nI think some things should be left to each state. President Bush will not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state should work. Some things should be decided by each state, not the president. He will be out of office soon. A new president may change the law on gay marriage. It should be up to each state.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ideas on this.",
            "I do not agree with this. First, Myspace is a public thing. If you post something on the internet, you must be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. Even if the post is not made under the school's name, they can still find it. They can look at it in their homes.\n\nIn a situation like a school shooting, I think it is okay for school officials to search for information on the internet. If it helps keep students safe, then it is a good thing. It is a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nIf school officials look at a student's Myspace page just to see if they are doing something they should not, that is an invasion of privacy. But if they are trying to make the school a safer place, then I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is a public thing, and if you do something on the internet, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something bad about someone, you should not put it on an email. You never know who might see it.\n\nIf you do something wrong when you are a student, it can come back to haunt you when you are older. Once something is on the internet, it is hard to get rid of it. You can get in trouble for things you did a long time ago.\n\nIf school officials have a good reason to look at a student's Myspace page, then it is okay. But they should not just look at it to catch students. They should only look at it if it will make the school a safer place.\n\nWhen parents send their children to school, they want them to be safe. That is why the school officials looked at the Myspace page. They wanted to make sure the school was safe, like they do with lockdown drills.\n\nThe school officials did what was necessary to keep students safe. They looked at the Myspace page to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. We practiced lockdown drills in my school to make sure we were safe.\n\nThat is all I have to say on this.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was for it at first because of what happened on 9/11. I felt we needed to strike back. But as time went on, I realized we were not prepared. We didn't have a clear plan.\n\nI think we made things worse. We went to war without thinking about the future. We just acted out of emotion and anger. This led to more problems.\n\nI don't think we should be in Iraq. They are fighting among themselves. As long as they are fighting each other, they won't attack us.\n\nI don't care about what happens in Iraq. I don't think they are able to work together. They are not like us. War is very different for them.\n\nI think we just wanted revenge after 9/11. President Bush said we needed to go to war with Iraq. He declared war, but I think he didn't have a clear plan.\n\nWe should have left Iraq alone. We can't stay there forever. If we leave, things will get worse. We are hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough. We should go home and let them deal with their problems. We can't change them. They will always be the way they are."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changed its views, it might not lose its followers.\n\nSome people do not agree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church is against abortion. If you are for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone else works and has a family life. Priests should be able to do the same.",

But some people are born gay, and that's okay.\n\nI don't think it's right to stop people from marrying who they love.  It's like saying that a man and a woman can get married, but two men or two women can't.  That's not fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue.  It's not a matter of security or moral values.  It's just a personal issue.  People should be free to make their own choices.\n\nThe government should not punish people for who they are.

So, I think making it available to the public is not a good idea. No, I do not think so. But, I think it should be used for medical purposes. This is because just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is good or bad.\n\nMany drugs against the law are used in pharmacies. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are medicines we use all the time. These are controlled substances. But we use them because they are good for people. If we deny the good qualities of marijuana just because it is against the law, that is not fair. We should accept its good qualities.\n\nI do not think marijuana is similar to alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause problems. This is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. If we do this, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is a bad thing, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. It was a special event. Later, I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nNow that I am older, I see that the church has become more casual. They have a shorter service on Sundays. People wear jeans and casual clothes, especially in the summer. Some people even come to church in their beach clothes.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is that people dress more casually. They used to wear nice clothes to church. Now, it is more relaxed.\n\nAs for other things, that is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know about the politics of the church.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic Church of not doing enough to stop priests from doing bad things. They say the church should allow women to be priests or priests to get married. But I do not think this would have stopped the bad things from happening. People who do bad things, like hurting children, are not just because they are priests. It is their choice to do bad things. Some people are married and still hurt children.\n\nI also think that when someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They can choose to be a priest or not. Some other religions allow priests to get married. If someone wants to be married and be a priest, they could choose a different religion.\n\nI think the reason some priests do bad things is because of the way their bodies are made. I think it is a genetic problem. People are born to be a certain way, and getting married will not change that. It might seem like it does not matter, but it is a natural part of who they are. If the church knew about the bad things and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is a serious offense. It goes against the principles of the Constitution. The Bush administration has been trying to limit the power of the Constitution since they were in office.\n\nI believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq.

I think the reason we went to Iraq was because of the attacks on September 11. \n\nWe are still in Iraq, and we are trying to build a democracy. We want to make Iraq like the United States. We also want to get oil from them. But staying in Iraq is causing problems. It makes people there very upset. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build a democracy. This will take a long time.

But I am also worried about the people in Iraq. They have lives and homes, and we have destroyed them. \n\nIf we stay, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will not help them.

            "I disagree with making marijuana legal. It is not right for a state to say it is legal. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is clearly stated and I think trying to control it would be against the Constitution.\n\nI think those who want to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Many Christians and Catholics do not agree with it. But I don't think the government should decide what is allowed and not allowed for churches.\n\nThe separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It allows for religious freedom in the United States. If they made an amendment about it, it would be wrong and go against the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this amendment. It seems like it is because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing a preference for one religion over others.\n\nI think it is up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There is no good reason for an amendment to ban it, except for personal views. I don't see how it will affect the economy or anything else. It might actually help the economy and society.",
            "The war in Iraq did not start well. The US government may not have been honest about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks. However, this was not true.\n\nI am against war. I think the US government made a mistake by starting a war without being prepared for the consequences. The US removed the Iraqi government. However, they did not plan for the aftermath.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. This is very sad. The US government should have known that removing the government and trying to create a new one would be difficult. They should have learned from their past mistakes, like the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government said they would create a democratic government in Iraq. But this has not happened easily. They are still trying to train the Iraqi military and police. It will take a long time to do this.\n\nI think the US government was not honest about the war. They made it seem easy to implement a new government. But it is not easy. Democracy takes time to develop, and there are often struggles. The US government should have been more careful and honest about the war.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. One reason was that I wanted him to finish what he started. But now, it is hard to know if we should stay in Iraq. Many American soldiers have died, and it is not clear if it is worth it.\n\nThe main reason for the war was to make Iraq a democratic country. But we are not doing this in other countries. I think the real reason is the oil. Iraq has a lot of oil, and the US wants to control it.\n\nThe US government also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Countries like North Korea have these weapons, but the US is not attacking them. I think the US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",

You cannot tell them what to take seriously or not.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace or Facebook. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously if there is danger.\n\nTeachers should not make a fake account to friend their students. That is the same thing. I do not friend my residents because I do not want to know what they do. If they post pictures of themselves drinking, I do not want to see it.\n\nIt is not my job to police them. I do not want that connection.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe purpose was good at first. \nIt was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal. \nNow we are fighting just to show our power. \nI think the original reason was questionable. \nIt started with George Bush's father's problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that's good. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that's not good. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I think our goal has changed. \nWe're still fighting just to be fighting. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning.\n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nTheir government will have to take care of themselves soon. \nWe should stop spending billions of dollars on war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty, that we should be spending money on. \nWar is not good for our economy. \nWe should spend money on things like roads, schools and health care.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nSomeone used the internet to find information that stopped a life from being lost. This happened because the person had put the information on Myspace.\n\nIf you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you must be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you accept someone as a friend, you give them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, you should know many people will see it.\n\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that information and stopped a life from being lost.\n\nBut it is hard to say if this is right. We cannot have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent problems. This could be unfair to some students. It is not right to have someone's job just to look at people's profiles.\n\nIt depends on why they were looking at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking randomly? I do not know.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but I know it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a TV show about someone who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute. Some people in my classes know my screen name and I do not recognize them. They IM me and they know my interests, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It is hard to limit what I put on the internet because I want to communicate with my friends.\n\nBut at the same time, I am worried about who can see what I put on the internet. I only accept people I know. However, you never know who can look at what you put on the internet.\n\nI heard that my roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. I do not know if that is a privacy issue, but I am not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students they could not have Myspace.\n\nThat is my only other thought on this subject.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the Iraq War. I do not like talking about it because I do not want to be like everyone else. But I think it is not important anymore. Most people think it was a bad idea. The US government did not agree. They do not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. In the US, Iraq, and around the world, most people think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of the Iraqis think so. Most US soldiers in Iraq also think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nI do not know what to say about this. The situation in Iraq is very difficult. It was already a problem before we came. Now it is even worse. We cannot just leave or stay without causing more problems.\n\nI think the main problem is the difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. We think we can bring democracy, but the people of Iraq may not want it. We should think about the pros and cons before making a decision. We went to Iraq and now it is a disaster.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. If we want to leave slowly, that's okay. But I do not think we should stay any longer than we have to. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year. We should listen to them.\n\nIf something goes wrong after we leave, we can say we gave them a chance to make their own decisions. If we stay and make things worse, we will not be seen as good guys. But we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.  It's not just about women, but also about the kind of work you do.\n\nFor overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we say there is equality, it's hard for people to work under a woman. This is because of how society was raised for so long.\n\nMany times, women see a job they can do and have the qualifications for it. But maybe the board won't promote them to that position because historically, women aren't in powerful business jobs.\n\nMen also face discrimination in certain fields, like fashion. It's rare to have a male parent staying at home. Society often looks down on this because they think men should be working and making money.\n\nThis can be hard on men who want to stay home with their children. Perhaps the wife has a better job and it works out fine, but society still looks down on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight. This might be because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. If a man is in fashion and has a typical style, people might wonder if he really knows what fashion is for women.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you do, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. If we keep working at our current pace, I think we can make progress. Women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are becoming stay-at-home dads.\n\nAs people learn more about others, they become more accepting. To promote this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against. If we force change, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, and change is happening slowly.\n\nI'm not sure what else we can do that isn't already being done. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they're from. If someone grows up on a farm and doesn't have the best grammar, but is intelligent and works their way up to a CEO job, other men might look down on them.\n\nSo, people can be discriminated against based on gender, where they're from, and other things. I think this is another example.",
            "The government in California changed the law about marijuana. Now, it is not a big crime to have some marijuana. You can get a ticket instead of going to jail. This is called decriminalization.\n\nThis means that people who are caught with marijuana will not have to go to jail. They will not have to pay a lot of money for fines and lawyers. This can save a lot of money for the city.\n\nSome people think this is a good idea. They say it will help cities that are running out of money. They can use the money they save to help people.\n\nOne city in Colorado, Denver, made this change. Now they have more money to help people. They can use it for schools, for old people, and for people who do not have enough to eat.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this change. Some people think marijuana should not be allowed. They think it is bad for people to use it.\n\nIf marijuana is made legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes. People could smoke it anywhere. This could be a problem because some people drive cars while smoking marijuana. It could be bad for them.\n\nSome people think alcohol is worse than marijuana. Alcohol can hurt a person's ability to drive. Marijuana can also hurt a person's ability to make good decisions.\n\nBut people are different. How they react to marijuana is different. Some people can use it and be fine. Others cannot use it at all.\n\nSo, it is hard to say if marijuana is good or bad. It depends on the person.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nA lot of the things they do are traditional. \nLike they have done the same things for a long time. \nAnd it's good to be rooted in tradition. \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics think they need to go to church every week. \nAnd they are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules. \nAnd it doesn't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nIt also doesn't accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey wouldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not really being tolerant of other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it's hypocritical to say love others and not accept them. \nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things. \nBut the way the church practices goes against it. \nBecause it's old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think this would make a difference. \nI personally think it would be good to allow priests to marry. \nBut I don't think this would stop them from acting inappropriately with children. \nBecause it's different from being married to an adult. \nSo if you're going to do something bad, you probably will do it anyway. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these bad things from happening. \nI think they would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. But I think this is a very difficult problem to solve. It is hard to separate the government from the church. And it is hard to define marriage without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is considered a sacred thing by many people. If it is a marriage, then the government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is. It should just look at it as a union between two people.\n\nIf two people are in a union, they should be treated the same as everyone else. The government should not care about what kind of union it is.\n\nI think if all the states agree on this issue, it should be made a law across the country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is a big problem for some people, but it is not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution just to define marriage. It should not be changed to take away someone's right to get married.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a bit confusing for me. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, some are Republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same chances as heterosexuals. Each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He should not make all states follow his ideas. I do not agree with his ban on gay marriage. I think each state should decide.\n\nI think some things should be left to each state. President Bush will not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state should work. Some things should be decided by each state, not the president. He will be out of office soon. A new president may change the law on gay marriage. It should be up to each state.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ideas on this.",
            "I do not agree with this. First, Myspace is a public thing. If you post something on the internet, you must be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. Even if the post is not made under the school's name, they can still find it. They can look at it in their homes.\n\nIn a situation like a school shooting, I think it is okay for school officials to search for information on the internet. If it helps keep students safe, then it is a good thing. It is a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nIf school officials look at a student's Myspace page just to see if they are doing something they should not, that is an invasion of privacy. But if they are trying to make the school a safer place, then I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is a public thing, and if you do something on the internet, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something bad about someone, you should not put it on an email. You never know who might see it.\n\nIf you do something wrong when you are a student, it can come back to haunt you when you are older. Once something is on the internet, it is hard to get rid of it. You can get in trouble for things you did a long time ago.\n\nIf school officials have a good reason to look at a student's Myspace page, then it is okay. But they should not just look at it to catch students. They should only look at it if it will make the school a safer place.\n\nWhen parents send their children to school, they want them to be safe. That is why the school officials looked at the Myspace page. They wanted to make sure the school was safe, like they do with lockdown drills.\n\nThe school officials did what was necessary to keep students safe. They looked at the Myspace page to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. We practiced lockdown drills in my school to make sure we were safe.\n\nThat is all I have to say on this.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was for it at first because of what happened on 9/11. I felt we needed to strike back. But as time went on, I realized we were not prepared. We didn't have a clear plan.\n\nI think we made things worse. We went to war without thinking about the future. We just acted out of emotion and anger. This led to more problems.\n\nI don't think we should be in Iraq. They are fighting among themselves. As long as they are fighting each other, they won't attack us.\n\nI don't care about what happens in Iraq. I don't think they are able to work together. They are not like us. War is very different for them.\n\nI think we just wanted revenge after 9/11. President Bush said we needed to go to war with Iraq. He declared war, but I think he didn't have a clear plan.\n\nWe should have left Iraq alone. We can't stay there forever. If we leave, things will get worse. We are hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough. We should go home and let them deal with their problems. We can't change them. They will always be the way they are."
