            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changes its views, it will not lose its followers.\n\nSome people are against the Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not allow women to be priests and priests cannot be married. Many people think this is unfair. They believe everyone should have their own family and life outside of their job.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but they do not need a family. However, this is not true for everyone else. Most people have jobs and families. They must balance work and family life. Priests should be able to do the same. \n\nThe Church needs to be more open-minded and accept different views. This will help it keep its followers. The Church should not be against things that many people support, like gay marriage and birth control.\n\nIf the Church allows priests to be married and have families, it might not have had some problems. However, it is hard to know for sure. The Church's rules are very old and do not fit with modern society.\n\nIn the end, the Church should be more accepting of different views and allow priests to be married and have families.

It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but they are the same thing.\n\nGay couples have many of the same rights as others. They should be able to own property and get medical help when they are sick. But now, they can't be with their partner in the hospital.\n\nThis is not fair. A lot of scientific studies have been done on gay couples and they are just like other couples. They have the same things that make a relationship successful.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to let gay couples get married. They think it's against their religion. But the government should not be involved in church business. If a gay couple wants a marriage certificate, that's all they are asking for.\n\nJust like the civil rights movement, this is about being separate but equal. Gay couples are the same as others in many ways.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how it will affect the community. But this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They can be parents just like anyone else.\n\nChildren of gay couples are just like other children. They are influenced by their parents, but their parents' sexual orientation does not affect their parenting skills.\n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not right.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage. He thinks it's against his religion. But his views are not the only ones that matter. Morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to enforce one group's morality on the whole country. The government should be fair and equal for everyone.\n\nSome people believe that gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just what our friends and neighbors think. If we do, we will see the world in a different way.",

I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. After I moved to a private school, I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend church together.\n\nNow, as I've grown older, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter service, thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some families come to church in beach clothes. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is in the church I attend. I don't know much about the church's politics, but this is my experience.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic church of not doing enough to stop priests who commit pedophilia. People think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to get married, these problems might have been avoided.\n\nI don't think this would have made a difference. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's the person, not the rules that cause the problem. When someone decides to become a priest, it's their choice. There are other religions that allow priests to get married, so if they want to get married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with it, not made that way through upbringing. You can't change it by getting married. It may come out eventually. I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.\n\nI don't have other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

Before we invaded Iraq, they said the war was about the September 11th terrorist attacks. But in reality, the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people after the attack to make the war seem necessary.\n\nI am against war and this one was no exception. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War in some ways. Both were long and difficult. The US government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war in Iraq. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government and tried to put in a new one. But this was a hard and long process.\n\nI do not think the US government was prepared for the problems it would face in Iraq. They should have learned from past mistakes.

They made it seem like it would be an easy thing to do.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do now. We have been in Iraq for a long time and it is hard to leave. We took away their government and their way of life. But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are still dying. The US government should have thought more about the consequences of going to war.\n\nI think the main reason for invading Iraq was to control their oil. This is one reason why we are not helping other countries become democratic.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq. But this does not seem likely.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal choice and not something that should be limited by laws. Many studies show that being gay is not a choice, but a biological fact. It is not something a person can control.\n\nI do not think politics and government should interfere with this issue. It is a personal and private matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they cannot be. However, they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. Marriage is a personal relationship between two people, not something that the government should define.\n\nStudies have shown that being gay is often a result of a chemical difference in the brain. It is something a person is born with and not something they choose. This is different from growing up in a certain way or being raised in a certain environment.\n\nIf two people, a man and a woman, want to get married, they can do so privately without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something that is made public.\n\nI am not for or against anything else about gay marriage.

They cannot ignore it. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. They may say things they do not mean. We had a situation at school like this. It was an experiment for a class. But it could be serious. Recently, something happened because someone overheard a student saying something in school.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe original goal was good, to help another country have democracy. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal a long time ago. \nNow we are fighting just to show we are strong. \nI don't think the reasons were good from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf our goal was to help a country without a fair government, that would have been good. \nBut I think we have been fighting for too long. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut now we have been fighting for years. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would have been a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think that is our reason anymore. \nIt seems we are fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war should end. \nTheir government should take care of itself. \nWe are spending a lot of money on the war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty and poor roads. \nWe should spend money on those things. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \n\nWe spend billions of dollars on the war. \nWe have many problems at home that need money. \nThings like schools, roads and health care need money. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important. \n\nThat's my opinion.",
            "Do you think it is right for schools to prevent students from having Myspace accounts? This is a question I want to ask.\n\nI was thinking about this because someone found out about something on the internet. They looked at your Myspace and found out that you were in trouble. They were able to help prevent a bad thing from happening. I think this is good.\n\nBut then I started thinking, how do they know what to look for? If they are just looking at everyone's Myspace, it might not be fair. They might be looking at the wrong people. And it might be like profiling. They might be looking for bad people, but they might not be fair.\n\nI don't think it is right for someone to have a job to look at everyone's Myspace all day. But I also think it is good that someone was able to help prevent a bad thing from happening.\n\nI have a Facebook, but I don't have a Myspace. But I know that there are bad people who can see things about me on the internet. I saw a TV show about this. A man was trying to show how easy it is to get information about people on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who IM me and they know it's me. They know my name, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see your information.\n\nI tried to limit what I put on Facebook, but I also want to be able to communicate with my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but I don't know who can see my information.\n\nI heard that some schools banned Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I wasn't sure how schools had the right to tell students what they can and can't do on the internet. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nIs that all you have to say on this topic?",
            "I feel bad talking about the Iraq War now. I was against it from the start. But I guess it's not important anymore. Mostly everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the administration. They do not want to say they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. The United States, Iraq and the world were asked if the war was a good idea. About 75 to 80% of people said no. Even 80% of Iraqis said no. 70% of U.S. troops think the war was a bad idea and we should leave soon.\n\nI do not know what to say. The war was already a problem before we went in. And now, leaving will also be a problem. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. We have different cultures and ways of life.\n\nThis administration and past administrations think they can bring democracy to places where it is not wanted. This is not how people in that area choose to live their lives. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the good and bad before we invaded. The war made a big mess.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration has ideas about why we should stay. But I do not agree with them. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I would be okay with that. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nMany Iraqis think we should leave within a year. Some even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are saying no. If we ask them what to do, and they say leave, then it is not our fault if things go wrong.\n\nIf we leave, we can try to help again. We will not be the heroes in the Middle East, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It is not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nFor example, women often have a harder time getting jobs because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though there is supposed to be equality, many people have a hard time working with a woman in charge. This is because society has been this way for a long time.\n\nIn the workplace, women may see a job they can do and meet the requirements, but the board may not choose to promote them because it has not been common for women to be in high positions. Some industries, like fashion, can also be difficult for men. It is not common for men to stay home with children, and people often look down on them for it.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are straight. This is because men in fashion often have different styles of life. If a man in fashion has a typical style of life, people may question if he really knows about fashion.\n\nIt can be hard to change this because society has a set idea. However, people are slowly starting to accept women in business and men staying home with children. As women become more accepted in business, and men staying home become more accepted, it may become easier for people to see that both men and women can be good at different things.\n\nIt's also true that people from different areas or with different grammar skills can be discriminated against. For example, if someone from a farm with poor grammar becomes a CEO, other men may doubt his abilities because of his grammar.",
            "I think that they didn't make marijuana legal \nThey made it less serious \nFrom a crime to a traffic ticket \nYou know, something you get a fine for but not jail time \nIf you get caught with it, you might still have problems, like getting a job \nBut it's not as bad as having a real crime \nSome people think it's better to make it less serious because it's expensive to put people in jail \nTo book them, to feed them, to give them a lawyer \nIt costs a lot of money \nAnd some cities are very against marijuana \nBut Denver is more open-minded \nThey think it's okay \nAnd it's good because they have more money now to help people \nFor education, for the elderly, for the homeless \n\nI don't think marijuana should be everywhere \nBut the financial side is a good reason to make it less serious \nOther reasons are that some people don't like it \nIf it was totally legal, people might smoke it and drive \nAnd that's not safe \nAnd it's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana \nSo it would be awkward if it was out in the open \nAlcohol is bad for your driving, too \nBut marijuana can affect people's lives in other ways \nNot just their driving skills \nAnd people react differently to substances \nSome people can control themselves, but some can't \nIt's hard to say how bad marijuana is because people are different \nBut both marijuana and alcohol have their bad effects",
            "I say yes. I believe this because many things they do are like old traditions. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be connected to tradition, but it's also important to change with the times.\n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people from other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they couldn't because my dad was not a Catholic. This is not very tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others in the Catholic Church, but it seems hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the way things are practiced goes against what is taught. This is because some things are old and outdated. But they continue to do things the old way.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would change their behavior. If someone wants to do something bad, like hurt a child, they will do it anyway. This is different from a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop people who want to hurt children from doing so.",
            "I have not made up my mind on this issue.  I don't know if one side is right or wrong.  But I do think this is a difficult topic.  It is hard to decide how to define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nSomething close to the issue of church and state makes it hard to decide.  We think marriage should be a special kind of partnership between two people.  It's like being baptized.  When people get baptized, they get special benefits.  We think married people should get special benefits too.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, they should be treated the same as if they were married.  It doesn't matter if they are gay or not.  They are two people who love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on what marriage means, then the government should make it a federal law.  But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea.  It's a big decision and not worth changing the constitution for.\n\nI don't think banning gay marriage is important enough to change the constitution.  We should not change something so important just because some people disagree with it.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this issue.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not fully agree with their lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nMany states are Democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush should not be able to say the whole country is against gay marriage. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some issues should be left to each individual state. The president does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It is not fair. He will be out of office soon. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It will go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage.",
            "The writer does not agree with the school officials' actions. They say that Myspace is a public place where people can share things with others. If someone posts something on Myspace, they should expect that others, including school officials, may see it.\n\nSchool officials can see what students are doing on the internet, even if they use their own computers at home. In this case, the school officials went on the internet to prevent a school shooting. The writer believes that this was a good thing, as it may have saved lives.\n\nThe writer thinks that school officials have the right to go on the internet to check on students. If they go on the internet to catch students doing bad things, it is an invasion of privacy. But if they go on the internet to make the school a safer place, it is okay.\n\nThe writer likes to write more when they write. They say that it is easier to express themselves when they can write more. They also say that it is better to write than to talk.\n\nThe writer thinks it is silly to post something on Myspace and not expect to get in trouble. They say that everything can be seen by others, and it can come back to hurt them. They also say that once something is on the internet, it is always there.\n\nThe writer believes that school officials should not go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason, such as to make the school a safer place, it is okay. They also think that the police should be able to go on the internet to help the school officials.\n\nThe writer remembers when they went to high school. They had to do lock downs and drills to be safe. This was because of the possibility of a school shooting. The writer thinks that the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe writer is finished talking.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. At first, I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by the events of 9/11. I thought going to war would bring justice to those responsible. But now, I think we went there without a clear plan. We were not prepared for what we would face, and it backfired.\n\nI think the people in Iraq are fighting each other. They cannot unite against us if they cannot even get along with themselves. I do not think our presence in Iraq is helping their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the events of 9/11 made me feel less concerned about what is happening in Iraq. I do not think they are like us and cannot be helped by us. They have a different way of thinking about war. I believe they are not looking to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge and not to help them. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and many people wanted to go to war because of what happened on 9/11. But I do not think we had a clear plan for what we would do after going to Iraq.\n\nI think a better plan would have been to understand the situation in Iraq before we went there. We should have considered how their way of life would change and how they would react to our presence. We should have also considered what would happen after we left.\n\nIn the end, I do not think we are making enough progress in Iraq. We have made some progress, but it is not enough to justify staying there. I think the country will collapse once we leave, and we will be hurting ourselves by staying there."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not very accepting of some things.

If the Church changes its views, it will not lose its followers.\n\nSome people are against the Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not allow women to be priests and priests cannot be married. Many people think this is unfair. They believe everyone should have their own family and life outside of their job.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but they do not need a family. However, this is not true for everyone else. Most people have jobs and families. They must balance work and family life. Priests should be able to do the same. \n\nThe Church needs to be more open-minded and accept different views. This will help it keep its followers. The Church should not be against things that many people support, like gay marriage and birth control.\n\nIf the Church allows priests to be married and have families, it might not have had some problems. However, it is hard to know for sure. The Church's rules are very old and do not fit with modern society.\n\nIn the end, the Church should be more accepting of different views and allow priests to be married and have families.

            "I think gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But they are different. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but they are the same thing.\n\nGay couples have many of the same rights as others. They should be able to own property and get medical help when they are sick. But now, they can't be with their partner in the hospital.\n\nThis is not fair. A lot of scientific studies have been done on gay couples and they are just like other couples. They have the same things that make a relationship successful.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to let gay couples get married. They think it's against their religion. But the government should not be involved in church business. If a gay couple wants a marriage certificate, that's all they are asking for.\n\nJust like the civil rights movement, this is about being separate but equal. Gay couples are the same as others in many ways.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how it will affect the community. But this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They can be parents just like anyone else.\n\nChildren of gay couples are just like other children. They are influenced by their parents, but their parents' sexual orientation does not affect their parenting skills.\n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not right.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage. He thinks it's against his religion. But his views are not the only ones that matter. Morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to enforce one group's morality on the whole country. The government should be fair and equal for everyone.\n\nSome people believe that gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just what our friends and neighbors think. If we do, we will see the world in a different way.",

            "The Catholic church has changed to fit the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it was before. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. After I moved to a private school, I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend church together.\n\nNow, as I've grown older, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter service, thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some families come to church in beach clothes. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is in the church I attend. I don't know much about the church's politics, but this is my experience.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic church of not doing enough to stop priests who commit pedophilia. People think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to get married, these problems might have been avoided.\n\nI don't think this would have made a difference. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's the person, not the rules that cause the problem. When someone decides to become a priest, it's their choice. There are other religions that allow priests to get married, so if they want to get married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with it, not made that way through upbringing. You can't change it by getting married. It may come out eventually. I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.\n\nI don't have other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThis made me very upset. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

One of the Treasury Secretaries said in his book that President Bush was angry at Saddam Hussein because of his father. He wanted to expand our oil supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. But if we leave now, many more people may die. The country may fall into civil war.\n\nThe United States and the United Nations are trying a new plan.

Before we invaded Iraq, they said the war was about the September 11th terrorist attacks. But in reality, the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people after the attack to make the war seem necessary.\n\nI am against war and this one was no exception. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War in some ways. Both were long and difficult. The US government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war in Iraq. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government and tried to put in a new one. But this was a hard and long process.\n\nI do not think the US government was prepared for the problems it would face in Iraq. They should have learned from past mistakes.

They made it seem like it would be an easy thing to do.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do now. We have been in Iraq for a long time and it is hard to leave. We took away their government and their way of life. But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are still dying. The US government should have thought more about the consequences of going to war.\n\nI think the main reason for invading Iraq was to control their oil. This is one reason why we are not helping other countries become democratic.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq. But this does not seem likely.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal choice and not something that should be limited by laws. Many studies show that being gay is not a choice, but a biological fact. It is not something a person can control.\n\nI do not think politics and government should interfere with this issue. It is a personal and private matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they cannot be. However, they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. Marriage is a personal relationship between two people, not something that the government should define.\n\nStudies have shown that being gay is often a result of a chemical difference in the brain. It is something a person is born with and not something they choose. This is different from growing up in a certain way or being raised in a certain environment.\n\nIf two people, a man and a woman, want to get married, they can do so privately without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something that is made public.\n\nI am not for or against anything else about gay marriage.

They cannot ignore it. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. They may say things they do not mean. We had a situation at school like this. It was an experiment for a class. But it could be serious. Recently, something happened because someone overheard a student saying something in school.

I wasn't sure how schools had the right to tell students what they can and can't do on the internet. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nIs that all you have to say on this topic?",
            "I feel bad talking about the Iraq War now. I was against it from the start. But I guess it's not important anymore. Mostly everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the administration. They do not want to say they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. The United States, Iraq and the world were asked if the war was a good idea. About 75 to 80% of people said no. Even 80% of Iraqis said no. 70% of U.S. troops think the war was a bad idea and we should leave soon.\n\nI do not know what to say. The war was already a problem before we went in. And now, leaving will also be a problem. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. We have different cultures and ways of life.\n\nThis administration and past administrations think they can bring democracy to places where it is not wanted. This is not how people in that area choose to live their lives. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the good and bad before we invaded. The war made a big mess.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration has ideas about why we should stay. But I do not agree with them. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I would be okay with that. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nMany Iraqis think we should leave within a year. Some even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are saying no. If we ask them what to do, and they say leave, then it is not our fault if things go wrong.\n\nIf we leave, we can try to help again. We will not be the heroes in the Middle East, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It is not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nFor example, women often have a harder time getting jobs because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though there is supposed to be equality, many people have a hard time working with a woman in charge. This is because society has been this way for a long time.\n\nIn the workplace, women may see a job they can do and meet the requirements, but the board may not choose to promote them because it has not been common for women to be in high positions. Some industries, like fashion, can also be difficult for men. It is not common for men to stay home with children, and people often look down on them for it.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are straight. This is because men in fashion often have different styles of life. If a man in fashion has a typical style of life, people may question if he really knows about fashion.\n\nIt can be hard to change this because society has a set idea. However, people are slowly starting to accept women in business and men staying home with children. As women become more accepted in business, and men staying home become more accepted, it may become easier for people to see that both men and women can be good at different things.\n\nIt's also true that people from different areas or with different grammar skills can be discriminated against. For example, if someone from a farm with poor grammar becomes a CEO, other men may doubt his abilities because of his grammar.",
            "I think that they didn't make marijuana legal \nThey made it less serious \nFrom a crime to a traffic ticket \nYou know, something you get a fine for but not jail time \nIf you get caught with it, you might still have problems, like getting a job \nBut it's not as bad as having a real crime \nSome people think it's better to make it less serious because it's expensive to put people in jail \nTo book them, to feed them, to give them a lawyer \nIt costs a lot of money \nAnd some cities are very against marijuana \nBut Denver is more open-minded \nThey think it's okay \nAnd it's good because they have more money now to help people \nFor education, for the elderly, for the homeless \n\nI don't think marijuana should be everywhere \nBut the financial side is a good reason to make it less serious \nOther reasons are that some people don't like it \nIf it was totally legal, people might smoke it and drive \nAnd that's not safe \nAnd it's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana \nSo it would be awkward if it was out in the open \nAlcohol is bad for your driving, too \nBut marijuana can affect people's lives in other ways \nNot just their driving skills \nAnd people react differently to substances \nSome people can control themselves, but some can't \nIt's hard to say how bad marijuana is because people are different \nBut both marijuana and alcohol have their bad effects",
            "I say yes. I believe this because many things they do are like old traditions. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be connected to tradition, but it's also important to change with the times.\n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people from other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they couldn't because my dad was not a Catholic. This is not very tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others in the Catholic Church, but it seems hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the way things are practiced goes against what is taught. This is because some things are old and outdated. But they continue to do things the old way.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would change their behavior. If someone wants to do something bad, like hurt a child, they will do it anyway. This is different from a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop people who want to hurt children from doing so.",
            "I have not made up my mind on this issue.  I don't know if one side is right or wrong.  But I do think this is a difficult topic.  It is hard to decide how to define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nSomething close to the issue of church and state makes it hard to decide.  We think marriage should be a special kind of partnership between two people.  It's like being baptized.  When people get baptized, they get special benefits.  We think married people should get special benefits too.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, they should be treated the same as if they were married.  It doesn't matter if they are gay or not.  They are two people who love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on what marriage means, then the government should make it a federal law.  But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea.  It's a big decision and not worth changing the constitution for.\n\nI don't think banning gay marriage is important enough to change the constitution.  We should not change something so important just because some people disagree with it.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this issue.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not fully agree with their lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nMany states are Democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush should not be able to say the whole country is against gay marriage. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some issues should be left to each individual state. The president does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It is not fair. He will be out of office soon. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It will go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage.",
            "The writer does not agree with the school officials' actions. They say that Myspace is a public place where people can share things with others. If someone posts something on Myspace, they should expect that others, including school officials, may see it.\n\nSchool officials can see what students are doing on the internet, even if they use their own computers at home. In this case, the school officials went on the internet to prevent a school shooting. The writer believes that this was a good thing, as it may have saved lives.\n\nThe writer thinks that school officials have the right to go on the internet to check on students. If they go on the internet to catch students doing bad things, it is an invasion of privacy. But if they go on the internet to make the school a safer place, it is okay.\n\nThe writer likes to write more when they write. They say that it is easier to express themselves when they can write more. They also say that it is better to write than to talk.\n\nThe writer thinks it is silly to post something on Myspace and not expect to get in trouble. They say that everything can be seen by others, and it can come back to hurt them. They also say that once something is on the internet, it is always there.\n\nThe writer believes that school officials should not go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason, such as to make the school a safer place, it is okay. They also think that the police should be able to go on the internet to help the school officials.\n\nThe writer remembers when they went to high school. They had to do lock downs and drills to be safe. This was because of the possibility of a school shooting. The writer thinks that the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe writer is finished talking.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. At first, I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by the events of 9/11. I thought going to war would bring justice to those responsible. But now, I think we went there without a clear plan. We were not prepared for what we would face, and it backfired.\n\nI think the people in Iraq are fighting each other. They cannot unite against us if they cannot even get along with themselves. I do not think our presence in Iraq is helping their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the events of 9/11 made me feel less concerned about what is happening in Iraq. I do not think they are like us and cannot be helped by us. They have a different way of thinking about war. I believe they are not looking to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge and not to help them. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and many people wanted to go to war because of what happened on 9/11. But I do not think we had a clear plan for what we would do after going to Iraq.\n\nI think a better plan would have been to understand the situation in Iraq before we went there. We should have considered how their way of life would change and how they would react to our presence. We should have also considered what would happen after we left.\n\nIn the end, I do not think we are making enough progress in Iraq. We have made some progress, but it is not enough to justify staying there. I think the country will collapse once we leave, and we will be hurting ourselves by staying there."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not very accepting of some things.

If the Church changes its views, it will not lose its followers.\n\nSome people are against the Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not allow women to be priests and priests cannot be married. Many people think this is unfair. They believe everyone should have their own family and life outside of their job.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but they do not need a family. However, this is not true for everyone else. Most people have jobs and families. They must balance work and family life. Priests should be able to do the same. \n\nThe Church needs to be more open-minded and accept different views. This will help it keep its followers. The Church should not be against things that many people support, like gay marriage and birth control.\n\nIf the Church allows priests to be married and have families, it might not have had some problems. However, it is hard to know for sure. The Church's rules are very old and do not fit with modern society.\n\nIn the end, the Church should be more accepting of different views and allow priests to be married and have families.

            "I think gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But they are different. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but they are the same thing.\n\nGay couples have many of the same rights as others. They should be able to own property and get medical help when they are sick. But now, they can't be with their partner in the hospital.\n\nThis is not fair. A lot of scientific studies have been done on gay couples and they are just like other couples. They have the same things that make a relationship successful.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to let gay couples get married. They think it's against their religion. But the government should not be involved in church business. If a gay couple wants a marriage certificate, that's all they are asking for.\n\nJust like the civil rights movement, this is about being separate but equal. Gay couples are the same as others in many ways.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how it will affect the community. But this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They can be parents just like anyone else.\n\nChildren of gay couples are just like other children. They are influenced by their parents, but their parents' sexual orientation does not affect their parenting skills.\n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not right.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage. He thinks it's against his religion. But his views are not the only ones that matter. Morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to enforce one group's morality on the whole country. The government should be fair and equal for everyone.\n\nSome people believe that gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just what our friends and neighbors think. If we do, we will see the world in a different way.",

            "The Catholic church has changed to fit the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it was before. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. After I moved to a private school, I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend church together.\n\nNow, as I've grown older, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter service, thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some families come to church in beach clothes. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is in the church I attend. I don't know much about the church's politics, but this is my experience.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic church of not doing enough to stop priests who commit pedophilia. People think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to get married, these problems might have been avoided.\n\nI don't think this would have made a difference. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's the person, not the rules that cause the problem. When someone decides to become a priest, it's their choice. There are other religions that allow priests to get married, so if they want to get married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with it, not made that way through upbringing. You can't change it by getting married. It may come out eventually. I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.\n\nI don't have other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThis made me very upset. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

One of the Treasury Secretaries said in his book that President Bush was angry at Saddam Hussein because of his father. He wanted to expand our oil supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. But if we leave now, many more people may die. The country may fall into civil war.\n\nThe United States and the United Nations are trying a new plan.

Before we invaded Iraq, they said the war was about the September 11th terrorist attacks. But in reality, the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people after the attack to make the war seem necessary.\n\nI am against war and this one was no exception. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War in some ways. Both were long and difficult. The US government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war in Iraq. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government and tried to put in a new one. But this was a hard and long process.\n\nI do not think the US government was prepared for the problems it would face in Iraq. They should have learned from past mistakes.

They made it seem like it would be an easy thing to do.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do now. We have been in Iraq for a long time and it is hard to leave. We took away their government and their way of life. But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are still dying. The US government should have thought more about the consequences of going to war.\n\nI think the main reason for invading Iraq was to control their oil. This is one reason why we are not helping other countries become democratic.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq. But this does not seem likely.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal choice and not something that should be limited by laws. Many studies show that being gay is not a choice, but a biological fact. It is not something a person can control.\n\nI do not think politics and government should interfere with this issue. It is a personal and private matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they cannot be. However, they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. Marriage is a personal relationship between two people, not something that the government should define.\n\nStudies have shown that being gay is often a result of a chemical difference in the brain. It is something a person is born with and not something they choose. This is different from growing up in a certain way or being raised in a certain environment.\n\nIf two people, a man and a woman, want to get married, they can do so privately without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something that is made public.\n\nI am not for or against anything else about gay marriage.

They cannot ignore it. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. They may say things they do not mean. We had a situation at school like this. It was an experiment for a class. But it could be serious. Recently, something happened because someone overheard a student saying something in school.

I wasn't sure how schools had the right to tell students what they can and can't do on the internet. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nIs that all you have to say on this topic?",
            "I feel bad talking about the Iraq War now. I was against it from the start. But I guess it's not important anymore. Mostly everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the administration. They do not want to say they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. The United States, Iraq and the world were asked if the war was a good idea. About 75 to 80% of people said no. Even 80% of Iraqis said no. 70% of U.S. troops think the war was a bad idea and we should leave soon.\n\nI do not know what to say. The war was already a problem before we went in. And now, leaving will also be a problem. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. We have different cultures and ways of life.\n\nThis administration and past administrations think they can bring democracy to places where it is not wanted. This is not how people in that area choose to live their lives. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the good and bad before we invaded. The war made a big mess.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration has ideas about why we should stay. But I do not agree with them. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I would be okay with that. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nMany Iraqis think we should leave within a year. Some even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are saying no. If we ask them what to do, and they say leave, then it is not our fault if things go wrong.\n\nIf we leave, we can try to help again. We will not be the heroes in the Middle East, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It is not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nFor example, women often have a harder time getting jobs because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though there is supposed to be equality, many people have a hard time working with a woman in charge. This is because society has been this way for a long time.\n\nIn the workplace, women may see a job they can do and meet the requirements, but the board may not choose to promote them because it has not been common for women to be in high positions. Some industries, like fashion, can also be difficult for men. It is not common for men to stay home with children, and people often look down on them for it.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are straight. This is because men in fashion often have different styles of life. If a man in fashion has a typical style of life, people may question if he really knows about fashion.\n\nIt can be hard to change this because society has a set idea. However, people are slowly starting to accept women in business and men staying home with children. As women become more accepted in business, and men staying home become more accepted, it may become easier for people to see that both men and women can be good at different things.\n\nIt's also true that people from different areas or with different grammar skills can be discriminated against. For example, if someone from a farm with poor grammar becomes a CEO, other men may doubt his abilities because of his grammar.",
            "I think that they didn't make marijuana legal \nThey made it less serious \nFrom a crime to a traffic ticket \nYou know, something you get a fine for but not jail time \nIf you get caught with it, you might still have problems, like getting a job \nBut it's not as bad as having a real crime \nSome people think it's better to make it less serious because it's expensive to put people in jail \nTo book them, to feed them, to give them a lawyer \nIt costs a lot of money \nAnd some cities are very against marijuana \nBut Denver is more open-minded \nThey think it's okay \nAnd it's good because they have more money now to help people \nFor education, for the elderly, for the homeless \n\nI don't think marijuana should be everywhere \nBut the financial side is a good reason to make it less serious \nOther reasons are that some people don't like it \nIf it was totally legal, people might smoke it and drive \nAnd that's not safe \nAnd it's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana \nSo it would be awkward if it was out in the open \nAlcohol is bad for your driving, too \nBut marijuana can affect people's lives in other ways \nNot just their driving skills \nAnd people react differently to substances \nSome people can control themselves, but some can't \nIt's hard to say how bad marijuana is because people are different \nBut both marijuana and alcohol have their bad effects",
            "I say yes. I believe this because many things they do are like old traditions. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be connected to tradition, but it's also important to change with the times.\n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people from other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they couldn't because my dad was not a Catholic. This is not very tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others in the Catholic Church, but it seems hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the way things are practiced goes against what is taught. This is because some things are old and outdated. But they continue to do things the old way.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would change their behavior. If someone wants to do something bad, like hurt a child, they will do it anyway. This is different from a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop people who want to hurt children from doing so.",
            "I have not made up my mind on this issue.  I don't know if one side is right or wrong.  But I do think this is a difficult topic.  It is hard to decide how to define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nSomething close to the issue of church and state makes it hard to decide.  We think marriage should be a special kind of partnership between two people.  It's like being baptized.  When people get baptized, they get special benefits.  We think married people should get special benefits too.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, they should be treated the same as if they were married.  It doesn't matter if they are gay or not.  They are two people who love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on what marriage means, then the government should make it a federal law.  But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea.  It's a big decision and not worth changing the constitution for.\n\nI don't think banning gay marriage is important enough to change the constitution.  We should not change something so important just because some people disagree with it.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this issue.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not fully agree with their lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nMany states are Democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush should not be able to say the whole country is against gay marriage. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some issues should be left to each individual state. The president does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It is not fair. He will be out of office soon. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It will go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage.",
            "The writer does not agree with the school officials' actions. They say that Myspace is a public place where people can share things with others. If someone posts something on Myspace, they should expect that others, including school officials, may see it.\n\nSchool officials can see what students are doing on the internet, even if they use their own computers at home. In this case, the school officials went on the internet to prevent a school shooting. The writer believes that this was a good thing, as it may have saved lives.\n\nThe writer thinks that school officials have the right to go on the internet to check on students. If they go on the internet to catch students doing bad things, it is an invasion of privacy. But if they go on the internet to make the school a safer place, it is okay.\n\nThe writer likes to write more when they write. They say that it is easier to express themselves when they can write more. They also say that it is better to write than to talk.\n\nThe writer thinks it is silly to post something on Myspace and not expect to get in trouble. They say that everything can be seen by others, and it can come back to hurt them. They also say that once something is on the internet, it is always there.\n\nThe writer believes that school officials should not go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason, such as to make the school a safer place, it is okay. They also think that the police should be able to go on the internet to help the school officials.\n\nThe writer remembers when they went to high school. They had to do lock downs and drills to be safe. This was because of the possibility of a school shooting. The writer thinks that the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe writer is finished talking.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. At first, I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by the events of 9/11. I thought going to war would bring justice to those responsible. But now, I think we went there without a clear plan. We were not prepared for what we would face, and it backfired.\n\nI think the people in Iraq are fighting each other. They cannot unite against us if they cannot even get along with themselves. I do not think our presence in Iraq is helping their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the events of 9/11 made me feel less concerned about what is happening in Iraq. I do not think they are like us and cannot be helped by us. They have a different way of thinking about war. I believe they are not looking to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge and not to help them. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and many people wanted to go to war because of what happened on 9/11. But I do not think we had a clear plan for what we would do after going to Iraq.\n\nI think a better plan would have been to understand the situation in Iraq before we went there. We should have considered how their way of life would change and how they would react to our presence. We should have also considered what would happen after we left.\n\nIn the end, I do not think we are making enough progress in Iraq. We have made some progress, but it is not enough to justify staying there. I think the country will collapse once we leave, and we will be hurting ourselves by staying there."
