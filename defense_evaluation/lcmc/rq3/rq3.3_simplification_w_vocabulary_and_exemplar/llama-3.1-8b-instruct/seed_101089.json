            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. Their views are not very accepting of many things. For example, the Church is against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. They have strong views on these issues, but they are a bit old-fashioned. If the Church were to change its views and be more modern, it might not lose its followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church on certain subjects. They see the Church's views as wrong. The Church is against abortion, but if you are for it, you might not want to be part of a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be part of a Church that does not agree.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or have female priests. But I do not know if this would have prevented some of the problems the Church has faced. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It is hard to say.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot have a family life. Everyone else in the world works and has a family. Priests can devote their life to God, but they can also have a family.

But they are connected. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to get married. \n\nIf a gay couple gets sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. They are not considered family. \n\nThis is unfair. If you spend your life with someone, they should be able to visit you when you are sick. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship. \n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nThis is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how a gay couple will affect the community. But people are the same no matter if they are gay or straight. \n\nThey have the same roles in a relationship. They love each other and want to be together. \n\nBut people are afraid of change. They don't know what to expect. \n\nIn New York City, they have special schools for kids of gay parents. Because they get bullied in public schools. \n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be community involved like straight couples. \n\nIt's about personality, not gay or straight. \n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The federal government should make it legal in every state. \n\nI think the amendment to ban gay marriage is wrong. It's based on personal morality, but morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's unfair to ignore other people's views. \n\nThe government should be fair to everyone. It should not make laws that enforce one group's standards on the whole country. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a defect.

            "I do not agree that it is right to make marijuana legal. I think it is up to the churches and the Constitution. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not decide what is right or wrong for a church. It should let the churches decide.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. It says that the government must not interfere with the churches. If the government tries to enforce laws about marijuana, it would be against the Constitution. This would be wrong.\n\nSome people who want to make marijuana illegal are choosing the rules of one church over another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana. But this does not mean that the government should decide what the churches can and cannot make illegal.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even if someone wanted to make an amendment to the Constitution, it would be wrong. An amendment would change what is already written. It would also be against the idea of freedom.\n\nI do not think any government should control this issue. The government should not push for an amendment to ban marijuana. This would show that the government prefers one religion over others.\n\nThe government should let the churches decide about marijuana. There is no good reason for the government to get involved. It would be based on personal views, not facts. I do not see how making marijuana illegal would help the economy. It might even help it.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making marijuana legal.

Before invading Iraq, the government tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War. The government did not learn from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They did not plan for the power vacuum and chaos that would follow.\n\nThe US government tried to impose a democratic government on Iraq. This was similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They wanted to push out Communists and create a democratic government.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be long and hard. It would not be a clear victory like in many other wars. In Vietnam, the US was fighting an army, not the people. It is hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the government was not prepared for the war. They did not plan for all possible outcomes. They did not think about what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government.\n\nWe are still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying. We are trying to train the Iraqi army and police to be able to police their own country. This is a long process.\n\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people by making them think the war would be short and successful. But it takes years to implement a new form of government and make it successful.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long struggle. There was civil war and tension before we had a powerful government. The US government made the war in Iraq seem like an easy thing to do. But it is not easy.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether to stay in Iraq or leave. We took away their government and way of life. It is hard to abandon them now. But there are many American casualties, and it is hard to know how many is too many.\n\nOne of the reasons for invading Iraq was the claim that they had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were ever found. We are getting oil from Iraq, and it is often about money and controlling resources.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

This means people should not be treated unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's not right for the government to tell people what to do in their personal lives. The issue of gay marriage is not just a state or national problem, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, I see gay couples living normal lives. They walk their dogs and do the same things as other families.\n\nI don't think President Bush has the right to decide what marriage means. I think his views are old-fashioned. Scientists have found that some people are born gay because of a chemical difference in their brains. This has nothing to do with how they were raised.\n\nOne of the reasons people are against gay marriage is that it seems unnatural. But it's not just about that. If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it's a big public issue.\n\nI think marriage should be a personal matter, not something the government should decide.

When you post something, it can affect how people think of you.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have had to deal with this before. You put something on the internet, and it can hurt you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will see it. They will think you are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. Everyone can see it. If your friends have you on Myspace or Facebook, they will see the bulletin. The school has to act on it. They cannot ignore it.\n\nBut, you do not know what is real and what is not. Some people play jokes. They may say something to see how people react. It could be like an experiment gone wrong.\n\nIn our school, something happened. Someone overheard something, and they called the school. We found out who said it, and it was not a joke. He had things on his Facebook that were serious. When you put things on the internet, you have no control. If you do not want people to see it, do not put it there.\n\nIf someone looks at your Facebook or Myspace, it is not an invasion of privacy. You gave them access to it. If there is danger, the school has to take it seriously.\n\nBut, school officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at your private messages or phone calls. If it is brought to their attention, it is different.\n\nDo not friend your residents on the internet. You do not want to know what they are doing. It is not your place. You do not want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. \nIts purpose was good at the beginning. \nIt was to restore democracy in another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that purpose. \nWe are fighting for reasons that are not clear. \nMaybe we fight just to show we are strong. \n\nI think the original reason was not fair. \nThe war was started by the U.S. president George Bush's father. \nHe had a problem with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that would not be fair. \n\nI think we got our message across at the start of the war. \nBut it has been going on for too long. \nMany years have passed, and we are still fighting. \nThat is not fair to the people of the country we are fighting for. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think that is why we are fighting now. \nI think our reason for fighting has changed. \nWe are fighting just because we are fighting. \n\nI think the war should end. \nThe country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have many problems in our own country that need money. \nWe have poverty and need to fix our roads and schools. \nWe should spend our money on these things, not on a long war. \n\nMany billions of dollars are being spent on the war. \nWe do not need to spend so much money on war. \nWe can use that money to help our own people. \nIt is not right to spend our money on a war that we are not winning. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Can I ask for more information about something?\n\nSomeone was able to prevent a bad thing from happening because they looked at some information on the internet. They saw it on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to ask someone to be your \"friend\" to see their information. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it is good that someone was able to see that information and stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nBut it is also a problem. We can't have one person watching all of the students' information all the time. That would be unfair. It would be like picking out some students to watch and not others.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to have someone's job be to look at people's information on the internet. But it depends on why they were looking at it.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I saw a TV show about a man who was looking at people's information on the internet. He was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on the computer. It was scary.\n\nSome of my friends and I have talked about this problem. We know that people can see a lot of our information on the internet. We can limit what we put up, but it's hard. We want to be able to communicate with our friends, but we don't want to share too much information.\n\nI heard that a school my roommate went to banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad saying this, but it's not really important anymore. The whole country thinks it was a bad idea. The government in the United States did not agree, but most people did.\n\nNew polls show that seventy-five percent of the people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqi people think the same. Most of the American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea and they want to leave within one year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the beginning. Iraq was already in trouble before the United States came in. Now, leaving the country is also a problem. There is no easy solution to problems in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The American government thinks it can bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want this. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but is it worth invading another country?\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the pros and cons. The war has caused many problems in Iraq. We should weigh these problems against the reasons for staying. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. If the government wants to leave slowly, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should.\n\nMany Iraqis want the United States to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should leave within one year. These are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but they did not want our help. We can try to help again later, but we will at least be the good guys. Well, not really good guys, but better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. The problem is different in different jobs. \n\nFor example, in some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because society has been taught for a long time that men should be in charge. So, when a woman applies for a job, people may not choose her because of this idea.\n\nThe same thing happens with men. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion may be looked down on. People may think they don't know what fashion is for women.\n\nIt's also true for stay-at-home dads. People may think it's strange for a man to stay home and take care of children. But this is changing. More and more men are staying home to raise their kids, and people are starting to accept this.\n\nIn fields like fashion, people are starting to listen to women's opinions. But it takes time for change to happen. We have to be careful not to push too hard, or people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either. People from different places or with different backgrounds may be discriminated against in the same way. For example, a man from a rural area who has a good education but poor grammar may be looked down on by others. They may think he's not smart because of his grammar.\n\nSo, we have to work slowly and carefully to make change. We've made progress, and people are starting to accept women in charge and stay-at-home dads. But it's not easy, and it takes time.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it not a crime to have it. It's like a traffic ticket now. You can get in trouble, but it's not as bad as before.\n\nIf you get in trouble for marijuana, it can affect your life in some ways. It can affect your job and other things. This is a big problem for some people.\n\nBut some people say it's better to not make it a crime. It costs a lot to arrest and jail people. It costs money to bring them to court and to pay lawyers and judges.\n\nSome cities don't want to make this change. They don't want marijuana in their city. But some cities, like Denver, are different. They are more open to new ideas.\n\nIn Denver, they have more money now to spend on things like education and food for people who need it. This is good.\n\nMarijuana is not something we want everywhere. But it's also not something we want to ignore. There are good reasons to think about this issue carefully.\n\nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it and drive. That's a big problem. And some people would smoke it in public, and that would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol is bad for you too. It can affect your driving and your decisions. Marijuana can affect your lifestyle and your decisions too.\n\nNo two people react the same to substances. Some people can handle things well, and some people cannot. It's hard to know what to do.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol have bad effects. I think they should be treated carefully.",
            "I would say yes to changing the Catholic Church. \nBecause many of the things they do are old and do not change. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt is good to have traditions, but it is also important to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were married in a different church because my mom was Catholic and my dad was not. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \nWe are taught to love others, but the Catholic Church does not act this way. \n\nI think some Catholic teachings are good, but the way the Church acts is not always right. \nThe Church continues to do things the old way, even if it is not good. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would stop them from being bad to children. \nPeople who harm children will do it no matter what. \nIt is not the same as being married to a spouse. \n\nSo, I do not think that allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is a difficult topic. The separation of church and state and the definition of marriage make it hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know. I think that civil unions could be a good idea. Marriage is a sacrament for some people. If you are married, you should be equal in the eyes of the law. A civil union is just two people who are together.\n\nI think it is better to have a civil union instead of marriage. This way, the government does not have to get involved with the kind of marriage it is. The government should not care if people are baptized or not.\n\nI do not think that gay marriage should be a problem. It is two people who love each other and want to be together. They should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on something, it should be made into a federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not necessary. It is a small issue and not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is not a big enough issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have gay friends. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I don't agree with all of its ideas. However, I think it should be allowed. It's not a national problem. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic. Some are republican. Democratic states will support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel. I don't think you should disagree with their decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, they should be allowed to marry based on each state's decision.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI don't think President Bush should make a decision about gay marriage for the whole country. Each state should decide its own rules.\n\nI don't think gay marriage should be banned. I think the president should not decide how each state runs itself. He doesn't live in every state. He should not decide for them.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president will not be in office for long. If a new president wants to change the law, it will be changed. But each state should decide its own rules. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't have any other answer.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials checking Myspace.  Myspace is a public website.  If you post something on it, others can see it.  This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to keep it private.  It is easy to find things on the internet.  If you write something bad about someone, do not put it in an email.  Emails can come back to haunt you.\n\nOnce something is on the internet, it is always there.  If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.  School officials should not go on the internet just to catch students.  But if they find something that makes the school safer, that is okay.\n\nSchools have to keep students safe.  They have to be prepared for things like school shootings.  Schools have drills to prepare for emergencies.  School officials checked Myspace to keep the school safe.  They were not doing it just to catch students.\n\nWe had safety drills in my high school.  We practiced what to do in case of emergencies.  This was to keep the school safe.  School officials checked Myspace for the same reason.\n\nThey wanted to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.  I think that is a good reason to check Myspace.  That is all I have to say.",
            "I was for the war at first. I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help. But now I am against the war. We went to war without a plan. We did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They cannot be friends with us if they cannot be friends with themselves. I do not care about what happens there. They are fighting with each other and cannot take care of themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are savage when they fight. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were looking for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war because people were angry. He declared war on Iraq without a plan. We did not have a choice, but we could have done it better. We should have had a clear plan to create order.\n\nWe did not work together. We did not know what we were doing. I think emotion and anger led us to war. That's what we created in that country. We are not the ones to change those people. They will always be like that.\n\nWe are not making enough progress. We made some progress, but it's not enough to stay. The country will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. Their views are not very accepting of many things. For example, the Church is against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. They have strong views on these issues, but they are a bit old-fashioned. If the Church were to change its views and be more modern, it might not lose its followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church on certain subjects. They see the Church's views as wrong. The Church is against abortion, but if you are for it, you might not want to be part of a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be part of a Church that does not agree.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or have female priests. But I do not know if this would have prevented some of the problems the Church has faced. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It is hard to say.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot have a family life. Everyone else in the world works and has a family. Priests can devote their life to God, but they can also have a family.

But they are connected. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to get married. \n\nIf a gay couple gets sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. They are not considered family. \n\nThis is unfair. If you spend your life with someone, they should be able to visit you when you are sick. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship. \n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nThis is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how a gay couple will affect the community. But people are the same no matter if they are gay or straight. \n\nThey have the same roles in a relationship. They love each other and want to be together. \n\nBut people are afraid of change. They don't know what to expect. \n\nIn New York City, they have special schools for kids of gay parents. Because they get bullied in public schools. \n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be community involved like straight couples. \n\nIt's about personality, not gay or straight. \n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The federal government should make it legal in every state. \n\nI think the amendment to ban gay marriage is wrong. It's based on personal morality, but morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's unfair to ignore other people's views. \n\nThe government should be fair to everyone. It should not make laws that enforce one group's standards on the whole country. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a defect.

            "I do not agree that it is right to make marijuana legal. I think it is up to the churches and the Constitution. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not decide what is right or wrong for a church. It should let the churches decide.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. It says that the government must not interfere with the churches. If the government tries to enforce laws about marijuana, it would be against the Constitution. This would be wrong.\n\nSome people who want to make marijuana illegal are choosing the rules of one church over another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana. But this does not mean that the government should decide what the churches can and cannot make illegal.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even if someone wanted to make an amendment to the Constitution, it would be wrong. An amendment would change what is already written. It would also be against the idea of freedom.\n\nI do not think any government should control this issue. The government should not push for an amendment to ban marijuana. This would show that the government prefers one religion over others.\n\nThe government should let the churches decide about marijuana. There is no good reason for the government to get involved. It would be based on personal views, not facts. I do not see how making marijuana illegal would help the economy. It might even help it.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making marijuana legal.

Before invading Iraq, the government tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War. The government did not learn from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They did not plan for the power vacuum and chaos that would follow.\n\nThe US government tried to impose a democratic government on Iraq. This was similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They wanted to push out Communists and create a democratic government.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be long and hard. It would not be a clear victory like in many other wars. In Vietnam, the US was fighting an army, not the people. It is hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the government was not prepared for the war. They did not plan for all possible outcomes. They did not think about what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government.\n\nWe are still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying. We are trying to train the Iraqi army and police to be able to police their own country. This is a long process.\n\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people by making them think the war would be short and successful. But it takes years to implement a new form of government and make it successful.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long struggle. There was civil war and tension before we had a powerful government. The US government made the war in Iraq seem like an easy thing to do. But it is not easy.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether to stay in Iraq or leave. We took away their government and way of life. It is hard to abandon them now. But there are many American casualties, and it is hard to know how many is too many.\n\nOne of the reasons for invading Iraq was the claim that they had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were ever found. We are getting oil from Iraq, and it is often about money and controlling resources.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

This means people should not be treated unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's not right for the government to tell people what to do in their personal lives. The issue of gay marriage is not just a state or national problem, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, I see gay couples living normal lives. They walk their dogs and do the same things as other families.\n\nI don't think President Bush has the right to decide what marriage means. I think his views are old-fashioned. Scientists have found that some people are born gay because of a chemical difference in their brains. This has nothing to do with how they were raised.\n\nOne of the reasons people are against gay marriage is that it seems unnatural. But it's not just about that. If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it's a big public issue.\n\nI think marriage should be a personal matter, not something the government should decide.

When you post something, it can affect how people think of you.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have had to deal with this before. You put something on the internet, and it can hurt you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will see it. They will think you are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. Everyone can see it. If your friends have you on Myspace or Facebook, they will see the bulletin. The school has to act on it. They cannot ignore it.\n\nBut, you do not know what is real and what is not. Some people play jokes. They may say something to see how people react. It could be like an experiment gone wrong.\n\nIn our school, something happened. Someone overheard something, and they called the school. We found out who said it, and it was not a joke. He had things on his Facebook that were serious. When you put things on the internet, you have no control. If you do not want people to see it, do not put it there.\n\nIf someone looks at your Facebook or Myspace, it is not an invasion of privacy. You gave them access to it. If there is danger, the school has to take it seriously.\n\nBut, school officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at your private messages or phone calls. If it is brought to their attention, it is different.\n\nDo not friend your residents on the internet. You do not want to know what they are doing. It is not your place. You do not want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. \nIts purpose was good at the beginning. \nIt was to restore democracy in another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that purpose. \nWe are fighting for reasons that are not clear. \nMaybe we fight just to show we are strong. \n\nI think the original reason was not fair. \nThe war was started by the U.S. president George Bush's father. \nHe had a problem with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that would not be fair. \n\nI think we got our message across at the start of the war. \nBut it has been going on for too long. \nMany years have passed, and we are still fighting. \nThat is not fair to the people of the country we are fighting for. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think that is why we are fighting now. \nI think our reason for fighting has changed. \nWe are fighting just because we are fighting. \n\nI think the war should end. \nThe country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have many problems in our own country that need money. \nWe have poverty and need to fix our roads and schools. \nWe should spend our money on these things, not on a long war. \n\nMany billions of dollars are being spent on the war. \nWe do not need to spend so much money on war. \nWe can use that money to help our own people. \nIt is not right to spend our money on a war that we are not winning. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Can I ask for more information about something?\n\nSomeone was able to prevent a bad thing from happening because they looked at some information on the internet. They saw it on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to ask someone to be your \"friend\" to see their information. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it is good that someone was able to see that information and stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nBut it is also a problem. We can't have one person watching all of the students' information all the time. That would be unfair. It would be like picking out some students to watch and not others.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to have someone's job be to look at people's information on the internet. But it depends on why they were looking at it.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I saw a TV show about a man who was looking at people's information on the internet. He was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on the computer. It was scary.\n\nSome of my friends and I have talked about this problem. We know that people can see a lot of our information on the internet. We can limit what we put up, but it's hard. We want to be able to communicate with our friends, but we don't want to share too much information.\n\nI heard that a school my roommate went to banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad saying this, but it's not really important anymore. The whole country thinks it was a bad idea. The government in the United States did not agree, but most people did.\n\nNew polls show that seventy-five percent of the people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqi people think the same. Most of the American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea and they want to leave within one year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the beginning. Iraq was already in trouble before the United States came in. Now, leaving the country is also a problem. There is no easy solution to problems in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The American government thinks it can bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want this. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but is it worth invading another country?\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the pros and cons. The war has caused many problems in Iraq. We should weigh these problems against the reasons for staying. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. If the government wants to leave slowly, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should.\n\nMany Iraqis want the United States to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should leave within one year. These are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but they did not want our help. We can try to help again later, but we will at least be the good guys. Well, not really good guys, but better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. The problem is different in different jobs. \n\nFor example, in some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because society has been taught for a long time that men should be in charge. So, when a woman applies for a job, people may not choose her because of this idea.\n\nThe same thing happens with men. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion may be looked down on. People may think they don't know what fashion is for women.\n\nIt's also true for stay-at-home dads. People may think it's strange for a man to stay home and take care of children. But this is changing. More and more men are staying home to raise their kids, and people are starting to accept this.\n\nIn fields like fashion, people are starting to listen to women's opinions. But it takes time for change to happen. We have to be careful not to push too hard, or people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either. People from different places or with different backgrounds may be discriminated against in the same way. For example, a man from a rural area who has a good education but poor grammar may be looked down on by others. They may think he's not smart because of his grammar.\n\nSo, we have to work slowly and carefully to make change. We've made progress, and people are starting to accept women in charge and stay-at-home dads. But it's not easy, and it takes time.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it not a crime to have it. It's like a traffic ticket now. You can get in trouble, but it's not as bad as before.\n\nIf you get in trouble for marijuana, it can affect your life in some ways. It can affect your job and other things. This is a big problem for some people.\n\nBut some people say it's better to not make it a crime. It costs a lot to arrest and jail people. It costs money to bring them to court and to pay lawyers and judges.\n\nSome cities don't want to make this change. They don't want marijuana in their city. But some cities, like Denver, are different. They are more open to new ideas.\n\nIn Denver, they have more money now to spend on things like education and food for people who need it. This is good.\n\nMarijuana is not something we want everywhere. But it's also not something we want to ignore. There are good reasons to think about this issue carefully.\n\nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it and drive. That's a big problem. And some people would smoke it in public, and that would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol is bad for you too. It can affect your driving and your decisions. Marijuana can affect your lifestyle and your decisions too.\n\nNo two people react the same to substances. Some people can handle things well, and some people cannot. It's hard to know what to do.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol have bad effects. I think they should be treated carefully.",
            "I would say yes to changing the Catholic Church. \nBecause many of the things they do are old and do not change. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt is good to have traditions, but it is also important to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were married in a different church because my mom was Catholic and my dad was not. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \nWe are taught to love others, but the Catholic Church does not act this way. \n\nI think some Catholic teachings are good, but the way the Church acts is not always right. \nThe Church continues to do things the old way, even if it is not good. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would stop them from being bad to children. \nPeople who harm children will do it no matter what. \nIt is not the same as being married to a spouse. \n\nSo, I do not think that allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is a difficult topic. The separation of church and state and the definition of marriage make it hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know. I think that civil unions could be a good idea. Marriage is a sacrament for some people. If you are married, you should be equal in the eyes of the law. A civil union is just two people who are together.\n\nI think it is better to have a civil union instead of marriage. This way, the government does not have to get involved with the kind of marriage it is. The government should not care if people are baptized or not.\n\nI do not think that gay marriage should be a problem. It is two people who love each other and want to be together. They should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on something, it should be made into a federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not necessary. It is a small issue and not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is not a big enough issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have gay friends. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I don't agree with all of its ideas. However, I think it should be allowed. It's not a national problem. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic. Some are republican. Democratic states will support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel. I don't think you should disagree with their decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, they should be allowed to marry based on each state's decision.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI don't think President Bush should make a decision about gay marriage for the whole country. Each state should decide its own rules.\n\nI don't think gay marriage should be banned. I think the president should not decide how each state runs itself. He doesn't live in every state. He should not decide for them.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president will not be in office for long. If a new president wants to change the law, it will be changed. But each state should decide its own rules. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't have any other answer.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials checking Myspace.  Myspace is a public website.  If you post something on it, others can see it.  This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to keep it private.  It is easy to find things on the internet.  If you write something bad about someone, do not put it in an email.  Emails can come back to haunt you.\n\nOnce something is on the internet, it is always there.  If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.  School officials should not go on the internet just to catch students.  But if they find something that makes the school safer, that is okay.\n\nSchools have to keep students safe.  They have to be prepared for things like school shootings.  Schools have drills to prepare for emergencies.  School officials checked Myspace to keep the school safe.  They were not doing it just to catch students.\n\nWe had safety drills in my high school.  We practiced what to do in case of emergencies.  This was to keep the school safe.  School officials checked Myspace for the same reason.\n\nThey wanted to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.  I think that is a good reason to check Myspace.  That is all I have to say.",
            "I was for the war at first. I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help. But now I am against the war. We went to war without a plan. We did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They cannot be friends with us if they cannot be friends with themselves. I do not care about what happens there. They are fighting with each other and cannot take care of themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are savage when they fight. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were looking for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war because people were angry. He declared war on Iraq without a plan. We did not have a choice, but we could have done it better. We should have had a clear plan to create order.\n\nWe did not work together. We did not know what we were doing. I think emotion and anger led us to war. That's what we created in that country. We are not the ones to change those people. They will always be like that.\n\nWe are not making enough progress. We made some progress, but it's not enough to stay. The country will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. Their views are not very accepting of many things. For example, the Church is against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. They have strong views on these issues, but they are a bit old-fashioned. If the Church were to change its views and be more modern, it might not lose its followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church on certain subjects. They see the Church's views as wrong. The Church is against abortion, but if you are for it, you might not want to be part of a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be part of a Church that does not agree.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or have female priests. But I do not know if this would have prevented some of the problems the Church has faced. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It is hard to say.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot have a family life. Everyone else in the world works and has a family. Priests can devote their life to God, but they can also have a family.

But they are connected. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to get married. \n\nIf a gay couple gets sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. They are not considered family. \n\nThis is unfair. If you spend your life with someone, they should be able to visit you when you are sick. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship. \n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nThis is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how a gay couple will affect the community. But people are the same no matter if they are gay or straight. \n\nThey have the same roles in a relationship. They love each other and want to be together. \n\nBut people are afraid of change. They don't know what to expect. \n\nIn New York City, they have special schools for kids of gay parents. Because they get bullied in public schools. \n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be community involved like straight couples. \n\nIt's about personality, not gay or straight. \n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The federal government should make it legal in every state. \n\nI think the amendment to ban gay marriage is wrong. It's based on personal morality, but morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's unfair to ignore other people's views. \n\nThe government should be fair to everyone. It should not make laws that enforce one group's standards on the whole country. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a defect.

            "I do not agree that it is right to make marijuana legal. I think it is up to the churches and the Constitution. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not decide what is right or wrong for a church. It should let the churches decide.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. It says that the government must not interfere with the churches. If the government tries to enforce laws about marijuana, it would be against the Constitution. This would be wrong.\n\nSome people who want to make marijuana illegal are choosing the rules of one church over another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana. But this does not mean that the government should decide what the churches can and cannot make illegal.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even if someone wanted to make an amendment to the Constitution, it would be wrong. An amendment would change what is already written. It would also be against the idea of freedom.\n\nI do not think any government should control this issue. The government should not push for an amendment to ban marijuana. This would show that the government prefers one religion over others.\n\nThe government should let the churches decide about marijuana. There is no good reason for the government to get involved. It would be based on personal views, not facts. I do not see how making marijuana illegal would help the economy. It might even help it.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making marijuana legal.

Before invading Iraq, the government tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War. The government did not learn from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They did not plan for the power vacuum and chaos that would follow.\n\nThe US government tried to impose a democratic government on Iraq. This was similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They wanted to push out Communists and create a democratic government.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be long and hard. It would not be a clear victory like in many other wars. In Vietnam, the US was fighting an army, not the people. It is hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the government was not prepared for the war. They did not plan for all possible outcomes. They did not think about what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government.\n\nWe are still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying. We are trying to train the Iraqi army and police to be able to police their own country. This is a long process.\n\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people by making them think the war would be short and successful. But it takes years to implement a new form of government and make it successful.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long struggle. There was civil war and tension before we had a powerful government. The US government made the war in Iraq seem like an easy thing to do. But it is not easy.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether to stay in Iraq or leave. We took away their government and way of life. It is hard to abandon them now. But there are many American casualties, and it is hard to know how many is too many.\n\nOne of the reasons for invading Iraq was the claim that they had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were ever found. We are getting oil from Iraq, and it is often about money and controlling resources.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

This means people should not be treated unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's not right for the government to tell people what to do in their personal lives. The issue of gay marriage is not just a state or national problem, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, I see gay couples living normal lives. They walk their dogs and do the same things as other families.\n\nI don't think President Bush has the right to decide what marriage means. I think his views are old-fashioned. Scientists have found that some people are born gay because of a chemical difference in their brains. This has nothing to do with how they were raised.\n\nOne of the reasons people are against gay marriage is that it seems unnatural. But it's not just about that. If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it's a big public issue.\n\nI think marriage should be a personal matter, not something the government should decide.

When you post something, it can affect how people think of you.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have had to deal with this before. You put something on the internet, and it can hurt you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will see it. They will think you are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. Everyone can see it. If your friends have you on Myspace or Facebook, they will see the bulletin. The school has to act on it. They cannot ignore it.\n\nBut, you do not know what is real and what is not. Some people play jokes. They may say something to see how people react. It could be like an experiment gone wrong.\n\nIn our school, something happened. Someone overheard something, and they called the school. We found out who said it, and it was not a joke. He had things on his Facebook that were serious. When you put things on the internet, you have no control. If you do not want people to see it, do not put it there.\n\nIf someone looks at your Facebook or Myspace, it is not an invasion of privacy. You gave them access to it. If there is danger, the school has to take it seriously.\n\nBut, school officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at your private messages or phone calls. If it is brought to their attention, it is different.\n\nDo not friend your residents on the internet. You do not want to know what they are doing. It is not your place. You do not want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. \nIts purpose was good at the beginning. \nIt was to restore democracy in another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that purpose. \nWe are fighting for reasons that are not clear. \nMaybe we fight just to show we are strong. \n\nI think the original reason was not fair. \nThe war was started by the U.S. president George Bush's father. \nHe had a problem with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that would not be fair. \n\nI think we got our message across at the start of the war. \nBut it has been going on for too long. \nMany years have passed, and we are still fighting. \nThat is not fair to the people of the country we are fighting for. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think that is why we are fighting now. \nI think our reason for fighting has changed. \nWe are fighting just because we are fighting. \n\nI think the war should end. \nThe country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have many problems in our own country that need money. \nWe have poverty and need to fix our roads and schools. \nWe should spend our money on these things, not on a long war. \n\nMany billions of dollars are being spent on the war. \nWe do not need to spend so much money on war. \nWe can use that money to help our own people. \nIt is not right to spend our money on a war that we are not winning. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Can I ask for more information about something?\n\nSomeone was able to prevent a bad thing from happening because they looked at some information on the internet. They saw it on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to ask someone to be your \"friend\" to see their information. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it is good that someone was able to see that information and stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nBut it is also a problem. We can't have one person watching all of the students' information all the time. That would be unfair. It would be like picking out some students to watch and not others.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to have someone's job be to look at people's information on the internet. But it depends on why they were looking at it.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I saw a TV show about a man who was looking at people's information on the internet. He was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on the computer. It was scary.\n\nSome of my friends and I have talked about this problem. We know that people can see a lot of our information on the internet. We can limit what we put up, but it's hard. We want to be able to communicate with our friends, but we don't want to share too much information.\n\nI heard that a school my roommate went to banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad saying this, but it's not really important anymore. The whole country thinks it was a bad idea. The government in the United States did not agree, but most people did.\n\nNew polls show that seventy-five percent of the people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqi people think the same. Most of the American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea and they want to leave within one year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the beginning. Iraq was already in trouble before the United States came in. Now, leaving the country is also a problem. There is no easy solution to problems in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The American government thinks it can bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want this. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but is it worth invading another country?\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the pros and cons. The war has caused many problems in Iraq. We should weigh these problems against the reasons for staying. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. If the government wants to leave slowly, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should.\n\nMany Iraqis want the United States to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should leave within one year. These are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but they did not want our help. We can try to help again later, but we will at least be the good guys. Well, not really good guys, but better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. The problem is different in different jobs. \n\nFor example, in some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because society has been taught for a long time that men should be in charge. So, when a woman applies for a job, people may not choose her because of this idea.\n\nThe same thing happens with men. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion may be looked down on. People may think they don't know what fashion is for women.\n\nIt's also true for stay-at-home dads. People may think it's strange for a man to stay home and take care of children. But this is changing. More and more men are staying home to raise their kids, and people are starting to accept this.\n\nIn fields like fashion, people are starting to listen to women's opinions. But it takes time for change to happen. We have to be careful not to push too hard, or people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either. People from different places or with different backgrounds may be discriminated against in the same way. For example, a man from a rural area who has a good education but poor grammar may be looked down on by others. They may think he's not smart because of his grammar.\n\nSo, we have to work slowly and carefully to make change. We've made progress, and people are starting to accept women in charge and stay-at-home dads. But it's not easy, and it takes time.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it not a crime to have it. It's like a traffic ticket now. You can get in trouble, but it's not as bad as before.\n\nIf you get in trouble for marijuana, it can affect your life in some ways. It can affect your job and other things. This is a big problem for some people.\n\nBut some people say it's better to not make it a crime. It costs a lot to arrest and jail people. It costs money to bring them to court and to pay lawyers and judges.\n\nSome cities don't want to make this change. They don't want marijuana in their city. But some cities, like Denver, are different. They are more open to new ideas.\n\nIn Denver, they have more money now to spend on things like education and food for people who need it. This is good.\n\nMarijuana is not something we want everywhere. But it's also not something we want to ignore. There are good reasons to think about this issue carefully.\n\nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it and drive. That's a big problem. And some people would smoke it in public, and that would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol is bad for you too. It can affect your driving and your decisions. Marijuana can affect your lifestyle and your decisions too.\n\nNo two people react the same to substances. Some people can handle things well, and some people cannot. It's hard to know what to do.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol have bad effects. I think they should be treated carefully.",
            "I would say yes to changing the Catholic Church. \nBecause many of the things they do are old and do not change. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt is good to have traditions, but it is also important to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were married in a different church because my mom was Catholic and my dad was not. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \nWe are taught to love others, but the Catholic Church does not act this way. \n\nI think some Catholic teachings are good, but the way the Church acts is not always right. \nThe Church continues to do things the old way, even if it is not good. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would stop them from being bad to children. \nPeople who harm children will do it no matter what. \nIt is not the same as being married to a spouse. \n\nSo, I do not think that allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is a difficult topic. The separation of church and state and the definition of marriage make it hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know. I think that civil unions could be a good idea. Marriage is a sacrament for some people. If you are married, you should be equal in the eyes of the law. A civil union is just two people who are together.\n\nI think it is better to have a civil union instead of marriage. This way, the government does not have to get involved with the kind of marriage it is. The government should not care if people are baptized or not.\n\nI do not think that gay marriage should be a problem. It is two people who love each other and want to be together. They should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on something, it should be made into a federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not necessary. It is a small issue and not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is not a big enough issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have gay friends. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I don't agree with all of its ideas. However, I think it should be allowed. It's not a national problem. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic. Some are republican. Democratic states will support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel. I don't think you should disagree with their decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, they should be allowed to marry based on each state's decision.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI don't think President Bush should make a decision about gay marriage for the whole country. Each state should decide its own rules.\n\nI don't think gay marriage should be banned. I think the president should not decide how each state runs itself. He doesn't live in every state. He should not decide for them.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president will not be in office for long. If a new president wants to change the law, it will be changed. But each state should decide its own rules. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't have any other answer.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials checking Myspace.  Myspace is a public website.  If you post something on it, others can see it.  This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to keep it private.  It is easy to find things on the internet.  If you write something bad about someone, do not put it in an email.  Emails can come back to haunt you.\n\nOnce something is on the internet, it is always there.  If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.  School officials should not go on the internet just to catch students.  But if they find something that makes the school safer, that is okay.\n\nSchools have to keep students safe.  They have to be prepared for things like school shootings.  Schools have drills to prepare for emergencies.  School officials checked Myspace to keep the school safe.  They were not doing it just to catch students.\n\nWe had safety drills in my high school.  We practiced what to do in case of emergencies.  This was to keep the school safe.  School officials checked Myspace for the same reason.\n\nThey wanted to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.  I think that is a good reason to check Myspace.  That is all I have to say.",
            "I was for the war at first. I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help. But now I am against the war. We went to war without a plan. We did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They cannot be friends with us if they cannot be friends with themselves. I do not care about what happens there. They are fighting with each other and cannot take care of themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are savage when they fight. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were looking for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war because people were angry. He declared war on Iraq without a plan. We did not have a choice, but we could have done it better. We should have had a clear plan to create order.\n\nWe did not work together. We did not know what we were doing. I think emotion and anger led us to war. That's what we created in that country. We are not the ones to change those people. They will always be like that.\n\nWe are not making enough progress. We made some progress, but it's not enough to stay. The country will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."
