            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changed its views, it might not lose its followers.\n\nSome people do not agree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church is against abortion. If you are for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone else works and has a family life. Priests should be able to do the same.",

But some people are born gay, and that's okay.\n\nI don't think it's right to stop people from marrying who they love.  It's like saying that a man and a woman can get married, but two men or two women can't.  That's not fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue.  It's not a matter of security or moral values.  It's just a personal issue.  People should be free to make their own choices.\n\nThe government should not punish people for who they are.

So, I think making it available to the public is not a good idea. No, I do not think so. But, I think it should be used for medical purposes. This is because just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is good or bad.\n\nMany drugs against the law are used in pharmacies. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are medicines we use all the time. These are controlled substances. But we use them because they are good for people. If we deny the good qualities of marijuana just because it is against the law, that is not fair. We should accept its good qualities.\n\nI do not think marijuana is similar to alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause problems. This is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. If we do this, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is a bad thing, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. It was a special event. Later, I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nNow that I am older, I see that the church has become more casual. They have a shorter service on Sundays. People wear jeans and casual clothes, especially in the summer. Some people even come to church in their beach clothes.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is that people dress more casually. They used to wear nice clothes to church. Now, it is more relaxed.\n\nAs for other things, that is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know about the politics of the church.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic Church of not doing enough to stop priests from doing bad things. They say the church should allow women to be priests or priests to get married. But I do not think this would have stopped the bad things from happening. People who do bad things, like hurting children, are not just because they are priests. It is their choice to do bad things. Some people are married and still hurt children.\n\nI also think that when someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They can choose to be a priest or not. Some other religions allow priests to get married. If someone wants to be married and be a priest, they could choose a different religion.\n\nI think the reason some priests do bad things is because of the way their bodies are made. I think it is a genetic problem. People are born to be a certain way, and getting married will not change that. It might seem like it does not matter, but it is a natural part of who they are. If the church knew about the bad things and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is a serious offense. It goes against the principles of the Constitution. The Bush administration has been trying to limit the power of the Constitution since they were in office.\n\nI believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq.

I think the reason we went to Iraq was because of the attacks on September 11. \n\nWe are still in Iraq, and we are trying to build a democracy. We want to make Iraq like the United States. We also want to get oil from them. But staying in Iraq is causing problems. It makes people there very upset. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build a democracy. This will take a long time.

But I am also worried about the people in Iraq. They have lives and homes, and we have destroyed them. \n\nIf we stay, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will not help them.

            "I disagree with making marijuana legal. It is not right for a state to say it is legal. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is clearly stated and I think trying to control it would be against the Constitution.\n\nI think those who want to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Many Christians and Catholics do not agree with it. But I don't think the government should decide what is allowed and not allowed for churches.\n\nThe separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It allows for religious freedom in the United States. If they made an amendment about it, it would be wrong and go against the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this amendment. It seems like it is because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing a preference for one religion over others.\n\nI think it is up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There is no good reason for an amendment to ban it, except for personal views. I don't see how it will affect the economy or anything else. It might actually help the economy and society.",
            "The war in Iraq did not start well. The US government may not have been honest about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks. However, this was not true.\n\nI am against war. I think the US government made a mistake by starting a war without being prepared for the consequences. The US removed the Iraqi government. However, they did not plan for the aftermath.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. This is very sad. The US government should have known that removing the government and trying to create a new one would be difficult. They should have learned from their past mistakes, like the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government said they would create a democratic government in Iraq. But this has not happened easily. They are still trying to train the Iraqi military and police. It will take a long time to do this.\n\nI think the US government was not honest about the war. They made it seem easy to implement a new government. But it is not easy. Democracy takes time to develop, and there are often struggles. The US government should have been more careful and honest about the war.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. One reason was that I wanted him to finish what he started. But now, it is hard to know if we should stay in Iraq. Many American soldiers have died, and it is not clear if it is worth it.\n\nThe main reason for the war was to make Iraq a democratic country. But we are not doing this in other countries. I think the real reason is the oil. Iraq has a lot of oil, and the US wants to control it.\n\nThe US government also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Countries like North Korea have these weapons, but the US is not attacking them. I think the US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",

You cannot tell them what to take seriously or not.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace or Facebook. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously if there is danger.\n\nTeachers should not make a fake account to friend their students. That is the same thing. I do not friend my residents because I do not want to know what they do. If they post pictures of themselves drinking, I do not want to see it.\n\nIt is not my job to police them. I do not want that connection.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe purpose was good at first. \nIt was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal. \nNow we are fighting just to show our power. \nI think the original reason was questionable. \nIt started with George Bush's father's problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that's good. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that's not good. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I think our goal has changed. \nWe're still fighting just to be fighting. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning.\n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nTheir government will have to take care of themselves soon. \nWe should stop spending billions of dollars on war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty, that we should be spending money on. \nWar is not good for our economy. \nWe should spend money on things like roads, schools and health care.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nSomeone used the internet to find information that stopped a life from being lost. This happened because the person had put the information on Myspace.\n\nIf you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you must be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you accept someone as a friend, you give them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, you should know many people will see it.\n\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that information and stopped a life from being lost.\n\nBut it is hard to say if this is right. We cannot have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent problems. This could be unfair to some students. It is not right to have someone's job just to look at people's profiles.\n\nIt depends on why they were looking at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking randomly? I do not know.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but I know it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a TV show about someone who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute. Some people in my classes know my screen name and I do not recognize them. They IM me and they know my interests, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It is hard to limit what I put on the internet because I want to communicate with my friends.\n\nBut at the same time, I am worried about who can see what I put on the internet. I only accept people I know. However, you never know who can look at what you put on the internet.\n\nI heard that my roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. I do not know if that is a privacy issue, but I am not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students they could not have Myspace.\n\nThat is my only other thought on this subject.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the Iraq War. I do not like talking about it because I do not want to be like everyone else. But I think it is not important anymore. Most people think it was a bad idea. The US government did not agree. They do not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. In the US, Iraq, and around the world, most people think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of the Iraqis think so. Most US soldiers in Iraq also think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nI do not know what to say about this. The situation in Iraq is very difficult. It was already a problem before we came. Now it is even worse. We cannot just leave or stay without causing more problems.\n\nI think the main problem is the difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. We think we can bring democracy, but the people of Iraq may not want it. We should think about the pros and cons before making a decision. We went to Iraq and now it is a disaster.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. If we want to leave slowly, that's okay. But I do not think we should stay any longer than we have to. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year. We should listen to them.\n\nIf something goes wrong after we leave, we can say we gave them a chance to make their own decisions. If we stay and make things worse, we will not be seen as good guys. But we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.  It's not just about women, but also about the kind of work you do.\n\nFor overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we say there is equality, it's hard for people to work under a woman. This is because of how society was raised for so long.\n\nMany times, women see a job they can do and have the qualifications for it. But maybe the board won't promote them to that position because historically, women aren't in powerful business jobs.\n\nMen also face discrimination in certain fields, like fashion. It's rare to have a male parent staying at home. Society often looks down on this because they think men should be working and making money.\n\nThis can be hard on men who want to stay home with their children. Perhaps the wife has a better job and it works out fine, but society still looks down on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight. This might be because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. If a man is in fashion and has a typical style, people might wonder if he really knows what fashion is for women.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you do, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. If we keep working at our current pace, I think we can make progress. Women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are becoming stay-at-home dads.\n\nAs people learn more about others, they become more accepting. To promote this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against. If we force change, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, and change is happening slowly.\n\nI'm not sure what else we can do that isn't already being done. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they're from. If someone grows up on a farm and doesn't have the best grammar, but is intelligent and works their way up to a CEO job, other men might look down on them.\n\nSo, people can be discriminated against based on gender, where they're from, and other things. I think this is another example.",
            "The government in California changed the law about marijuana. Now, it is not a big crime to have some marijuana. You can get a ticket instead of going to jail. This is called decriminalization.\n\nThis means that people who are caught with marijuana will not have to go to jail. They will not have to pay a lot of money for fines and lawyers. This can save a lot of money for the city.\n\nSome people think this is a good idea. They say it will help cities that are running out of money. They can use the money they save to help people.\n\nOne city in Colorado, Denver, made this change. Now they have more money to help people. They can use it for schools, for old people, and for people who do not have enough to eat.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this change. Some people think marijuana should not be allowed. They think it is bad for people to use it.\n\nIf marijuana is made legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes. People could smoke it anywhere. This could be a problem because some people drive cars while smoking marijuana. It could be bad for them.\n\nSome people think alcohol is worse than marijuana. Alcohol can hurt a person's ability to drive. Marijuana can also hurt a person's ability to make good decisions.\n\nBut people are different. How they react to marijuana is different. Some people can use it and be fine. Others cannot use it at all.\n\nSo, it is hard to say if marijuana is good or bad. It depends on the person.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nA lot of the things they do are traditional. \nLike they have done the same things for a long time. \nAnd it's good to be rooted in tradition. \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics think they need to go to church every week. \nAnd they are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules. \nAnd it doesn't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nIt also doesn't accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey wouldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not really being tolerant of other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it's hypocritical to say love others and not accept them. \nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things. \nBut the way the church practices goes against it. \nBecause it's old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think this would make a difference. \nI personally think it would be good to allow priests to marry. \nBut I don't think this would stop them from acting inappropriately with children. \nBecause it's different from being married to an adult. \nSo if you're going to do something bad, you probably will do it anyway. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these bad things from happening. \nI think they would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. But I think this is a very difficult problem to solve. It is hard to separate the government from the church. And it is hard to define marriage without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is considered a sacred thing by many people. If it is a marriage, then the government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is. It should just look at it as a union between two people.\n\nIf two people are in a union, they should be treated the same as everyone else. The government should not care about what kind of union it is.\n\nI think if all the states agree on this issue, it should be made a law across the country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is a big problem for some people, but it is not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution just to define marriage. It should not be changed to take away someone's right to get married.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a bit confusing for me. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, some are Republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same chances as heterosexuals. Each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He should not make all states follow his ideas. I do not agree with his ban on gay marriage. I think each state should decide.\n\nI think some things should be left to each state. President Bush will not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state should work. Some things should be decided by each state, not the president. He will be out of office soon. A new president may change the law on gay marriage. It should be up to each state.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ideas on this.",
            "I do not agree with this. First, Myspace is a public thing. If you post something on the internet, you must be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. Even if the post is not made under the school's name, they can still find it. They can look at it in their homes.\n\nIn a situation like a school shooting, I think it is okay for school officials to search for information on the internet. If it helps keep students safe, then it is a good thing. It is a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nIf school officials look at a student's Myspace page just to see if they are doing something they should not, that is an invasion of privacy. But if they are trying to make the school a safer place, then I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is a public thing, and if you do something on the internet, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something bad about someone, you should not put it on an email. You never know who might see it.\n\nIf you do something wrong when you are a student, it can come back to haunt you when you are older. Once something is on the internet, it is hard to get rid of it. You can get in trouble for things you did a long time ago.\n\nIf school officials have a good reason to look at a student's Myspace page, then it is okay. But they should not just look at it to catch students. They should only look at it if it will make the school a safer place.\n\nWhen parents send their children to school, they want them to be safe. That is why the school officials looked at the Myspace page. They wanted to make sure the school was safe, like they do with lockdown drills.\n\nThe school officials did what was necessary to keep students safe. They looked at the Myspace page to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. We practiced lockdown drills in my school to make sure we were safe.\n\nThat is all I have to say on this.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was for it at first because of what happened on 9/11. I felt we needed to strike back. But as time went on, I realized we were not prepared. We didn't have a clear plan.\n\nI think we made things worse. We went to war without thinking about the future. We just acted out of emotion and anger. This led to more problems.\n\nI don't think we should be in Iraq. They are fighting among themselves. As long as they are fighting each other, they won't attack us.\n\nI don't care about what happens in Iraq. I don't think they are able to work together. They are not like us. War is very different for them.\n\nI think we just wanted revenge after 9/11. President Bush said we needed to go to war with Iraq. He declared war, but I think he didn't have a clear plan.\n\nWe should have left Iraq alone. We can't stay there forever. If we leave, things will get worse. We are hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough. We should go home and let them deal with their problems. We can't change them. They will always be the way they are."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changed its views, it might not lose its followers.\n\nSome people do not agree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church is against abortion. If you are for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone else works and has a family life. Priests should be able to do the same.",

But some people are born gay, and that's okay.\n\nI don't think it's right to stop people from marrying who they love.  It's like saying that a man and a woman can get married, but two men or two women can't.  That's not fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue.  It's not a matter of security or moral values.  It's just a personal issue.  People should be free to make their own choices.\n\nThe government should not punish people for who they are.

So, I think making it available to the public is not a good idea. No, I do not think so. But, I think it should be used for medical purposes. This is because just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is good or bad.\n\nMany drugs against the law are used in pharmacies. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are medicines we use all the time. These are controlled substances. But we use them because they are good for people. If we deny the good qualities of marijuana just because it is against the law, that is not fair. We should accept its good qualities.\n\nI do not think marijuana is similar to alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause problems. This is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. If we do this, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is a bad thing, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. It was a special event. Later, I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nNow that I am older, I see that the church has become more casual. They have a shorter service on Sundays. People wear jeans and casual clothes, especially in the summer. Some people even come to church in their beach clothes.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is that people dress more casually. They used to wear nice clothes to church. Now, it is more relaxed.\n\nAs for other things, that is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know about the politics of the church.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic Church of not doing enough to stop priests from doing bad things. They say the church should allow women to be priests or priests to get married. But I do not think this would have stopped the bad things from happening. People who do bad things, like hurting children, are not just because they are priests. It is their choice to do bad things. Some people are married and still hurt children.\n\nI also think that when someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They can choose to be a priest or not. Some other religions allow priests to get married. If someone wants to be married and be a priest, they could choose a different religion.\n\nI think the reason some priests do bad things is because of the way their bodies are made. I think it is a genetic problem. People are born to be a certain way, and getting married will not change that. It might seem like it does not matter, but it is a natural part of who they are. If the church knew about the bad things and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is a serious offense. It goes against the principles of the Constitution. The Bush administration has been trying to limit the power of the Constitution since they were in office.\n\nI believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq.

I think the reason we went to Iraq was because of the attacks on September 11. \n\nWe are still in Iraq, and we are trying to build a democracy. We want to make Iraq like the United States. We also want to get oil from them. But staying in Iraq is causing problems. It makes people there very upset. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build a democracy. This will take a long time.

But I am also worried about the people in Iraq. They have lives and homes, and we have destroyed them. \n\nIf we stay, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will not help them.

            "I disagree with making marijuana legal. It is not right for a state to say it is legal. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is clearly stated and I think trying to control it would be against the Constitution.\n\nI think those who want to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Many Christians and Catholics do not agree with it. But I don't think the government should decide what is allowed and not allowed for churches.\n\nThe separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It allows for religious freedom in the United States. If they made an amendment about it, it would be wrong and go against the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this amendment. It seems like it is because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing a preference for one religion over others.\n\nI think it is up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There is no good reason for an amendment to ban it, except for personal views. I don't see how it will affect the economy or anything else. It might actually help the economy and society.",
            "The war in Iraq did not start well. The US government may not have been honest about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks. However, this was not true.\n\nI am against war. I think the US government made a mistake by starting a war without being prepared for the consequences. The US removed the Iraqi government. However, they did not plan for the aftermath.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. This is very sad. The US government should have known that removing the government and trying to create a new one would be difficult. They should have learned from their past mistakes, like the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government said they would create a democratic government in Iraq. But this has not happened easily. They are still trying to train the Iraqi military and police. It will take a long time to do this.\n\nI think the US government was not honest about the war. They made it seem easy to implement a new government. But it is not easy. Democracy takes time to develop, and there are often struggles. The US government should have been more careful and honest about the war.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. One reason was that I wanted him to finish what he started. But now, it is hard to know if we should stay in Iraq. Many American soldiers have died, and it is not clear if it is worth it.\n\nThe main reason for the war was to make Iraq a democratic country. But we are not doing this in other countries. I think the real reason is the oil. Iraq has a lot of oil, and the US wants to control it.\n\nThe US government also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Countries like North Korea have these weapons, but the US is not attacking them. I think the US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",

You cannot tell them what to take seriously or not.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace or Facebook. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously if there is danger.\n\nTeachers should not make a fake account to friend their students. That is the same thing. I do not friend my residents because I do not want to know what they do. If they post pictures of themselves drinking, I do not want to see it.\n\nIt is not my job to police them. I do not want that connection.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe purpose was good at first. \nIt was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal. \nNow we are fighting just to show our power. \nI think the original reason was questionable. \nIt started with George Bush's father's problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that's good. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that's not good. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I think our goal has changed. \nWe're still fighting just to be fighting. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning.\n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nTheir government will have to take care of themselves soon. \nWe should stop spending billions of dollars on war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty, that we should be spending money on. \nWar is not good for our economy. \nWe should spend money on things like roads, schools and health care.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nSomeone used the internet to find information that stopped a life from being lost. This happened because the person had put the information on Myspace.\n\nIf you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you must be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you accept someone as a friend, you give them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, you should know many people will see it.\n\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that information and stopped a life from being lost.\n\nBut it is hard to say if this is right. We cannot have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent problems. This could be unfair to some students. It is not right to have someone's job just to look at people's profiles.\n\nIt depends on why they were looking at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking randomly? I do not know.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but I know it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a TV show about someone who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute. Some people in my classes know my screen name and I do not recognize them. They IM me and they know my interests, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It is hard to limit what I put on the internet because I want to communicate with my friends.\n\nBut at the same time, I am worried about who can see what I put on the internet. I only accept people I know. However, you never know who can look at what you put on the internet.\n\nI heard that my roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. I do not know if that is a privacy issue, but I am not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students they could not have Myspace.\n\nThat is my only other thought on this subject.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the Iraq War. I do not like talking about it because I do not want to be like everyone else. But I think it is not important anymore. Most people think it was a bad idea. The US government did not agree. They do not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. In the US, Iraq, and around the world, most people think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of the Iraqis think so. Most US soldiers in Iraq also think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nI do not know what to say about this. The situation in Iraq is very difficult. It was already a problem before we came. Now it is even worse. We cannot just leave or stay without causing more problems.\n\nI think the main problem is the difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. We think we can bring democracy, but the people of Iraq may not want it. We should think about the pros and cons before making a decision. We went to Iraq and now it is a disaster.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. If we want to leave slowly, that's okay. But I do not think we should stay any longer than we have to. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year. We should listen to them.\n\nIf something goes wrong after we leave, we can say we gave them a chance to make their own decisions. If we stay and make things worse, we will not be seen as good guys. But we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.  It's not just about women, but also about the kind of work you do.\n\nFor overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we say there is equality, it's hard for people to work under a woman. This is because of how society was raised for so long.\n\nMany times, women see a job they can do and have the qualifications for it. But maybe the board won't promote them to that position because historically, women aren't in powerful business jobs.\n\nMen also face discrimination in certain fields, like fashion. It's rare to have a male parent staying at home. Society often looks down on this because they think men should be working and making money.\n\nThis can be hard on men who want to stay home with their children. Perhaps the wife has a better job and it works out fine, but society still looks down on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight. This might be because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. If a man is in fashion and has a typical style, people might wonder if he really knows what fashion is for women.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you do, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. If we keep working at our current pace, I think we can make progress. Women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are becoming stay-at-home dads.\n\nAs people learn more about others, they become more accepting. To promote this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against. If we force change, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, and change is happening slowly.\n\nI'm not sure what else we can do that isn't already being done. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they're from. If someone grows up on a farm and doesn't have the best grammar, but is intelligent and works their way up to a CEO job, other men might look down on them.\n\nSo, people can be discriminated against based on gender, where they're from, and other things. I think this is another example.",
            "The government in California changed the law about marijuana. Now, it is not a big crime to have some marijuana. You can get a ticket instead of going to jail. This is called decriminalization.\n\nThis means that people who are caught with marijuana will not have to go to jail. They will not have to pay a lot of money for fines and lawyers. This can save a lot of money for the city.\n\nSome people think this is a good idea. They say it will help cities that are running out of money. They can use the money they save to help people.\n\nOne city in Colorado, Denver, made this change. Now they have more money to help people. They can use it for schools, for old people, and for people who do not have enough to eat.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this change. Some people think marijuana should not be allowed. They think it is bad for people to use it.\n\nIf marijuana is made legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes. People could smoke it anywhere. This could be a problem because some people drive cars while smoking marijuana. It could be bad for them.\n\nSome people think alcohol is worse than marijuana. Alcohol can hurt a person's ability to drive. Marijuana can also hurt a person's ability to make good decisions.\n\nBut people are different. How they react to marijuana is different. Some people can use it and be fine. Others cannot use it at all.\n\nSo, it is hard to say if marijuana is good or bad. It depends on the person.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nA lot of the things they do are traditional. \nLike they have done the same things for a long time. \nAnd it's good to be rooted in tradition. \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics think they need to go to church every week. \nAnd they are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules. \nAnd it doesn't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nIt also doesn't accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey wouldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not really being tolerant of other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it's hypocritical to say love others and not accept them. \nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things. \nBut the way the church practices goes against it. \nBecause it's old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think this would make a difference. \nI personally think it would be good to allow priests to marry. \nBut I don't think this would stop them from acting inappropriately with children. \nBecause it's different from being married to an adult. \nSo if you're going to do something bad, you probably will do it anyway. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these bad things from happening. \nI think they would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. But I think this is a very difficult problem to solve. It is hard to separate the government from the church. And it is hard to define marriage without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is considered a sacred thing by many people. If it is a marriage, then the government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is. It should just look at it as a union between two people.\n\nIf two people are in a union, they should be treated the same as everyone else. The government should not care about what kind of union it is.\n\nI think if all the states agree on this issue, it should be made a law across the country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is a big problem for some people, but it is not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution just to define marriage. It should not be changed to take away someone's right to get married.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a bit confusing for me. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, some are Republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same chances as heterosexuals. Each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He should not make all states follow his ideas. I do not agree with his ban on gay marriage. I think each state should decide.\n\nI think some things should be left to each state. President Bush will not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state should work. Some things should be decided by each state, not the president. He will be out of office soon. A new president may change the law on gay marriage. It should be up to each state.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ideas on this.",
            "I do not agree with this. First, Myspace is a public thing. If you post something on the internet, you must be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. Even if the post is not made under the school's name, they can still find it. They can look at it in their homes.\n\nIn a situation like a school shooting, I think it is okay for school officials to search for information on the internet. If it helps keep students safe, then it is a good thing. It is a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nIf school officials look at a student's Myspace page just to see if they are doing something they should not, that is an invasion of privacy. But if they are trying to make the school a safer place, then I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is a public thing, and if you do something on the internet, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something bad about someone, you should not put it on an email. You never know who might see it.\n\nIf you do something wrong when you are a student, it can come back to haunt you when you are older. Once something is on the internet, it is hard to get rid of it. You can get in trouble for things you did a long time ago.\n\nIf school officials have a good reason to look at a student's Myspace page, then it is okay. But they should not just look at it to catch students. They should only look at it if it will make the school a safer place.\n\nWhen parents send their children to school, they want them to be safe. That is why the school officials looked at the Myspace page. They wanted to make sure the school was safe, like they do with lockdown drills.\n\nThe school officials did what was necessary to keep students safe. They looked at the Myspace page to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. We practiced lockdown drills in my school to make sure we were safe.\n\nThat is all I have to say on this.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was for it at first because of what happened on 9/11. I felt we needed to strike back. But as time went on, I realized we were not prepared. We didn't have a clear plan.\n\nI think we made things worse. We went to war without thinking about the future. We just acted out of emotion and anger. This led to more problems.\n\nI don't think we should be in Iraq. They are fighting among themselves. As long as they are fighting each other, they won't attack us.\n\nI don't care about what happens in Iraq. I don't think they are able to work together. They are not like us. War is very different for them.\n\nI think we just wanted revenge after 9/11. President Bush said we needed to go to war with Iraq. He declared war, but I think he didn't have a clear plan.\n\nWe should have left Iraq alone. We can't stay there forever. If we leave, things will get worse. We are hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough. We should go home and let them deal with their problems. We can't change them. They will always be the way they are."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changed its views, it might not lose its followers.\n\nSome people do not agree with the Church on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church is against abortion. If you are for abortion, you might not feel comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree with you.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God. But everyone else works and has a family life. Priests should be able to do the same.",

But some people are born gay, and that's okay.\n\nI don't think it's right to stop people from marrying who they love.  It's like saying that a man and a woman can get married, but two men or two women can't.  That's not fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue.  It's not a matter of security or moral values.  It's just a personal issue.  People should be free to make their own choices.\n\nThe government should not punish people for who they are.

So, I think making it available to the public is not a good idea. No, I do not think so. But, I think it should be used for medical purposes. This is because just because a drug is against the law does not mean it is good or bad.\n\nMany drugs against the law are used in pharmacies. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are medicines we use all the time. These are controlled substances. But we use them because they are good for people. If we deny the good qualities of marijuana just because it is against the law, that is not fair. We should accept its good qualities.\n\nI do not think marijuana is similar to alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause problems. This is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but not all at once. If we do this, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is a bad thing, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law.

            "I think the church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. It was a special event. Later, I went to a private school and saw my friends on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nNow that I am older, I see that the church has become more casual. They have a shorter service on Sundays. People wear jeans and casual clothes, especially in the summer. Some people even come to church in their beach clothes.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is that people dress more casually. They used to wear nice clothes to church. Now, it is more relaxed.\n\nAs for other things, that is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know about the politics of the church.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic Church of not doing enough to stop priests from doing bad things. They say the church should allow women to be priests or priests to get married. But I do not think this would have stopped the bad things from happening. People who do bad things, like hurting children, are not just because they are priests. It is their choice to do bad things. Some people are married and still hurt children.\n\nI also think that when someone becomes a priest, it is their choice. They can choose to be a priest or not. Some other religions allow priests to get married. If someone wants to be married and be a priest, they could choose a different religion.\n\nI think the reason some priests do bad things is because of the way their bodies are made. I think it is a genetic problem. People are born to be a certain way, and getting married will not change that. It might seem like it does not matter, but it is a natural part of who they are. If the church knew about the bad things and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

Even Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not convinced by the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is a serious offense. It goes against the principles of the Constitution. The Bush administration has been trying to limit the power of the Constitution since they were in office.\n\nI believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq.

I think the reason we went to Iraq was because of the attacks on September 11. \n\nWe are still in Iraq, and we are trying to build a democracy. We want to make Iraq like the United States. We also want to get oil from them. But staying in Iraq is causing problems. It makes people there very upset. \n\nIf we stay, we will have to try to build a democracy. This will take a long time.

But I am also worried about the people in Iraq. They have lives and homes, and we have destroyed them. \n\nIf we stay, we will try to change their culture to be like ours. This will not help them.

            "I disagree with making marijuana legal. It is not right for a state to say it is legal. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is clearly stated and I think trying to control it would be against the Constitution.\n\nI think those who want to make it illegal are choosing one church's beliefs over another. Many Christians and Catholics do not agree with it. But I don't think the government should decide what is allowed and not allowed for churches.\n\nThe separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It allows for religious freedom in the United States. If they made an amendment about it, it would be wrong and go against the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few amendments that restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI don't think the government should get involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this amendment. It seems like it is because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing a preference for one religion over others.\n\nI think it is up to the churches to decide this, not the president or the government. There is no good reason for an amendment to ban it, except for personal views. I don't see how it will affect the economy or anything else. It might actually help the economy and society.",
            "The war in Iraq did not start well. The US government may not have been honest about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, they tried to link it to the 9/11 attacks. However, this was not true.\n\nI am against war. I think the US government made a mistake by starting a war without being prepared for the consequences. The US removed the Iraqi government. However, they did not plan for the aftermath.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. This is very sad. The US government should have known that removing the government and trying to create a new one would be difficult. They should have learned from their past mistakes, like the Vietnam War.\n\nThe US government said they would create a democratic government in Iraq. But this has not happened easily. They are still trying to train the Iraqi military and police. It will take a long time to do this.\n\nI think the US government was not honest about the war. They made it seem easy to implement a new government. But it is not easy. Democracy takes time to develop, and there are often struggles. The US government should have been more careful and honest about the war.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. One reason was that I wanted him to finish what he started. But now, it is hard to know if we should stay in Iraq. Many American soldiers have died, and it is not clear if it is worth it.\n\nThe main reason for the war was to make Iraq a democratic country. But we are not doing this in other countries. I think the real reason is the oil. Iraq has a lot of oil, and the US wants to control it.\n\nThe US government also said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Countries like North Korea have these weapons, but the US is not attacking them. I think the US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",

You cannot tell them what to take seriously or not.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on Myspace or Facebook. But if someone brings it to their attention, they have to take it seriously if there is danger.\n\nTeachers should not make a fake account to friend their students. That is the same thing. I do not friend my residents because I do not want to know what they do. If they post pictures of themselves drinking, I do not want to see it.\n\nIt is not my job to police them. I do not want that connection.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe purpose was good at first. \nIt was to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal. \nNow we are fighting just to show our power. \nI think the original reason was questionable. \nIt started with George Bush's father's problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that's good. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that's not good. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I think our goal has changed. \nWe're still fighting just to be fighting. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning.\n\nI think the war has lasted long enough. \nTheir government will have to take care of themselves soon. \nWe should stop spending billions of dollars on war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty, that we should be spending money on. \nWar is not good for our economy. \nWe should spend money on things like roads, schools and health care.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "Can I ask a question to clarify something?\n\nSomeone used the internet to find information that stopped a life from being lost. This happened because the person had put the information on Myspace.\n\nIf you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you must be friends with someone to see their profile. But if you accept someone as a friend, you give them permission to see your profile.\n\nSo, anytime you put information on the internet, you should know many people will see it.\n\nIn this case, I think it was good that someone saw that information and stopped a life from being lost.\n\nBut it is hard to say if this is right. We cannot have one person watching everyone's profiles all day to prevent problems. This could be unfair to some students. It is not right to have someone's job just to look at people's profiles.\n\nIt depends on why they were looking at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking randomly? I do not know.\n\nI have a Facebook account, but I know it bothers me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a TV show about someone who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in less than a minute. Some people in my classes know my screen name and I do not recognize them. They IM me and they know my interests, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It is hard to limit what I put on the internet because I want to communicate with my friends.\n\nBut at the same time, I am worried about who can see what I put on the internet. I only accept people I know. However, you never know who can look at what you put on the internet.\n\nI heard that my roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. I do not know if that is a privacy issue, but I am not sure how the school officials had the right to tell students they could not have Myspace.\n\nThat is my only other thought on this subject.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the Iraq War. I do not like talking about it because I do not want to be like everyone else. But I think it is not important anymore. Most people think it was a bad idea. The US government did not agree. They do not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. In the US, Iraq, and around the world, most people think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of the Iraqis think so. Most US soldiers in Iraq also think it was a bad idea. They want to leave within a year.\n\nI do not know what to say about this. The situation in Iraq is very difficult. It was already a problem before we came. Now it is even worse. We cannot just leave or stay without causing more problems.\n\nI think the main problem is the difference in culture between the US and the Middle East. We think we can bring democracy, but the people of Iraq may not want it. We should think about the pros and cons before making a decision. We went to Iraq and now it is a disaster.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. If we want to leave slowly, that's okay. But I do not think we should stay any longer than we have to. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year. We should listen to them.\n\nIf something goes wrong after we leave, we can say we gave them a chance to make their own decisions. If we stay and make things worse, we will not be seen as good guys. But we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States.  It's not just about women, but also about the kind of work you do.\n\nFor overall, I think women have it harder because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though we say there is equality, it's hard for people to work under a woman. This is because of how society was raised for so long.\n\nMany times, women see a job they can do and have the qualifications for it. But maybe the board won't promote them to that position because historically, women aren't in powerful business jobs.\n\nMen also face discrimination in certain fields, like fashion. It's rare to have a male parent staying at home. Society often looks down on this because they think men should be working and making money.\n\nThis can be hard on men who want to stay home with their children. Perhaps the wife has a better job and it works out fine, but society still looks down on them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people often don't take men seriously if they're straight. This might be because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. If a man is in fashion and has a typical style, people might wonder if he really knows what fashion is for women.\n\nDepending on the kind of work you do, I think there is definitely gender discrimination in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set way of thinking. We've made progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. If we keep working at our current pace, I think we can make progress. Women are becoming CEOs and getting accepted in business, and more men are becoming stay-at-home dads.\n\nAs people learn more about others, they become more accepting. To promote this, we need to show the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against. If we force change, people will resist. We're at a good balance now, and change is happening slowly.\n\nI'm not sure what else we can do that isn't already being done. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they're from. If someone grows up on a farm and doesn't have the best grammar, but is intelligent and works their way up to a CEO job, other men might look down on them.\n\nSo, people can be discriminated against based on gender, where they're from, and other things. I think this is another example.",
            "The government in California changed the law about marijuana. Now, it is not a big crime to have some marijuana. You can get a ticket instead of going to jail. This is called decriminalization.\n\nThis means that people who are caught with marijuana will not have to go to jail. They will not have to pay a lot of money for fines and lawyers. This can save a lot of money for the city.\n\nSome people think this is a good idea. They say it will help cities that are running out of money. They can use the money they save to help people.\n\nOne city in Colorado, Denver, made this change. Now they have more money to help people. They can use it for schools, for old people, and for people who do not have enough to eat.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with this change. Some people think marijuana should not be allowed. They think it is bad for people to use it.\n\nIf marijuana is made legal, it could be sold in stores like cigarettes. People could smoke it anywhere. This could be a problem because some people drive cars while smoking marijuana. It could be bad for them.\n\nSome people think alcohol is worse than marijuana. Alcohol can hurt a person's ability to drive. Marijuana can also hurt a person's ability to make good decisions.\n\nBut people are different. How they react to marijuana is different. Some people can use it and be fine. Others cannot use it at all.\n\nSo, it is hard to say if marijuana is good or bad. It depends on the person.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nA lot of the things they do are traditional. \nLike they have done the same things for a long time. \nAnd it's good to be rooted in tradition. \nBut it's also important to be adaptable to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics think they need to go to church every week. \nAnd they are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules. \nAnd it doesn't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nIt also doesn't accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was an Episcopalian. \nThey wouldn't marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not really being tolerant of other religions. \nWe learned to love others in Catholic school. \nBut it's hypocritical to say love others and not accept them. \nSo I think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things. \nBut the way the church practices goes against it. \nBecause it's old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think this would make a difference. \nI personally think it would be good to allow priests to marry. \nBut I don't think this would stop them from acting inappropriately with children. \nBecause it's different from being married to an adult. \nSo if you're going to do something bad, you probably will do it anyway. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop these bad things from happening. \nI think they would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. But I think this is a very difficult problem to solve. It is hard to separate the government from the church. And it is hard to define marriage without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is considered a sacred thing by many people. If it is a marriage, then the government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is. It should just look at it as a union between two people.\n\nIf two people are in a union, they should be treated the same as everyone else. The government should not care about what kind of union it is.\n\nI think if all the states agree on this issue, it should be made a law across the country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is a big problem for some people, but it is not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution just to define marriage. It should not be changed to take away someone's right to get married.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a bit confusing for me. I have many friends who are gay. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, some are Republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should have the same chances as heterosexuals. Each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He should not make all states follow his ideas. I do not agree with his ban on gay marriage. I think each state should decide.\n\nI think some things should be left to each state. President Bush will not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state should work. Some things should be decided by each state, not the president. He will be out of office soon. A new president may change the law on gay marriage. It should be up to each state.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ideas on this.",
            "I do not agree with this. First, Myspace is a public thing. If you post something on the internet, you must be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. Even if the post is not made under the school's name, they can still find it. They can look at it in their homes.\n\nIn a situation like a school shooting, I think it is okay for school officials to search for information on the internet. If it helps keep students safe, then it is a good thing. It is a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nIf school officials look at a student's Myspace page just to see if they are doing something they should not, that is an invasion of privacy. But if they are trying to make the school a safer place, then I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is a public thing, and if you do something on the internet, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something bad about someone, you should not put it on an email. You never know who might see it.\n\nIf you do something wrong when you are a student, it can come back to haunt you when you are older. Once something is on the internet, it is hard to get rid of it. You can get in trouble for things you did a long time ago.\n\nIf school officials have a good reason to look at a student's Myspace page, then it is okay. But they should not just look at it to catch students. They should only look at it if it will make the school a safer place.\n\nWhen parents send their children to school, they want them to be safe. That is why the school officials looked at the Myspace page. They wanted to make sure the school was safe, like they do with lockdown drills.\n\nThe school officials did what was necessary to keep students safe. They looked at the Myspace page to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. We practiced lockdown drills in my school to make sure we were safe.\n\nThat is all I have to say on this.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was for it at first because of what happened on 9/11. I felt we needed to strike back. But as time went on, I realized we were not prepared. We didn't have a clear plan.\n\nI think we made things worse. We went to war without thinking about the future. We just acted out of emotion and anger. This led to more problems.\n\nI don't think we should be in Iraq. They are fighting among themselves. As long as they are fighting each other, they won't attack us.\n\nI don't care about what happens in Iraq. I don't think they are able to work together. They are not like us. War is very different for them.\n\nI think we just wanted revenge after 9/11. President Bush said we needed to go to war with Iraq. He declared war, but I think he didn't have a clear plan.\n\nWe should have left Iraq alone. We can't stay there forever. If we leave, things will get worse. We are hurting ourselves by staying.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough. We should go home and let them deal with their problems. We can't change them. They will always be the way they are."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. Their views are not very accepting of many things. For example, the Church is against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. They have strong views on these issues, but they are a bit old-fashioned. If the Church were to change its views and be more modern, it might not lose its followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church on certain subjects. They see the Church's views as wrong. The Church is against abortion, but if you are for it, you might not want to be part of a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be part of a Church that does not agree.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or have female priests. But I do not know if this would have prevented some of the problems the Church has faced. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It is hard to say.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot have a family life. Everyone else in the world works and has a family. Priests can devote their life to God, but they can also have a family.

But they are connected. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to get married. \n\nIf a gay couple gets sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. They are not considered family. \n\nThis is unfair. If you spend your life with someone, they should be able to visit you when you are sick. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship. \n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nThis is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how a gay couple will affect the community. But people are the same no matter if they are gay or straight. \n\nThey have the same roles in a relationship. They love each other and want to be together. \n\nBut people are afraid of change. They don't know what to expect. \n\nIn New York City, they have special schools for kids of gay parents. Because they get bullied in public schools. \n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be community involved like straight couples. \n\nIt's about personality, not gay or straight. \n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The federal government should make it legal in every state. \n\nI think the amendment to ban gay marriage is wrong. It's based on personal morality, but morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's unfair to ignore other people's views. \n\nThe government should be fair to everyone. It should not make laws that enforce one group's standards on the whole country. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a defect.

            "I do not agree that it is right to make marijuana legal. I think it is up to the churches and the Constitution. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not decide what is right or wrong for a church. It should let the churches decide.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. It says that the government must not interfere with the churches. If the government tries to enforce laws about marijuana, it would be against the Constitution. This would be wrong.\n\nSome people who want to make marijuana illegal are choosing the rules of one church over another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana. But this does not mean that the government should decide what the churches can and cannot make illegal.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even if someone wanted to make an amendment to the Constitution, it would be wrong. An amendment would change what is already written. It would also be against the idea of freedom.\n\nI do not think any government should control this issue. The government should not push for an amendment to ban marijuana. This would show that the government prefers one religion over others.\n\nThe government should let the churches decide about marijuana. There is no good reason for the government to get involved. It would be based on personal views, not facts. I do not see how making marijuana illegal would help the economy. It might even help it.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making marijuana legal.

Before invading Iraq, the government tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War. The government did not learn from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They did not plan for the power vacuum and chaos that would follow.\n\nThe US government tried to impose a democratic government on Iraq. This was similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They wanted to push out Communists and create a democratic government.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be long and hard. It would not be a clear victory like in many other wars. In Vietnam, the US was fighting an army, not the people. It is hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the government was not prepared for the war. They did not plan for all possible outcomes. They did not think about what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government.\n\nWe are still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying. We are trying to train the Iraqi army and police to be able to police their own country. This is a long process.\n\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people by making them think the war would be short and successful. But it takes years to implement a new form of government and make it successful.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long struggle. There was civil war and tension before we had a powerful government. The US government made the war in Iraq seem like an easy thing to do. But it is not easy.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether to stay in Iraq or leave. We took away their government and way of life. It is hard to abandon them now. But there are many American casualties, and it is hard to know how many is too many.\n\nOne of the reasons for invading Iraq was the claim that they had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were ever found. We are getting oil from Iraq, and it is often about money and controlling resources.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

This means people should not be treated unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's not right for the government to tell people what to do in their personal lives. The issue of gay marriage is not just a state or national problem, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, I see gay couples living normal lives. They walk their dogs and do the same things as other families.\n\nI don't think President Bush has the right to decide what marriage means. I think his views are old-fashioned. Scientists have found that some people are born gay because of a chemical difference in their brains. This has nothing to do with how they were raised.\n\nOne of the reasons people are against gay marriage is that it seems unnatural. But it's not just about that. If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it's a big public issue.\n\nI think marriage should be a personal matter, not something the government should decide.

When you post something, it can affect how people think of you.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have had to deal with this before. You put something on the internet, and it can hurt you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will see it. They will think you are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. Everyone can see it. If your friends have you on Myspace or Facebook, they will see the bulletin. The school has to act on it. They cannot ignore it.\n\nBut, you do not know what is real and what is not. Some people play jokes. They may say something to see how people react. It could be like an experiment gone wrong.\n\nIn our school, something happened. Someone overheard something, and they called the school. We found out who said it, and it was not a joke. He had things on his Facebook that were serious. When you put things on the internet, you have no control. If you do not want people to see it, do not put it there.\n\nIf someone looks at your Facebook or Myspace, it is not an invasion of privacy. You gave them access to it. If there is danger, the school has to take it seriously.\n\nBut, school officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at your private messages or phone calls. If it is brought to their attention, it is different.\n\nDo not friend your residents on the internet. You do not want to know what they are doing. It is not your place. You do not want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. \nIts purpose was good at the beginning. \nIt was to restore democracy in another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that purpose. \nWe are fighting for reasons that are not clear. \nMaybe we fight just to show we are strong. \n\nI think the original reason was not fair. \nThe war was started by the U.S. president George Bush's father. \nHe had a problem with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that would not be fair. \n\nI think we got our message across at the start of the war. \nBut it has been going on for too long. \nMany years have passed, and we are still fighting. \nThat is not fair to the people of the country we are fighting for. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think that is why we are fighting now. \nI think our reason for fighting has changed. \nWe are fighting just because we are fighting. \n\nI think the war should end. \nThe country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have many problems in our own country that need money. \nWe have poverty and need to fix our roads and schools. \nWe should spend our money on these things, not on a long war. \n\nMany billions of dollars are being spent on the war. \nWe do not need to spend so much money on war. \nWe can use that money to help our own people. \nIt is not right to spend our money on a war that we are not winning. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Can I ask for more information about something?\n\nSomeone was able to prevent a bad thing from happening because they looked at some information on the internet. They saw it on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to ask someone to be your \"friend\" to see their information. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it is good that someone was able to see that information and stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nBut it is also a problem. We can't have one person watching all of the students' information all the time. That would be unfair. It would be like picking out some students to watch and not others.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to have someone's job be to look at people's information on the internet. But it depends on why they were looking at it.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I saw a TV show about a man who was looking at people's information on the internet. He was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on the computer. It was scary.\n\nSome of my friends and I have talked about this problem. We know that people can see a lot of our information on the internet. We can limit what we put up, but it's hard. We want to be able to communicate with our friends, but we don't want to share too much information.\n\nI heard that a school my roommate went to banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad saying this, but it's not really important anymore. The whole country thinks it was a bad idea. The government in the United States did not agree, but most people did.\n\nNew polls show that seventy-five percent of the people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqi people think the same. Most of the American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea and they want to leave within one year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the beginning. Iraq was already in trouble before the United States came in. Now, leaving the country is also a problem. There is no easy solution to problems in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The American government thinks it can bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want this. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but is it worth invading another country?\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the pros and cons. The war has caused many problems in Iraq. We should weigh these problems against the reasons for staying. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. If the government wants to leave slowly, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should.\n\nMany Iraqis want the United States to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should leave within one year. These are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but they did not want our help. We can try to help again later, but we will at least be the good guys. Well, not really good guys, but better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. The problem is different in different jobs. \n\nFor example, in some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because society has been taught for a long time that men should be in charge. So, when a woman applies for a job, people may not choose her because of this idea.\n\nThe same thing happens with men. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion may be looked down on. People may think they don't know what fashion is for women.\n\nIt's also true for stay-at-home dads. People may think it's strange for a man to stay home and take care of children. But this is changing. More and more men are staying home to raise their kids, and people are starting to accept this.\n\nIn fields like fashion, people are starting to listen to women's opinions. But it takes time for change to happen. We have to be careful not to push too hard, or people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either. People from different places or with different backgrounds may be discriminated against in the same way. For example, a man from a rural area who has a good education but poor grammar may be looked down on by others. They may think he's not smart because of his grammar.\n\nSo, we have to work slowly and carefully to make change. We've made progress, and people are starting to accept women in charge and stay-at-home dads. But it's not easy, and it takes time.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it not a crime to have it. It's like a traffic ticket now. You can get in trouble, but it's not as bad as before.\n\nIf you get in trouble for marijuana, it can affect your life in some ways. It can affect your job and other things. This is a big problem for some people.\n\nBut some people say it's better to not make it a crime. It costs a lot to arrest and jail people. It costs money to bring them to court and to pay lawyers and judges.\n\nSome cities don't want to make this change. They don't want marijuana in their city. But some cities, like Denver, are different. They are more open to new ideas.\n\nIn Denver, they have more money now to spend on things like education and food for people who need it. This is good.\n\nMarijuana is not something we want everywhere. But it's also not something we want to ignore. There are good reasons to think about this issue carefully.\n\nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it and drive. That's a big problem. And some people would smoke it in public, and that would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol is bad for you too. It can affect your driving and your decisions. Marijuana can affect your lifestyle and your decisions too.\n\nNo two people react the same to substances. Some people can handle things well, and some people cannot. It's hard to know what to do.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol have bad effects. I think they should be treated carefully.",
            "I would say yes to changing the Catholic Church. \nBecause many of the things they do are old and do not change. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt is good to have traditions, but it is also important to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were married in a different church because my mom was Catholic and my dad was not. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \nWe are taught to love others, but the Catholic Church does not act this way. \n\nI think some Catholic teachings are good, but the way the Church acts is not always right. \nThe Church continues to do things the old way, even if it is not good. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would stop them from being bad to children. \nPeople who harm children will do it no matter what. \nIt is not the same as being married to a spouse. \n\nSo, I do not think that allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is a difficult topic. The separation of church and state and the definition of marriage make it hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know. I think that civil unions could be a good idea. Marriage is a sacrament for some people. If you are married, you should be equal in the eyes of the law. A civil union is just two people who are together.\n\nI think it is better to have a civil union instead of marriage. This way, the government does not have to get involved with the kind of marriage it is. The government should not care if people are baptized or not.\n\nI do not think that gay marriage should be a problem. It is two people who love each other and want to be together. They should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on something, it should be made into a federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not necessary. It is a small issue and not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is not a big enough issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have gay friends. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I don't agree with all of its ideas. However, I think it should be allowed. It's not a national problem. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic. Some are republican. Democratic states will support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel. I don't think you should disagree with their decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, they should be allowed to marry based on each state's decision.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI don't think President Bush should make a decision about gay marriage for the whole country. Each state should decide its own rules.\n\nI don't think gay marriage should be banned. I think the president should not decide how each state runs itself. He doesn't live in every state. He should not decide for them.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president will not be in office for long. If a new president wants to change the law, it will be changed. But each state should decide its own rules. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't have any other answer.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials checking Myspace.  Myspace is a public website.  If you post something on it, others can see it.  This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to keep it private.  It is easy to find things on the internet.  If you write something bad about someone, do not put it in an email.  Emails can come back to haunt you.\n\nOnce something is on the internet, it is always there.  If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.  School officials should not go on the internet just to catch students.  But if they find something that makes the school safer, that is okay.\n\nSchools have to keep students safe.  They have to be prepared for things like school shootings.  Schools have drills to prepare for emergencies.  School officials checked Myspace to keep the school safe.  They were not doing it just to catch students.\n\nWe had safety drills in my high school.  We practiced what to do in case of emergencies.  This was to keep the school safe.  School officials checked Myspace for the same reason.\n\nThey wanted to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.  I think that is a good reason to check Myspace.  That is all I have to say.",
            "I was for the war at first. I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help. But now I am against the war. We went to war without a plan. We did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They cannot be friends with us if they cannot be friends with themselves. I do not care about what happens there. They are fighting with each other and cannot take care of themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are savage when they fight. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were looking for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war because people were angry. He declared war on Iraq without a plan. We did not have a choice, but we could have done it better. We should have had a clear plan to create order.\n\nWe did not work together. We did not know what we were doing. I think emotion and anger led us to war. That's what we created in that country. We are not the ones to change those people. They will always be like that.\n\nWe are not making enough progress. We made some progress, but it's not enough to stay. The country will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. Their views are not very accepting of many things. For example, the Church is against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. They have strong views on these issues, but they are a bit old-fashioned. If the Church were to change its views and be more modern, it might not lose its followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church on certain subjects. They see the Church's views as wrong. The Church is against abortion, but if you are for it, you might not want to be part of a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be part of a Church that does not agree.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or have female priests. But I do not know if this would have prevented some of the problems the Church has faced. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It is hard to say.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot have a family life. Everyone else in the world works and has a family. Priests can devote their life to God, but they can also have a family.

But they are connected. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to get married. \n\nIf a gay couple gets sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. They are not considered family. \n\nThis is unfair. If you spend your life with someone, they should be able to visit you when you are sick. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship. \n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nThis is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how a gay couple will affect the community. But people are the same no matter if they are gay or straight. \n\nThey have the same roles in a relationship. They love each other and want to be together. \n\nBut people are afraid of change. They don't know what to expect. \n\nIn New York City, they have special schools for kids of gay parents. Because they get bullied in public schools. \n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be community involved like straight couples. \n\nIt's about personality, not gay or straight. \n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The federal government should make it legal in every state. \n\nI think the amendment to ban gay marriage is wrong. It's based on personal morality, but morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's unfair to ignore other people's views. \n\nThe government should be fair to everyone. It should not make laws that enforce one group's standards on the whole country. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a defect.

            "I do not agree that it is right to make marijuana legal. I think it is up to the churches and the Constitution. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not decide what is right or wrong for a church. It should let the churches decide.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. It says that the government must not interfere with the churches. If the government tries to enforce laws about marijuana, it would be against the Constitution. This would be wrong.\n\nSome people who want to make marijuana illegal are choosing the rules of one church over another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana. But this does not mean that the government should decide what the churches can and cannot make illegal.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even if someone wanted to make an amendment to the Constitution, it would be wrong. An amendment would change what is already written. It would also be against the idea of freedom.\n\nI do not think any government should control this issue. The government should not push for an amendment to ban marijuana. This would show that the government prefers one religion over others.\n\nThe government should let the churches decide about marijuana. There is no good reason for the government to get involved. It would be based on personal views, not facts. I do not see how making marijuana illegal would help the economy. It might even help it.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making marijuana legal.

Before invading Iraq, the government tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War. The government did not learn from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They did not plan for the power vacuum and chaos that would follow.\n\nThe US government tried to impose a democratic government on Iraq. This was similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They wanted to push out Communists and create a democratic government.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be long and hard. It would not be a clear victory like in many other wars. In Vietnam, the US was fighting an army, not the people. It is hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the government was not prepared for the war. They did not plan for all possible outcomes. They did not think about what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government.\n\nWe are still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying. We are trying to train the Iraqi army and police to be able to police their own country. This is a long process.\n\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people by making them think the war would be short and successful. But it takes years to implement a new form of government and make it successful.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long struggle. There was civil war and tension before we had a powerful government. The US government made the war in Iraq seem like an easy thing to do. But it is not easy.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether to stay in Iraq or leave. We took away their government and way of life. It is hard to abandon them now. But there are many American casualties, and it is hard to know how many is too many.\n\nOne of the reasons for invading Iraq was the claim that they had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were ever found. We are getting oil from Iraq, and it is often about money and controlling resources.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

This means people should not be treated unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's not right for the government to tell people what to do in their personal lives. The issue of gay marriage is not just a state or national problem, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, I see gay couples living normal lives. They walk their dogs and do the same things as other families.\n\nI don't think President Bush has the right to decide what marriage means. I think his views are old-fashioned. Scientists have found that some people are born gay because of a chemical difference in their brains. This has nothing to do with how they were raised.\n\nOne of the reasons people are against gay marriage is that it seems unnatural. But it's not just about that. If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it's a big public issue.\n\nI think marriage should be a personal matter, not something the government should decide.

When you post something, it can affect how people think of you.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have had to deal with this before. You put something on the internet, and it can hurt you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will see it. They will think you are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. Everyone can see it. If your friends have you on Myspace or Facebook, they will see the bulletin. The school has to act on it. They cannot ignore it.\n\nBut, you do not know what is real and what is not. Some people play jokes. They may say something to see how people react. It could be like an experiment gone wrong.\n\nIn our school, something happened. Someone overheard something, and they called the school. We found out who said it, and it was not a joke. He had things on his Facebook that were serious. When you put things on the internet, you have no control. If you do not want people to see it, do not put it there.\n\nIf someone looks at your Facebook or Myspace, it is not an invasion of privacy. You gave them access to it. If there is danger, the school has to take it seriously.\n\nBut, school officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at your private messages or phone calls. If it is brought to their attention, it is different.\n\nDo not friend your residents on the internet. You do not want to know what they are doing. It is not your place. You do not want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. \nIts purpose was good at the beginning. \nIt was to restore democracy in another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that purpose. \nWe are fighting for reasons that are not clear. \nMaybe we fight just to show we are strong. \n\nI think the original reason was not fair. \nThe war was started by the U.S. president George Bush's father. \nHe had a problem with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that would not be fair. \n\nI think we got our message across at the start of the war. \nBut it has been going on for too long. \nMany years have passed, and we are still fighting. \nThat is not fair to the people of the country we are fighting for. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think that is why we are fighting now. \nI think our reason for fighting has changed. \nWe are fighting just because we are fighting. \n\nI think the war should end. \nThe country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have many problems in our own country that need money. \nWe have poverty and need to fix our roads and schools. \nWe should spend our money on these things, not on a long war. \n\nMany billions of dollars are being spent on the war. \nWe do not need to spend so much money on war. \nWe can use that money to help our own people. \nIt is not right to spend our money on a war that we are not winning. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Can I ask for more information about something?\n\nSomeone was able to prevent a bad thing from happening because they looked at some information on the internet. They saw it on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to ask someone to be your \"friend\" to see their information. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it is good that someone was able to see that information and stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nBut it is also a problem. We can't have one person watching all of the students' information all the time. That would be unfair. It would be like picking out some students to watch and not others.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to have someone's job be to look at people's information on the internet. But it depends on why they were looking at it.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I saw a TV show about a man who was looking at people's information on the internet. He was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on the computer. It was scary.\n\nSome of my friends and I have talked about this problem. We know that people can see a lot of our information on the internet. We can limit what we put up, but it's hard. We want to be able to communicate with our friends, but we don't want to share too much information.\n\nI heard that a school my roommate went to banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad saying this, but it's not really important anymore. The whole country thinks it was a bad idea. The government in the United States did not agree, but most people did.\n\nNew polls show that seventy-five percent of the people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqi people think the same. Most of the American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea and they want to leave within one year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the beginning. Iraq was already in trouble before the United States came in. Now, leaving the country is also a problem. There is no easy solution to problems in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The American government thinks it can bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want this. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but is it worth invading another country?\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the pros and cons. The war has caused many problems in Iraq. We should weigh these problems against the reasons for staying. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. If the government wants to leave slowly, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should.\n\nMany Iraqis want the United States to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should leave within one year. These are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but they did not want our help. We can try to help again later, but we will at least be the good guys. Well, not really good guys, but better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. The problem is different in different jobs. \n\nFor example, in some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because society has been taught for a long time that men should be in charge. So, when a woman applies for a job, people may not choose her because of this idea.\n\nThe same thing happens with men. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion may be looked down on. People may think they don't know what fashion is for women.\n\nIt's also true for stay-at-home dads. People may think it's strange for a man to stay home and take care of children. But this is changing. More and more men are staying home to raise their kids, and people are starting to accept this.\n\nIn fields like fashion, people are starting to listen to women's opinions. But it takes time for change to happen. We have to be careful not to push too hard, or people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either. People from different places or with different backgrounds may be discriminated against in the same way. For example, a man from a rural area who has a good education but poor grammar may be looked down on by others. They may think he's not smart because of his grammar.\n\nSo, we have to work slowly and carefully to make change. We've made progress, and people are starting to accept women in charge and stay-at-home dads. But it's not easy, and it takes time.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it not a crime to have it. It's like a traffic ticket now. You can get in trouble, but it's not as bad as before.\n\nIf you get in trouble for marijuana, it can affect your life in some ways. It can affect your job and other things. This is a big problem for some people.\n\nBut some people say it's better to not make it a crime. It costs a lot to arrest and jail people. It costs money to bring them to court and to pay lawyers and judges.\n\nSome cities don't want to make this change. They don't want marijuana in their city. But some cities, like Denver, are different. They are more open to new ideas.\n\nIn Denver, they have more money now to spend on things like education and food for people who need it. This is good.\n\nMarijuana is not something we want everywhere. But it's also not something we want to ignore. There are good reasons to think about this issue carefully.\n\nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it and drive. That's a big problem. And some people would smoke it in public, and that would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol is bad for you too. It can affect your driving and your decisions. Marijuana can affect your lifestyle and your decisions too.\n\nNo two people react the same to substances. Some people can handle things well, and some people cannot. It's hard to know what to do.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol have bad effects. I think they should be treated carefully.",
            "I would say yes to changing the Catholic Church. \nBecause many of the things they do are old and do not change. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt is good to have traditions, but it is also important to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were married in a different church because my mom was Catholic and my dad was not. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \nWe are taught to love others, but the Catholic Church does not act this way. \n\nI think some Catholic teachings are good, but the way the Church acts is not always right. \nThe Church continues to do things the old way, even if it is not good. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would stop them from being bad to children. \nPeople who harm children will do it no matter what. \nIt is not the same as being married to a spouse. \n\nSo, I do not think that allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is a difficult topic. The separation of church and state and the definition of marriage make it hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know. I think that civil unions could be a good idea. Marriage is a sacrament for some people. If you are married, you should be equal in the eyes of the law. A civil union is just two people who are together.\n\nI think it is better to have a civil union instead of marriage. This way, the government does not have to get involved with the kind of marriage it is. The government should not care if people are baptized or not.\n\nI do not think that gay marriage should be a problem. It is two people who love each other and want to be together. They should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on something, it should be made into a federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not necessary. It is a small issue and not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is not a big enough issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have gay friends. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I don't agree with all of its ideas. However, I think it should be allowed. It's not a national problem. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic. Some are republican. Democratic states will support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel. I don't think you should disagree with their decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, they should be allowed to marry based on each state's decision.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI don't think President Bush should make a decision about gay marriage for the whole country. Each state should decide its own rules.\n\nI don't think gay marriage should be banned. I think the president should not decide how each state runs itself. He doesn't live in every state. He should not decide for them.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president will not be in office for long. If a new president wants to change the law, it will be changed. But each state should decide its own rules. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't have any other answer.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials checking Myspace.  Myspace is a public website.  If you post something on it, others can see it.  This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to keep it private.  It is easy to find things on the internet.  If you write something bad about someone, do not put it in an email.  Emails can come back to haunt you.\n\nOnce something is on the internet, it is always there.  If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.  School officials should not go on the internet just to catch students.  But if they find something that makes the school safer, that is okay.\n\nSchools have to keep students safe.  They have to be prepared for things like school shootings.  Schools have drills to prepare for emergencies.  School officials checked Myspace to keep the school safe.  They were not doing it just to catch students.\n\nWe had safety drills in my high school.  We practiced what to do in case of emergencies.  This was to keep the school safe.  School officials checked Myspace for the same reason.\n\nThey wanted to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.  I think that is a good reason to check Myspace.  That is all I have to say.",
            "I was for the war at first. I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help. But now I am against the war. We went to war without a plan. We did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They cannot be friends with us if they cannot be friends with themselves. I do not care about what happens there. They are fighting with each other and cannot take care of themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are savage when they fight. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were looking for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war because people were angry. He declared war on Iraq without a plan. We did not have a choice, but we could have done it better. We should have had a clear plan to create order.\n\nWe did not work together. We did not know what we were doing. I think emotion and anger led us to war. That's what we created in that country. We are not the ones to change those people. They will always be like that.\n\nWe are not making enough progress. We made some progress, but it's not enough to stay. The country will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. Their views are not very accepting of many things. For example, the Church is against gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. They have strong views on these issues, but they are a bit old-fashioned. If the Church were to change its views and be more modern, it might not lose its followers.\n\nMany people are starting to disagree with the Church on certain subjects. They see the Church's views as wrong. The Church is against abortion, but if you are for it, you might not want to be part of a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be part of a Church that does not agree.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or have female priests. But I do not know if this would have prevented some of the problems the Church has faced. If priests were allowed to be married, would they have acted differently? It is hard to say.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot have a family life. Everyone else in the world works and has a family. Priests can devote their life to God, but they can also have a family.

But they are connected. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should have the right to get married. \n\nIf a gay couple gets sick, their partner can't visit them in the hospital. They are not considered family. \n\nThis is unfair. If you spend your life with someone, they should be able to visit you when you are sick. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship. \n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage? \n\nThis is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nPeople worry about adoption and how a gay couple will affect the community. But people are the same no matter if they are gay or straight. \n\nThey have the same roles in a relationship. They love each other and want to be together. \n\nBut people are afraid of change. They don't know what to expect. \n\nIn New York City, they have special schools for kids of gay parents. Because they get bullied in public schools. \n\nGay couples can be good parents. They can be community involved like straight couples. \n\nIt's about personality, not gay or straight. \n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The federal government should make it legal in every state. \n\nI think the amendment to ban gay marriage is wrong. It's based on personal morality, but morality is different for everyone. \n\nThe government should not make laws based on one group's morality. It's unfair to ignore other people's views. \n\nThe government should be fair to everyone. It should not make laws that enforce one group's standards on the whole country. \n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a defect.

            "I do not agree that it is right to make marijuana legal. I think it is up to the churches and the Constitution. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not decide what is right or wrong for a church. It should let the churches decide.\n\nThe Constitution is very clear on this. It says that the government must not interfere with the churches. If the government tries to enforce laws about marijuana, it would be against the Constitution. This would be wrong.\n\nSome people who want to make marijuana illegal are choosing the rules of one church over another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana. But this does not mean that the government should decide what the churches can and cannot make illegal.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Even if someone wanted to make an amendment to the Constitution, it would be wrong. An amendment would change what is already written. It would also be against the idea of freedom.\n\nI do not think any government should control this issue. The government should not push for an amendment to ban marijuana. This would show that the government prefers one religion over others.\n\nThe government should let the churches decide about marijuana. There is no good reason for the government to get involved. It would be based on personal views, not facts. I do not see how making marijuana illegal would help the economy. It might even help it.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree with making marijuana legal.

Before invading Iraq, the government tried to link the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War. The government did not learn from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of removing the Iraqi government. They did not plan for the power vacuum and chaos that would follow.\n\nThe US government tried to impose a democratic government on Iraq. This was similar to what they tried to do in Vietnam. They wanted to push out Communists and create a democratic government.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be long and hard. It would not be a clear victory like in many other wars. In Vietnam, the US was fighting an army, not the people. It is hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the government was not prepared for the war. They did not plan for all possible outcomes. They did not think about what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government.\n\nWe are still in Iraq today, and many American soldiers are still dying. We are trying to train the Iraqi army and police to be able to police their own country. This is a long process.\n\nI think the government tried to deceive the American people by making them think the war would be short and successful. But it takes years to implement a new form of government and make it successful.\n\nIn our own country, democracy was a long struggle. There was civil war and tension before we had a powerful government. The US government made the war in Iraq seem like an easy thing to do. But it is not easy.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether to stay in Iraq or leave. We took away their government and way of life. It is hard to abandon them now. But there are many American casualties, and it is hard to know how many is too many.\n\nOne of the reasons for invading Iraq was the claim that they had weapons of mass destruction. But no such weapons were ever found. We are getting oil from Iraq, and it is often about money and controlling resources.\n\nLet's hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq.

This means people should not be treated unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it's not right for the government to tell people what to do in their personal lives. The issue of gay marriage is not just a state or national problem, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, I see gay couples living normal lives. They walk their dogs and do the same things as other families.\n\nI don't think President Bush has the right to decide what marriage means. I think his views are old-fashioned. Scientists have found that some people are born gay because of a chemical difference in their brains. This has nothing to do with how they were raised.\n\nOne of the reasons people are against gay marriage is that it seems unnatural. But it's not just about that. If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it's a big public issue.\n\nI think marriage should be a personal matter, not something the government should decide.

When you post something, it can affect how people think of you.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I have had to deal with this before. You put something on the internet, and it can hurt you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will see it. They will think you are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. Everyone can see it. If your friends have you on Myspace or Facebook, they will see the bulletin. The school has to act on it. They cannot ignore it.\n\nBut, you do not know what is real and what is not. Some people play jokes. They may say something to see how people react. It could be like an experiment gone wrong.\n\nIn our school, something happened. Someone overheard something, and they called the school. We found out who said it, and it was not a joke. He had things on his Facebook that were serious. When you put things on the internet, you have no control. If you do not want people to see it, do not put it there.\n\nIf someone looks at your Facebook or Myspace, it is not an invasion of privacy. You gave them access to it. If there is danger, the school has to take it seriously.\n\nBut, school officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at your private messages or phone calls. If it is brought to their attention, it is different.\n\nDo not friend your residents on the internet. You do not want to know what they are doing. It is not your place. You do not want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. \nIts purpose was good at the beginning. \nIt was to restore democracy in another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that purpose. \nWe are fighting for reasons that are not clear. \nMaybe we fight just to show we are strong. \n\nI think the original reason was not fair. \nThe war was started by the U.S. president George Bush's father. \nHe had a problem with Saddam Hussein. \nIf the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair government, that would be a good reason. \nBut if there were personal reasons, that would not be fair. \n\nI think we got our message across at the start of the war. \nBut it has been going on for too long. \nMany years have passed, and we are still fighting. \nThat is not fair to the people of the country we are fighting for. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would be a good reason for war. \nBut I do not think that is why we are fighting now. \nI think our reason for fighting has changed. \nWe are fighting just because we are fighting. \n\nI think the war should end. \nThe country's government will have to take care of itself soon. \nWe have many problems in our own country that need money. \nWe have poverty and need to fix our roads and schools. \nWe should spend our money on these things, not on a long war. \n\nMany billions of dollars are being spent on the war. \nWe do not need to spend so much money on war. \nWe can use that money to help our own people. \nIt is not right to spend our money on a war that we are not winning. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Can I ask for more information about something?\n\nSomeone was able to prevent a bad thing from happening because they looked at some information on the internet. They saw it on a website called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to ask someone to be your \"friend\" to see their information. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nI think it is good that someone was able to see that information and stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nBut it is also a problem. We can't have one person watching all of the students' information all the time. That would be unfair. It would be like picking out some students to watch and not others.\n\nI don't think it is a good idea to have someone's job be to look at people's information on the internet. But it depends on why they were looking at it.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and it bothers me that there are people who can see my information. I saw a TV show about a man who was looking at people's information on the internet. He was able to find a girl's screen name and talk to her on the computer. It was scary.\n\nSome of my friends and I have talked about this problem. We know that people can see a lot of our information on the internet. We can limit what we put up, but it's hard. We want to be able to communicate with our friends, but we don't want to share too much information.\n\nI heard that a school my roommate went to banned students from having Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad saying this, but it's not really important anymore. The whole country thinks it was a bad idea. The government in the United States did not agree, but most people did.\n\nNew polls show that seventy-five percent of the people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Eighty percent of Iraqi people think the same. Most of the American soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea and they want to leave within one year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the beginning. Iraq was already in trouble before the United States came in. Now, leaving the country is also a problem. There is no easy solution to problems in the Middle East.\n\nThe United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The American government thinks it can bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want this. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but is it worth invading another country?\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the pros and cons. The war has caused many problems in Iraq. We should weigh these problems against the reasons for staying. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. If the government wants to leave slowly, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should.\n\nMany Iraqis want the United States to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should leave within one year. These are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but they did not want our help. We can try to help again later, but we will at least be the good guys. Well, not really good guys, but better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. It's not just about women, though. The problem is different in different jobs. \n\nFor example, in some areas, women have a harder time getting ahead. This is because society has been taught for a long time that men should be in charge. So, when a woman applies for a job, people may not choose her because of this idea.\n\nThe same thing happens with men. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion may be looked down on. People may think they don't know what fashion is for women.\n\nIt's also true for stay-at-home dads. People may think it's strange for a man to stay home and take care of children. But this is changing. More and more men are staying home to raise their kids, and people are starting to accept this.\n\nIn fields like fashion, people are starting to listen to women's opinions. But it takes time for change to happen. We have to be careful not to push too hard, or people will resist. We've made progress, and change takes time.\n\nIt's not just about gender, either. People from different places or with different backgrounds may be discriminated against in the same way. For example, a man from a rural area who has a good education but poor grammar may be looked down on by others. They may think he's not smart because of his grammar.\n\nSo, we have to work slowly and carefully to make change. We've made progress, and people are starting to accept women in charge and stay-at-home dads. But it's not easy, and it takes time.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it not a crime to have it. It's like a traffic ticket now. You can get in trouble, but it's not as bad as before.\n\nIf you get in trouble for marijuana, it can affect your life in some ways. It can affect your job and other things. This is a big problem for some people.\n\nBut some people say it's better to not make it a crime. It costs a lot to arrest and jail people. It costs money to bring them to court and to pay lawyers and judges.\n\nSome cities don't want to make this change. They don't want marijuana in their city. But some cities, like Denver, are different. They are more open to new ideas.\n\nIn Denver, they have more money now to spend on things like education and food for people who need it. This is good.\n\nMarijuana is not something we want everywhere. But it's also not something we want to ignore. There are good reasons to think about this issue carefully.\n\nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it and drive. That's a big problem. And some people would smoke it in public, and that would be awkward.\n\nAlcohol is bad for you too. It can affect your driving and your decisions. Marijuana can affect your lifestyle and your decisions too.\n\nNo two people react the same to substances. Some people can handle things well, and some people cannot. It's hard to know what to do.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol have bad effects. I think they should be treated carefully.",
            "I would say yes to changing the Catholic Church. \nBecause many of the things they do are old and do not change. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt is good to have traditions, but it is also important to change. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were married in a different church because my mom was Catholic and my dad was not. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. \nWe are taught to love others, but the Catholic Church does not act this way. \n\nI think some Catholic teachings are good, but the way the Church acts is not always right. \nThe Church continues to do things the old way, even if it is not good. \n\nI do not think that allowing priests to marry would stop them from being bad to children. \nPeople who harm children will do it no matter what. \nIt is not the same as being married to a spouse. \n\nSo, I do not think that allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is a difficult topic. The separation of church and state and the definition of marriage make it hard to decide without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know. I think that civil unions could be a good idea. Marriage is a sacrament for some people. If you are married, you should be equal in the eyes of the law. A civil union is just two people who are together.\n\nI think it is better to have a civil union instead of marriage. This way, the government does not have to get involved with the kind of marriage it is. The government should not care if people are baptized or not.\n\nI do not think that gay marriage should be a problem. It is two people who love each other and want to be together. They should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on something, it should be made into a federal law. A constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not necessary. It is a small issue and not big enough to change the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is not a big enough issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have gay friends. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I don't agree with all of its ideas. However, I think it should be allowed. It's not a national problem. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic. Some are republican. Democratic states will support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how they feel. I don't think you should disagree with their decision. You chose to live there.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, they should be allowed to marry based on each state's decision.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI don't think President Bush should make a decision about gay marriage for the whole country. Each state should decide its own rules.\n\nI don't think gay marriage should be banned. I think the president should not decide how each state runs itself. He doesn't live in every state. He should not decide for them.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president will not be in office for long. If a new president wants to change the law, it will be changed. But each state should decide its own rules. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't have any other answer.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials checking Myspace.  Myspace is a public website.  If you post something on it, others can see it.  This includes school officials.\n\nIf you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to keep it private.  It is easy to find things on the internet.  If you write something bad about someone, do not put it in an email.  Emails can come back to haunt you.\n\nOnce something is on the internet, it is always there.  If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.  School officials should not go on the internet just to catch students.  But if they find something that makes the school safer, that is okay.\n\nSchools have to keep students safe.  They have to be prepared for things like school shootings.  Schools have drills to prepare for emergencies.  School officials checked Myspace to keep the school safe.  They were not doing it just to catch students.\n\nWe had safety drills in my high school.  We practiced what to do in case of emergencies.  This was to keep the school safe.  School officials checked Myspace for the same reason.\n\nThey wanted to prevent a tragedy like Columbine.  I think that is a good reason to check Myspace.  That is all I have to say.",
            "I was for the war at first. I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help. But now I am against the war. We went to war without a plan. We did not think about the long-term effects. We did not prepare well.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. The people in that country are fighting with each other. They cannot be friends with us if they cannot be friends with themselves. I do not care about what happens there. They are fighting with each other and cannot take care of themselves.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are savage when they fight. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were looking for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war because people were angry. He declared war on Iraq without a plan. We did not have a choice, but we could have done it better. We should have had a clear plan to create order.\n\nWe did not work together. We did not know what we were doing. I think emotion and anger led us to war. That's what we created in that country. We are not the ones to change those people. They will always be like that.\n\nWe are not making enough progress. We made some progress, but it's not enough to stay. The country will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should just leave."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are losing interest in the Church. One reason is that the Church is not open to many things. For example, the Church has strong views on gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are not modern. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on these issues. The Church's views are old-fashioned. The Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same thing is true for gay marriage.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God and give their lives to the Church. But people in other jobs have families and other responsibilities. I do not see why priests cannot have these things too.",

They should not be blamed for how they are born.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide. It is not a matter of law or morality. It is just about treating people fairly. Gay people should not be blamed for how they are born. They should be allowed to live their lives like everyone else.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved. It has nothing to do with the country's safety. It is just about treating people fairly. They should not interfere in people's lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family. However, this is not true. It's a different kind of relationship. There are many different aspects to it, and it can't be compared to a traditional marriage.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. However, they are the same thing. \n\nThere are many civil rights that come with marriage, like taxes and health care. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. They're not considered family.\n\nI think this is silly. If you're going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany scientific studies have been done on this issue. They show that gay couples have the same kinds of relationships as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to happiness.\n\nIt's just a relationship. It's the same thing. People get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. Gay couples are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government gives civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in their relationships. People worry about adoption and community issues. They're concerned about how gay couples will affect the community and children.\n\nHowever, this is new and hard to understand. It's hard to say what will happen to children of gay couples. They may be treated badly by their peers or other adults.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. In public schools, they get beaten up. Parents protest to get their children removed from school.\n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not, just like anyone else.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. His views are not necessarily mine. Most of the reasons he gives are moral reasons. However, morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to ignore the morality of other groups and go along with what some religious groups believe. This is hypocritical, especially considering the controversy about the Pledge of Allegiance and \"under God.\"\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not true.\n\nIf people listened to experts and research, the world would be a different place.",
            "This summer I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I think a drug's legality does not mean it has good qualities. So, I think it is good to use marijuana for medical purposes, but not make it available to the public. We use many illegal drugs in pharmacies, like oxycodone and vicodin. They are good and safe when used correctly. If we do not use marijuana because it is not legal, then we are not giving its good qualities a chance. We should permit its use for medical reasons.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either substance, it can be bad for you. I think we should allow marijuana to be used, but we should do it slowly. If we make it legal too fast, people may use it too much. I think we should remove the bad image people have of marijuana. It is not as bad as some other drugs.\n\nIf people think marijuana is not so bad, they may use it responsibly. They can use it for medical reasons, and it might help people feel better.",
            "The Catholic Church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it once was. I grew up attending church every Sunday. I would wear a cute dress and matching shoes. It was a big deal. My friends and I would see each other there on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter mass, just thirty minutes, and people dress more casually. During the summer, some people even wear beach clothes. Families come late, and it is not a big deal.\n\nThe church I attend is changing. I don't know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change is that people dress more casually. It is not as formal as it used to be.\n\nI don't think the church could have prevented the accusations against priests. Some men become pedophiles, even if they are married. It is not the church's rules that cause this. If a man wants to be a priest, it is his choice. There are other religions that allow priests to be married. If they want to be married, they could consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is genetic. People are born with it. It is not something they become. They may try to hide it, but it will come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is shameful.

But that was not true. This made me very upset.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Even Colin Powell, who was a big part of the decision, said he was not sure of the evidence.\n\nI think it is wrong for a president to lie. It is a big mistake. The Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They wanted to do what they wanted, not what the law said.\n\nThe US went to war in Iraq with the intention of taking control. The Secretary of the Treasury wrote a book saying that President Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to remove Saddam Hussein because his father did not like him.

            "I do not think it is right for a state or the government to make marijuana legal. I believe it should be left to the churches. The Constitution says there should be separation of church and state. This is clear. We should not try to enforce laws about something that is against one church's rules if it is not against the rules of another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana use, except in some areas.\n\nThe idea of making marijuana illegal is a matter of church rules, not government rules. The Constitution allows for religious freedom. Some people wanted to change the Constitution to make it clear, but I do not think that is the right thing to do. It would be against what is already written.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. It allows for people to have different beliefs. If we change the Constitution, it would be wrong. It would also be the only amendment that would restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in making marijuana laws. I do not see why the president is pushing for a ban. He is a Catholic and it seems like he is trying to push his own beliefs on others. It is up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government. The president's push for a ban is just his own personal belief.\n\nI do not see how a ban would help the economy.

            "The war in Iraq started in 2003. I do not think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people to make them support the war.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was like the Vietnam War. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war. Many American soldiers died. Removing a country's government is not easy. The government was not prepared for the void of power and chaos that came after the war.\n\nThe US government tried to put a democratic government in place. This was also the goal in Vietnam. But the government should have known that it would be a long and hard process. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made it seem like it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. But it is not easy to implement a new form of government. Democracy was a long struggle in the US too.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. I wanted to let him finish what he started. But now I think the US should not abandon the people of Iraq. We took their government and way of life. We should see it through to the end. But there are many American casualties.\n\nI think the main reason we invaded Iraq was for the oil. We need oil, and Iraq has it. The US government is not honest about its reasons for going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade them.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. It is a personal preference, and it is something that research has shown is often biological, not just a result of how we are raised. \n\nI think it's wrong to deny people rights because of something they can't control. It's not fair or kind. I have always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal and private matter. It's not just about the state or the country, it's about individuals and families. \n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they can't. But they are like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like everyone else. \n\nI think it's wrong when the government tries to decide what marriage means. This is not just about the law, it's about people's lives. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nI've read that some people are born gay. It's a chemical thing in the brain. It's not just about how people are raised. For example, someone who grows up with many sisters and no brothers might be more likely to be gay.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that marriage is not a public event. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without announcing it to the world. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big deal. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't have any other reasons.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. As a resident assistant, I have dealt with this problem before. \n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you write about violence or shootings, people will think you are a threat. The internet is public. If someone sees something bad, they can tell a school official. The school has to act quickly. They cannot ignore a threat. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is serious and what is not. Some people just joke around online. You have to be careful. \n\nIn my school, someone overheard something that sounded serious. They called the school, and we found out who the person was.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe initial purpose was good - to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe father of the president who started the war had a problem with the leader of the country we were fighting. \nI think it's not fair to go to war for personal reasons. \nI believe we achieved our goal in the first few months of the war. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty and illness. \nWe should not spend so much money on a long war. \nThere are many important things we need to fix at home, like roads, schools, and health care. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe goal was good - to bring democracy to a country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty, illness, and schools. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be a long-term problem for us. \nWe have many other problems, like poverty, illness, and roads. \nWe should fix these problems at home, not spend money on a war. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nI think the money could be better spent on things that help our country. \n\nI think that's my opinion.",
            "I have a question about something that happened online. It seems that someone looked at a person's information on the internet and was able to stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nThis person found information on the internet because someone had made it available. They must have been friends with the person who posted the information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you have to think that many people will see them. You can't control who sees your information. So it's good that someone was able to find this information and help.\n\nBut it's also a problem. It's not fair to have one person watching everyone's information all the time. It's like treating some people differently. We can't have someone watching people all the time to make sure they're not doing something bad.\n\nIt's like having someone's job to look at people's information on the internet. That's not fair. But maybe it's okay if someone finds information by accident.\n\nI have a Facebook account, not Myspace. I know that some people can see my information. There are people who want to know things about me. They can find my screen name and talk to me on the internet. It's hard to know who these people are.\n\nYou can put some things on the internet, but you can also be careful. I try not to put too much information on my Facebook. But I also want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that didn't allow students to have Myspace. I don't think that's right. The school can't tell students what they can and can't do on the internet.\n\nThat's my thought on this issue.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it at first. But now it's not important to me anymore. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and around the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population think this. Eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want the US to leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before the US invasion. Now it's even worse. There is no easy way to solve problems in the Middle East. The US and Middle Eastern countries have big cultural differences. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries, but the people there might not want that.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought before invading his country. We made a big mistake. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand - it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. The government has not given a good reason to stay. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I wouldn't mind. But I think we should leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want the US to leave. They're the people we're trying to help. If they say we should go, we should listen. That way, we can't say we were not asked to leave.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but the Iraqis didn't want us to stay. At least we'll be the good guys. Well, not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \nIt's not just for women, though. I think it also depends on the job you're doing. \nWomen often have a harder time getting ahead because of the way society has been raised. \nEven though we are supposed to have equal rights, many people have trouble working for a woman if they are a man. \nThis is because of how things have been for a long time. \nIn many workplaces, women see a job they are qualified for, but are not chosen for it because it's not common for women to be in high positions. \nThe same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \nSociety often looks down on men who stay home with their children. \nThey should be the ones working and making money, right? \nThis can be hard for them because maybe they've always wanted to take care of their children. \nIf they are married, their wife may have a good job and be working. \nBut society doesn't understand this and looks down on men who stay home. \nIn the fashion industry, some people don't take men seriously if they are straight. \nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because men who like fashion often have a different style of life. \nIf a man is in fashion and has a typical life, people may wonder if he really knows about fashion or if he just follows what women like. \nIt depends on the job you're in, but I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States. \nChanging it is hard because society has a set way of thinking. \nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow. \nI think if we keep working at the pace we are now, women will continue to get more opportunities and become more accepted in business. \nMore men are also staying home with their children and being accepted. \nAs people see the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped, they will start to understand them better. \nWe don't need to be too pushy about it, but just show the good qualities of these people. \nIf we do it too fast, people will resist. \nWe're at a good balance now, and change takes time. \n\nI also think people are often discriminated against because of where they're from or how they speak. \nIf you grew up on a farm and didn't learn how to speak well, but you're very smart, you might still be able to get a good job. \nBut other men might look down on you because they think you might not be smart if you can't speak well. \nSo, yes, people can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their gender. \nThis is another example.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it less serious to get. Now it is like a traffic ticket. You get in trouble, but not as bad as before. You don't have to go to jail.\n\nPeople worry about the future. They don't want a record for something like this. Even if it is not a big deal now, it can still hurt them later.\n\nBut some people think it costs a lot to arrest people and take them to court. They say it is better to not do this and use the money for other things. Some cities are hurting financially, so they do not want to do this.\n\nOne city that changed the rules is Denver. People there are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. Now the city has more money to spend on things like education and food for people who need it.\n\nSome people are worried that if marijuana is legal, people will smoke it everywhere. They will drive and smoke. This is not good. And some people do not like the idea of marijuana being out in the open.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for driving. Marijuana can also be bad for people's lives. But people react differently to substances. Some people can handle them well. Others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But both marijuana and alcohol have bad effects.",
            "I agree. Here's why: Many things the Catholic Church does are very traditional. They do things the same way for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be flexible to change.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules exactly. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was an Episcopalian too. My mom was a Catholic, but they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. This is not very tolerant.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. I feel like some Catholic rules tell you to do things, but the way the Church practices goes against it. The rules are old-fashioned, but the Church continues to follow them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. If someone wants to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.\n\nPeople who hurt children will do it regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about the child, not the spouse. So, allowing priests to be married would not stop this from happening.",
            "I do not have a strong opinion on this issue. I am not sure if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult topic because it is close to the separation of church and state. It is also hard to define what marriage is without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a special union between two people. Some people think it is a sacrament. Others do not believe in a government definition of marriage. They think the government should not decide what kind of marriage is okay.\n\nIf two people get married, they should have the same rights as other married couples. They should not be treated unfairly. If the government gives tax breaks to married people, it should give them to all married couples, not just some.\n\nThe idea of gay marriage is that two people of the same sex can get married. Some people do not think this is right. But it is not a big enough issue to change the constitution. The constitution should not be changed just to ban gay marriage.\n\nIt is not important enough to make a law that says who can and cannot get married. The government should not decide who is married and who is not.\n\nI do not think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a good idea.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I have many gay friends, but I do not totally agree with that lifestyle. However, I believe it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national decision.\n\nI think a state should decide for itself whether to allow gay marriage. Many states are democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision.\n\nYou chose to live in that state. If you do not agree with the decision, you can move to a different state. I believe homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should be able to decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide what the whole country thinks about gay marriage. I believe it should be up to each state.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I think the president should not decide how each state should behave. He does not live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. President Bush will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nI do not have an opinion about that.",
            "I don't agree with the school officials looking at students' Myspace pages. If you post something on the internet, you know it will be seen by others. This includes school officials. They can still find out what you are doing even if your Myspace page is not under the school's name. They can look at it from their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is okay if they look at Myspace to prevent school shootings. If they can save lives, that is a good thing. School officials have a responsibility to keep students safe.\n\nIt is like when they check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to catch students who are doing something wrong. I think this is an invasion of privacy. But, if they can make the school a better and safer place, it is okay.\n\nEverything on the internet can be seen by others. If you post something on Myspace, it will be there forever. This can hurt you later in life. If you do something wrong, it can be hard to get out of trouble.\n\nSchool officials should not check Myspace just to catch students. But, if they have a reason, it is okay. Like when they make sure the school is safe. This is like when they practice lock downs to be ready for bad things to happen.\n\nThey did this to prepare for something like the Columbine school shooting. They wanted to keep students safe. I think this is what school officials were doing in this case. They were making the school a safer place.",
            "I was for the war in Iraq at first. I thought it was a good idea to go there after nine eleven. But now I am against it. I think we had no plan and were not prepared.\n\nWe went to Iraq because of anger and emotion, not because we thought about the long-term effects. We did not think about what would happen after we arrived. As a result, things did not go well.\n\nThe people in Iraq fight among themselves. They cannot work together. If they fight each other, they cannot fight against us. We went to Iraq to help, but we are not making a difference. We are actually hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They use strong methods and are not interested in making their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nWe went to Iraq looking for revenge. We wanted to punish them for what happened on nine eleven. But we should have thought about the consequences. We should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe cannot change the people in Iraq. They will always be the same. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. When we leave, things will get worse. So, it is better for us to leave now.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. We are not doing enough good to stay in Iraq. We should just leave and stop hurting ourselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are losing interest in the Church. One reason is that the Church is not open to many things. For example, the Church has strong views on gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are not modern. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on these issues. The Church's views are old-fashioned. The Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same thing is true for gay marriage.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God and give their lives to the Church. But people in other jobs have families and other responsibilities. I do not see why priests cannot have these things too.",

They should not be blamed for how they are born.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide. It is not a matter of law or morality. It is just about treating people fairly. Gay people should not be blamed for how they are born. They should be allowed to live their lives like everyone else.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved. It has nothing to do with the country's safety. It is just about treating people fairly. They should not interfere in people's lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family. However, this is not true. It's a different kind of relationship. There are many different aspects to it, and it can't be compared to a traditional marriage.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. However, they are the same thing. \n\nThere are many civil rights that come with marriage, like taxes and health care. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. They're not considered family.\n\nI think this is silly. If you're going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany scientific studies have been done on this issue. They show that gay couples have the same kinds of relationships as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to happiness.\n\nIt's just a relationship. It's the same thing. People get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. Gay couples are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government gives civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in their relationships. People worry about adoption and community issues. They're concerned about how gay couples will affect the community and children.\n\nHowever, this is new and hard to understand. It's hard to say what will happen to children of gay couples. They may be treated badly by their peers or other adults.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. In public schools, they get beaten up. Parents protest to get their children removed from school.\n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not, just like anyone else.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. His views are not necessarily mine. Most of the reasons he gives are moral reasons. However, morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to ignore the morality of other groups and go along with what some religious groups believe. This is hypocritical, especially considering the controversy about the Pledge of Allegiance and \"under God.\"\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not true.\n\nIf people listened to experts and research, the world would be a different place.",
            "This summer I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I think a drug's legality does not mean it has good qualities. So, I think it is good to use marijuana for medical purposes, but not make it available to the public. We use many illegal drugs in pharmacies, like oxycodone and vicodin. They are good and safe when used correctly. If we do not use marijuana because it is not legal, then we are not giving its good qualities a chance. We should permit its use for medical reasons.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either substance, it can be bad for you. I think we should allow marijuana to be used, but we should do it slowly. If we make it legal too fast, people may use it too much. I think we should remove the bad image people have of marijuana. It is not as bad as some other drugs.\n\nIf people think marijuana is not so bad, they may use it responsibly. They can use it for medical reasons, and it might help people feel better.",
            "The Catholic Church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it once was. I grew up attending church every Sunday. I would wear a cute dress and matching shoes. It was a big deal. My friends and I would see each other there on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter mass, just thirty minutes, and people dress more casually. During the summer, some people even wear beach clothes. Families come late, and it is not a big deal.\n\nThe church I attend is changing. I don't know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change is that people dress more casually. It is not as formal as it used to be.\n\nI don't think the church could have prevented the accusations against priests. Some men become pedophiles, even if they are married. It is not the church's rules that cause this. If a man wants to be a priest, it is his choice. There are other religions that allow priests to be married. If they want to be married, they could consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is genetic. People are born with it. It is not something they become. They may try to hide it, but it will come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is shameful.

But that was not true. This made me very upset.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Even Colin Powell, who was a big part of the decision, said he was not sure of the evidence.\n\nI think it is wrong for a president to lie. It is a big mistake. The Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They wanted to do what they wanted, not what the law said.\n\nThe US went to war in Iraq with the intention of taking control. The Secretary of the Treasury wrote a book saying that President Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to remove Saddam Hussein because his father did not like him.

            "I do not think it is right for a state or the government to make marijuana legal. I believe it should be left to the churches. The Constitution says there should be separation of church and state. This is clear. We should not try to enforce laws about something that is against one church's rules if it is not against the rules of another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana use, except in some areas.\n\nThe idea of making marijuana illegal is a matter of church rules, not government rules. The Constitution allows for religious freedom. Some people wanted to change the Constitution to make it clear, but I do not think that is the right thing to do. It would be against what is already written.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. It allows for people to have different beliefs. If we change the Constitution, it would be wrong. It would also be the only amendment that would restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in making marijuana laws. I do not see why the president is pushing for a ban. He is a Catholic and it seems like he is trying to push his own beliefs on others. It is up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government. The president's push for a ban is just his own personal belief.\n\nI do not see how a ban would help the economy.

            "The war in Iraq started in 2003. I do not think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people to make them support the war.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was like the Vietnam War. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war. Many American soldiers died. Removing a country's government is not easy. The government was not prepared for the void of power and chaos that came after the war.\n\nThe US government tried to put a democratic government in place. This was also the goal in Vietnam. But the government should have known that it would be a long and hard process. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made it seem like it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. But it is not easy to implement a new form of government. Democracy was a long struggle in the US too.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. I wanted to let him finish what he started. But now I think the US should not abandon the people of Iraq. We took their government and way of life. We should see it through to the end. But there are many American casualties.\n\nI think the main reason we invaded Iraq was for the oil. We need oil, and Iraq has it. The US government is not honest about its reasons for going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade them.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. It is a personal preference, and it is something that research has shown is often biological, not just a result of how we are raised. \n\nI think it's wrong to deny people rights because of something they can't control. It's not fair or kind. I have always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal and private matter. It's not just about the state or the country, it's about individuals and families. \n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they can't. But they are like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like everyone else. \n\nI think it's wrong when the government tries to decide what marriage means. This is not just about the law, it's about people's lives. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nI've read that some people are born gay. It's a chemical thing in the brain. It's not just about how people are raised. For example, someone who grows up with many sisters and no brothers might be more likely to be gay.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that marriage is not a public event. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without announcing it to the world. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big deal. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't have any other reasons.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. As a resident assistant, I have dealt with this problem before. \n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you write about violence or shootings, people will think you are a threat. The internet is public. If someone sees something bad, they can tell a school official. The school has to act quickly. They cannot ignore a threat. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is serious and what is not. Some people just joke around online. You have to be careful. \n\nIn my school, someone overheard something that sounded serious. They called the school, and we found out who the person was.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe initial purpose was good - to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe father of the president who started the war had a problem with the leader of the country we were fighting. \nI think it's not fair to go to war for personal reasons. \nI believe we achieved our goal in the first few months of the war. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty and illness. \nWe should not spend so much money on a long war. \nThere are many important things we need to fix at home, like roads, schools, and health care. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe goal was good - to bring democracy to a country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty, illness, and schools. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be a long-term problem for us. \nWe have many other problems, like poverty, illness, and roads. \nWe should fix these problems at home, not spend money on a war. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nI think the money could be better spent on things that help our country. \n\nI think that's my opinion.",
            "I have a question about something that happened online. It seems that someone looked at a person's information on the internet and was able to stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nThis person found information on the internet because someone had made it available. They must have been friends with the person who posted the information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you have to think that many people will see them. You can't control who sees your information. So it's good that someone was able to find this information and help.\n\nBut it's also a problem. It's not fair to have one person watching everyone's information all the time. It's like treating some people differently. We can't have someone watching people all the time to make sure they're not doing something bad.\n\nIt's like having someone's job to look at people's information on the internet. That's not fair. But maybe it's okay if someone finds information by accident.\n\nI have a Facebook account, not Myspace. I know that some people can see my information. There are people who want to know things about me. They can find my screen name and talk to me on the internet. It's hard to know who these people are.\n\nYou can put some things on the internet, but you can also be careful. I try not to put too much information on my Facebook. But I also want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that didn't allow students to have Myspace. I don't think that's right. The school can't tell students what they can and can't do on the internet.\n\nThat's my thought on this issue.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it at first. But now it's not important to me anymore. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and around the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population think this. Eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want the US to leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before the US invasion. Now it's even worse. There is no easy way to solve problems in the Middle East. The US and Middle Eastern countries have big cultural differences. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries, but the people there might not want that.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought before invading his country. We made a big mistake. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand - it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. The government has not given a good reason to stay. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I wouldn't mind. But I think we should leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want the US to leave. They're the people we're trying to help. If they say we should go, we should listen. That way, we can't say we were not asked to leave.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but the Iraqis didn't want us to stay. At least we'll be the good guys. Well, not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \nIt's not just for women, though. I think it also depends on the job you're doing. \nWomen often have a harder time getting ahead because of the way society has been raised. \nEven though we are supposed to have equal rights, many people have trouble working for a woman if they are a man. \nThis is because of how things have been for a long time. \nIn many workplaces, women see a job they are qualified for, but are not chosen for it because it's not common for women to be in high positions. \nThe same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \nSociety often looks down on men who stay home with their children. \nThey should be the ones working and making money, right? \nThis can be hard for them because maybe they've always wanted to take care of their children. \nIf they are married, their wife may have a good job and be working. \nBut society doesn't understand this and looks down on men who stay home. \nIn the fashion industry, some people don't take men seriously if they are straight. \nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because men who like fashion often have a different style of life. \nIf a man is in fashion and has a typical life, people may wonder if he really knows about fashion or if he just follows what women like. \nIt depends on the job you're in, but I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States. \nChanging it is hard because society has a set way of thinking. \nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow. \nI think if we keep working at the pace we are now, women will continue to get more opportunities and become more accepted in business. \nMore men are also staying home with their children and being accepted. \nAs people see the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped, they will start to understand them better. \nWe don't need to be too pushy about it, but just show the good qualities of these people. \nIf we do it too fast, people will resist. \nWe're at a good balance now, and change takes time. \n\nI also think people are often discriminated against because of where they're from or how they speak. \nIf you grew up on a farm and didn't learn how to speak well, but you're very smart, you might still be able to get a good job. \nBut other men might look down on you because they think you might not be smart if you can't speak well. \nSo, yes, people can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their gender. \nThis is another example.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it less serious to get. Now it is like a traffic ticket. You get in trouble, but not as bad as before. You don't have to go to jail.\n\nPeople worry about the future. They don't want a record for something like this. Even if it is not a big deal now, it can still hurt them later.\n\nBut some people think it costs a lot to arrest people and take them to court. They say it is better to not do this and use the money for other things. Some cities are hurting financially, so they do not want to do this.\n\nOne city that changed the rules is Denver. People there are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. Now the city has more money to spend on things like education and food for people who need it.\n\nSome people are worried that if marijuana is legal, people will smoke it everywhere. They will drive and smoke. This is not good. And some people do not like the idea of marijuana being out in the open.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for driving. Marijuana can also be bad for people's lives. But people react differently to substances. Some people can handle them well. Others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But both marijuana and alcohol have bad effects.",
            "I agree. Here's why: Many things the Catholic Church does are very traditional. They do things the same way for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be flexible to change.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules exactly. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was an Episcopalian too. My mom was a Catholic, but they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. This is not very tolerant.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. I feel like some Catholic rules tell you to do things, but the way the Church practices goes against it. The rules are old-fashioned, but the Church continues to follow them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. If someone wants to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.\n\nPeople who hurt children will do it regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about the child, not the spouse. So, allowing priests to be married would not stop this from happening.",
            "I do not have a strong opinion on this issue. I am not sure if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult topic because it is close to the separation of church and state. It is also hard to define what marriage is without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a special union between two people. Some people think it is a sacrament. Others do not believe in a government definition of marriage. They think the government should not decide what kind of marriage is okay.\n\nIf two people get married, they should have the same rights as other married couples. They should not be treated unfairly. If the government gives tax breaks to married people, it should give them to all married couples, not just some.\n\nThe idea of gay marriage is that two people of the same sex can get married. Some people do not think this is right. But it is not a big enough issue to change the constitution. The constitution should not be changed just to ban gay marriage.\n\nIt is not important enough to make a law that says who can and cannot get married. The government should not decide who is married and who is not.\n\nI do not think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a good idea.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I have many gay friends, but I do not totally agree with that lifestyle. However, I believe it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national decision.\n\nI think a state should decide for itself whether to allow gay marriage. Many states are democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision.\n\nYou chose to live in that state. If you do not agree with the decision, you can move to a different state. I believe homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should be able to decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide what the whole country thinks about gay marriage. I believe it should be up to each state.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I think the president should not decide how each state should behave. He does not live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. President Bush will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nI do not have an opinion about that.",
            "I don't agree with the school officials looking at students' Myspace pages. If you post something on the internet, you know it will be seen by others. This includes school officials. They can still find out what you are doing even if your Myspace page is not under the school's name. They can look at it from their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is okay if they look at Myspace to prevent school shootings. If they can save lives, that is a good thing. School officials have a responsibility to keep students safe.\n\nIt is like when they check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to catch students who are doing something wrong. I think this is an invasion of privacy. But, if they can make the school a better and safer place, it is okay.\n\nEverything on the internet can be seen by others. If you post something on Myspace, it will be there forever. This can hurt you later in life. If you do something wrong, it can be hard to get out of trouble.\n\nSchool officials should not check Myspace just to catch students. But, if they have a reason, it is okay. Like when they make sure the school is safe. This is like when they practice lock downs to be ready for bad things to happen.\n\nThey did this to prepare for something like the Columbine school shooting. They wanted to keep students safe. I think this is what school officials were doing in this case. They were making the school a safer place.",
            "I was for the war in Iraq at first. I thought it was a good idea to go there after nine eleven. But now I am against it. I think we had no plan and were not prepared.\n\nWe went to Iraq because of anger and emotion, not because we thought about the long-term effects. We did not think about what would happen after we arrived. As a result, things did not go well.\n\nThe people in Iraq fight among themselves. They cannot work together. If they fight each other, they cannot fight against us. We went to Iraq to help, but we are not making a difference. We are actually hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They use strong methods and are not interested in making their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nWe went to Iraq looking for revenge. We wanted to punish them for what happened on nine eleven. But we should have thought about the consequences. We should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe cannot change the people in Iraq. They will always be the same. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. When we leave, things will get worse. So, it is better for us to leave now.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. We are not doing enough good to stay in Iraq. We should just leave and stop hurting ourselves."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are losing interest in the Church. One reason is that the Church is not open to many things. For example, the Church has strong views on gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are not modern. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on these issues. The Church's views are old-fashioned. The Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same thing is true for gay marriage.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God and give their lives to the Church. But people in other jobs have families and other responsibilities. I do not see why priests cannot have these things too.",

They should not be blamed for how they are born.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide. It is not a matter of law or morality. It is just about treating people fairly. Gay people should not be blamed for how they are born. They should be allowed to live their lives like everyone else.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved. It has nothing to do with the country's safety. It is just about treating people fairly. They should not interfere in people's lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that homosexual couples threaten the traditional family. However, this is not true. It's a different kind of relationship. There are many different aspects to it, and it can't be compared to a traditional marriage.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails. However, they are the same thing. \n\nThere are many civil rights that come with marriage, like taxes and health care. If you're in a gay couple, your partner can't be with you in the hospital or visit you if you're sick. They're not considered family.\n\nI think this is silly. If you're going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany scientific studies have been done on this issue. They show that gay couples have the same kinds of relationships as heterosexual couples. They have the same factors that contribute to happiness.\n\nIt's just a relationship. It's the same thing. People get hung up on the idea of marriage in a church. Gay couples are not asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government.\n\nIf the government gives civil unions, why not marriage? It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nGay couples are the same in many ways. They have the same roles in their relationships. People worry about adoption and community issues. They're concerned about how gay couples will affect the community and children.\n\nHowever, this is new and hard to understand. It's hard to say what will happen to children of gay couples. They may be treated badly by their peers or other adults.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. In public schools, they get beaten up. Parents protest to get their children removed from school.\n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples. They can be community involved or not, just like anyone else.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue, based on his religion. His views are not necessarily mine. Most of the reasons he gives are moral reasons. However, morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to ignore the morality of other groups and go along with what some religious groups believe. This is hypocritical, especially considering the controversy about the Pledge of Allegiance and \"under God.\"\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they believe that gay people are psychologically damaged or have a personality defect. However, this is not true. The American Psychological Association has said that this is not true.\n\nIf people listened to experts and research, the world would be a different place.",
            "This summer I worked in a hospital pharmacy. I think a drug's legality does not mean it has good qualities. So, I think it is good to use marijuana for medical purposes, but not make it available to the public. We use many illegal drugs in pharmacies, like oxycodone and vicodin. They are good and safe when used correctly. If we do not use marijuana because it is not legal, then we are not giving its good qualities a chance. We should permit its use for medical reasons.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you use too much of either substance, it can be bad for you. I think we should allow marijuana to be used, but we should do it slowly. If we make it legal too fast, people may use it too much. I think we should remove the bad image people have of marijuana. It is not as bad as some other drugs.\n\nIf people think marijuana is not so bad, they may use it responsibly. They can use it for medical reasons, and it might help people feel better.",
            "The Catholic Church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it once was. I grew up attending church every Sunday. I would wear a cute dress and matching shoes. It was a big deal. My friends and I would see each other there on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter mass, just thirty minutes, and people dress more casually. During the summer, some people even wear beach clothes. Families come late, and it is not a big deal.\n\nThe church I attend is changing. I don't know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change is that people dress more casually. It is not as formal as it used to be.\n\nI don't think the church could have prevented the accusations against priests. Some men become pedophiles, even if they are married. It is not the church's rules that cause this. If a man wants to be a priest, it is his choice. There are other religions that allow priests to be married. If they want to be married, they could consider a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is genetic. People are born with it. It is not something they become. They may try to hide it, but it will come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is shameful.

But that was not true. This made me very upset.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Even Colin Powell, who was a big part of the decision, said he was not sure of the evidence.\n\nI think it is wrong for a president to lie. It is a big mistake. The Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They wanted to do what they wanted, not what the law said.\n\nThe US went to war in Iraq with the intention of taking control. The Secretary of the Treasury wrote a book saying that President Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to remove Saddam Hussein because his father did not like him.

            "I do not think it is right for a state or the government to make marijuana legal. I believe it should be left to the churches. The Constitution says there should be separation of church and state. This is clear. We should not try to enforce laws about something that is against one church's rules if it is not against the rules of another. Most Catholics and Christians do not support marijuana use, except in some areas.\n\nThe idea of making marijuana illegal is a matter of church rules, not government rules. The Constitution allows for religious freedom. Some people wanted to change the Constitution to make it clear, but I do not think that is the right thing to do. It would be against what is already written.\n\nThe separation of church and state is a key part of the Constitution. It allows for people to have different beliefs. If we change the Constitution, it would be wrong. It would also be the only amendment that would restrict the people, not the government.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in making marijuana laws. I do not see why the president is pushing for a ban. He is a Catholic and it seems like he is trying to push his own beliefs on others. It is up to the churches to decide this issue, not the government. The president's push for a ban is just his own personal belief.\n\nI do not see how a ban would help the economy.

            "The war in Iraq started in 2003. I do not think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked it to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people to make them support the war.\n\nI am against war, especially a preemptive strike. The war in Iraq was like the Vietnam War. The government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war. Many American soldiers died. Removing a country's government is not easy. The government was not prepared for the void of power and chaos that came after the war.\n\nThe US government tried to put a democratic government in place. This was also the goal in Vietnam. But the government should have known that it would be a long and hard process. The US government should have planned for all possible outcomes.\n\nI think the government was not honest with the American people about the war. They made it seem like it would be a short and successful stay in Iraq. But it is not easy to implement a new form of government. Democracy was a long struggle in the US too.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for George Bush. I wanted to let him finish what he started. But now I think the US should not abandon the people of Iraq. We took their government and way of life. We should see it through to the end. But there are many American casualties.\n\nI think the main reason we invaded Iraq was for the oil. We need oil, and Iraq has it. The US government is not honest about its reasons for going to war. They said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were found. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade them.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and there will be peace in Iraq.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. It is a personal preference, and it is something that research has shown is often biological, not just a result of how we are raised. \n\nI think it's wrong to deny people rights because of something they can't control. It's not fair or kind. I have always been an advocate for gay marriage.\n\nI don't think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal and private matter. It's not just about the state or the country, it's about individuals and families. \n\nIn my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they can't. But they are like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like everyone else. \n\nI think it's wrong when the government tries to decide what marriage means. This is not just about the law, it's about people's lives. It's kind of ridiculous.\n\nI've read that some people are born gay. It's a chemical thing in the brain. It's not just about how people are raised. For example, someone who grows up with many sisters and no brothers might be more likely to be gay.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that marriage is not a public event. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without announcing it to the world. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big deal. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I don't have any other reasons.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. As a resident assistant, I have dealt with this problem before. \n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you write about violence or shootings, people will think you are a threat. The internet is public. If someone sees something bad, they can tell a school official. The school has to act quickly. They cannot ignore a threat. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is serious and what is not. Some people just joke around online. You have to be careful. \n\nIn my school, someone overheard something that sounded serious. They called the school, and we found out who the person was.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe initial purpose was good - to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe father of the president who started the war had a problem with the leader of the country we were fighting. \nI think it's not fair to go to war for personal reasons. \nI believe we achieved our goal in the first few months of the war. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty and illness. \nWe should not spend so much money on a long war. \nThere are many important things we need to fix at home, like roads, schools, and health care. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe goal was good - to bring democracy to a country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nNow, it seems like we are fighting just to show our power. \nI also think the reasons for the war were not fair from the start. \nThe war has lasted for many years. \nI think it's time to stop the war. \nThe country's government should take care of itself now. \nWe should spend our money on our own problems, like poverty, illness, and schools. \nWe should use our money for these things, not for a war that has no clear end. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be a long-term problem for us. \nWe have many other problems, like poverty, illness, and roads. \nWe should fix these problems at home, not spend money on a war. \nMany of our citizens are dying in this war. \nI think the money could be better spent on things that help our country. \n\nI think that's my opinion.",
            "I have a question about something that happened online. It seems that someone looked at a person's information on the internet and was able to stop a bad thing from happening.\n\nThis person found information on the internet because someone had made it available. They must have been friends with the person who posted the information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you have to think that many people will see them. You can't control who sees your information. So it's good that someone was able to find this information and help.\n\nBut it's also a problem. It's not fair to have one person watching everyone's information all the time. It's like treating some people differently. We can't have someone watching people all the time to make sure they're not doing something bad.\n\nIt's like having someone's job to look at people's information on the internet. That's not fair. But maybe it's okay if someone finds information by accident.\n\nI have a Facebook account, not Myspace. I know that some people can see my information. There are people who want to know things about me. They can find my screen name and talk to me on the internet. It's hard to know who these people are.\n\nYou can put some things on the internet, but you can also be careful. I try not to put too much information on my Facebook. But I also want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that didn't allow students to have Myspace. I don't think that's right. The school can't tell students what they can and can't do on the internet.\n\nThat's my thought on this issue.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it at first. But now it's not important to me anymore. Most people in the United States, Iraq, and around the world think it was a bad idea. \n\nSeventy-five to eighty percent of the world's population think this. Eighty percent of Iraqis and seventy percent of US troops in Iraq think it was a bad idea. They want the US to leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before the US invasion. Now it's even worse. There is no easy way to solve problems in the Middle East. The US and Middle Eastern countries have big cultural differences. The US thinks it can bring democracy to these countries, but the people there might not want that.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought before invading his country. We made a big mistake. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand - it's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. The government has not given a good reason to stay. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I wouldn't mind. But I think we should leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want the US to leave. They're the people we're trying to help. If they say we should go, we should listen. That way, we can't say we were not asked to leave.\n\nIf we leave and things get worse, we can say we tried to help but the Iraqis didn't want us to stay. At least we'll be the good guys. Well, not really, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. \nIt's not just for women, though. I think it also depends on the job you're doing. \nWomen often have a harder time getting ahead because of the way society has been raised. \nEven though we are supposed to have equal rights, many people have trouble working for a woman if they are a man. \nThis is because of how things have been for a long time. \nIn many workplaces, women see a job they are qualified for, but are not chosen for it because it's not common for women to be in high positions. \nThe same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. \nSociety often looks down on men who stay home with their children. \nThey should be the ones working and making money, right? \nThis can be hard for them because maybe they've always wanted to take care of their children. \nIf they are married, their wife may have a good job and be working. \nBut society doesn't understand this and looks down on men who stay home. \nIn the fashion industry, some people don't take men seriously if they are straight. \nI'm not sure if this makes sense, but I think it's because men who like fashion often have a different style of life. \nIf a man is in fashion and has a typical life, people may wonder if he really knows about fashion or if he just follows what women like. \nIt depends on the job you're in, but I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States. \nChanging it is hard because society has a set way of thinking. \nWe've come a long way since the 1800s, but change is slow. \nI think if we keep working at the pace we are now, women will continue to get more opportunities and become more accepted in business. \nMore men are also staying home with their children and being accepted. \nAs people see the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped, they will start to understand them better. \nWe don't need to be too pushy about it, but just show the good qualities of these people. \nIf we do it too fast, people will resist. \nWe're at a good balance now, and change takes time. \n\nI also think people are often discriminated against because of where they're from or how they speak. \nIf you grew up on a farm and didn't learn how to speak well, but you're very smart, you might still be able to get a good job. \nBut other men might look down on you because they think you might not be smart if you can't speak well. \nSo, yes, people can be discriminated against because of where they're from or their gender. \nThis is another example.",
            "They did not make marijuana legal. They made it less serious to get. Now it is like a traffic ticket. You get in trouble, but not as bad as before. You don't have to go to jail.\n\nPeople worry about the future. They don't want a record for something like this. Even if it is not a big deal now, it can still hurt them later.\n\nBut some people think it costs a lot to arrest people and take them to court. They say it is better to not do this and use the money for other things. Some cities are hurting financially, so they do not want to do this.\n\nOne city that changed the rules is Denver. People there are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea. Now the city has more money to spend on things like education and food for people who need it.\n\nSome people are worried that if marijuana is legal, people will smoke it everywhere. They will drive and smoke. This is not good. And some people do not like the idea of marijuana being out in the open.\n\nAlcohol can be bad for driving. Marijuana can also be bad for people's lives. But people react differently to substances. Some people can handle them well. Others cannot.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But both marijuana and alcohol have bad effects.",
            "I agree. Here's why: Many things the Catholic Church does are very traditional. They do things the same way for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition, but it's also important to be flexible to change.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I feel like the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules exactly. They don't accept people who aren't perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian, and my dad was an Episcopalian too. My mom was a Catholic, but they wouldn't marry my parents in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. This is not very tolerant.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. I feel like some Catholic rules tell you to do things, but the way the Church practices goes against it. The rules are old-fashioned, but the Church continues to follow them.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. If someone wants to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's not about being married or not. It's about the person themselves.\n\nPeople who hurt children will do it regardless of whether they're married or not. It's about the child, not the spouse. So, allowing priests to be married would not stop this from happening.",
            "I do not have a strong opinion on this issue. I am not sure if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult topic because it is close to the separation of church and state. It is also hard to define what marriage is without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a special union between two people. Some people think it is a sacrament. Others do not believe in a government definition of marriage. They think the government should not decide what kind of marriage is okay.\n\nIf two people get married, they should have the same rights as other married couples. They should not be treated unfairly. If the government gives tax breaks to married people, it should give them to all married couples, not just some.\n\nThe idea of gay marriage is that two people of the same sex can get married. Some people do not think this is right. But it is not a big enough issue to change the constitution. The constitution should not be changed just to ban gay marriage.\n\nIt is not important enough to make a law that says who can and cannot get married. The government should not decide who is married and who is not.\n\nI do not think a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is a good idea.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a difficult issue for me. I have many gay friends, but I do not totally agree with that lifestyle. However, I believe it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national decision.\n\nI think a state should decide for itself whether to allow gay marriage. Many states are democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states will likely support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision.\n\nYou chose to live in that state. If you do not agree with the decision, you can move to a different state. I believe homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should be able to decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that question. I do not think President Bush should decide what the whole country thinks about gay marriage. I believe it should be up to each state.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. I think the president should not decide how each state should behave. He does not live in every state.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each individual state. President Bush will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nI do not have an opinion about that.",
            "I don't agree with the school officials looking at students' Myspace pages. If you post something on the internet, you know it will be seen by others. This includes school officials. They can still find out what you are doing even if your Myspace page is not under the school's name. They can look at it from their homes.\n\nBut, I think it is okay if they look at Myspace to prevent school shootings. If they can save lives, that is a good thing. School officials have a responsibility to keep students safe.\n\nIt is like when they check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing. They do this to catch students who are doing something wrong. I think this is an invasion of privacy. But, if they can make the school a better and safer place, it is okay.\n\nEverything on the internet can be seen by others. If you post something on Myspace, it will be there forever. This can hurt you later in life. If you do something wrong, it can be hard to get out of trouble.\n\nSchool officials should not check Myspace just to catch students. But, if they have a reason, it is okay. Like when they make sure the school is safe. This is like when they practice lock downs to be ready for bad things to happen.\n\nThey did this to prepare for something like the Columbine school shooting. They wanted to keep students safe. I think this is what school officials were doing in this case. They were making the school a safer place.",
            "I was for the war in Iraq at first. I thought it was a good idea to go there after nine eleven. But now I am against it. I think we had no plan and were not prepared.\n\nWe went to Iraq because of anger and emotion, not because we thought about the long-term effects. We did not think about what would happen after we arrived. As a result, things did not go well.\n\nThe people in Iraq fight among themselves. They cannot work together. If they fight each other, they cannot fight against us. We went to Iraq to help, but we are not making a difference. We are actually hurting ourselves by staying there.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They use strong methods and are not interested in making their country better. They just want us to leave.\n\nWe went to Iraq looking for revenge. We wanted to punish them for what happened on nine eleven. But we should have thought about the consequences. We should have had a clear plan.\n\nWe cannot change the people in Iraq. They will always be the same. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. When we leave, things will get worse. So, it is better for us to leave now.\n\nWe have made some progress, but it is not enough. We are not doing enough good to stay in Iraq. We should just leave and stop hurting ourselves."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

If the Church changes its views, it will not lose its followers.\n\nSome people are against the Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not allow women to be priests and priests cannot be married. Many people think this is unfair. They believe everyone should have their own family and life outside of their job.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but they do not need a family. However, this is not true for everyone else. Most people have jobs and families. They must balance work and family life. Priests should be able to do the same. \n\nThe Church needs to be more open-minded and accept different views. This will help it keep its followers. The Church should not be against things that many people support, like gay marriage and birth control.\n\nIf the Church allows priests to be married and have families, it might not have had some problems. However, it is hard to know for sure. The Church's rules are very old and do not fit with modern society.\n\nIn the end, the Church should be more accepting of different views and allow priests to be married and have families.

It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but they are the same thing.\n\nGay couples have many of the same rights as others. They should be able to own property and get medical help when they are sick. But now, they can't be with their partner in the hospital.\n\nThis is not fair. A lot of scientific studies have been done on gay couples and they are just like other couples. They have the same things that make a relationship successful.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to let gay couples get married. They think it's against their religion. But the government should not be involved in church business. If a gay couple wants a marriage certificate, that's all they are asking for.\n\nJust like the civil rights movement, this is about being separate but equal. Gay couples are the same as others in many ways.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how it will affect the community. But this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They can be parents just like anyone else.\n\nChildren of gay couples are just like other children. They are influenced by their parents, but their parents' sexual orientation does not affect their parenting skills.\n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not right.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage. He thinks it's against his religion. But his views are not the only ones that matter. Morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to enforce one group's morality on the whole country. The government should be fair and equal for everyone.\n\nSome people believe that gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just what our friends and neighbors think. If we do, we will see the world in a different way.",

I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. After I moved to a private school, I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend church together.\n\nNow, as I've grown older, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter service, thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some families come to church in beach clothes. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is in the church I attend. I don't know much about the church's politics, but this is my experience.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic church of not doing enough to stop priests who commit pedophilia. People think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to get married, these problems might have been avoided.\n\nI don't think this would have made a difference. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's the person, not the rules that cause the problem. When someone decides to become a priest, it's their choice. There are other religions that allow priests to get married, so if they want to get married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with it, not made that way through upbringing. You can't change it by getting married. It may come out eventually. I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.\n\nI don't have other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

Before we invaded Iraq, they said the war was about the September 11th terrorist attacks. But in reality, the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people after the attack to make the war seem necessary.\n\nI am against war and this one was no exception. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War in some ways. Both were long and difficult. The US government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war in Iraq. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government and tried to put in a new one. But this was a hard and long process.\n\nI do not think the US government was prepared for the problems it would face in Iraq. They should have learned from past mistakes.

They made it seem like it would be an easy thing to do.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do now. We have been in Iraq for a long time and it is hard to leave. We took away their government and their way of life. But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are still dying. The US government should have thought more about the consequences of going to war.\n\nI think the main reason for invading Iraq was to control their oil. This is one reason why we are not helping other countries become democratic.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq. But this does not seem likely.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal choice and not something that should be limited by laws. Many studies show that being gay is not a choice, but a biological fact. It is not something a person can control.\n\nI do not think politics and government should interfere with this issue. It is a personal and private matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they cannot be. However, they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. Marriage is a personal relationship between two people, not something that the government should define.\n\nStudies have shown that being gay is often a result of a chemical difference in the brain. It is something a person is born with and not something they choose. This is different from growing up in a certain way or being raised in a certain environment.\n\nIf two people, a man and a woman, want to get married, they can do so privately without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something that is made public.\n\nI am not for or against anything else about gay marriage.

They cannot ignore it. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. They may say things they do not mean. We had a situation at school like this. It was an experiment for a class. But it could be serious. Recently, something happened because someone overheard a student saying something in school.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe original goal was good, to help another country have democracy. \nBut I think we lost sight of that goal a long time ago. \nNow we are fighting just to show we are strong. \nI don't think the reasons were good from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf our goal was to help a country without a fair government, that would have been good. \nBut I think we have been fighting for too long. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut now we have been fighting for years. \n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that would have been a good reason for the war. \nBut I don't think that is our reason anymore. \nIt seems we are fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to end the war without winning. \n\nI think the war should end. \nTheir government should take care of itself. \nWe are spending a lot of money on the war. \nWe have our own problems, like poverty and poor roads. \nWe should spend money on those things. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \n\nWe spend billions of dollars on the war. \nWe have many problems at home that need money. \nThings like schools, roads and health care need money. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important. \n\nThat's my opinion.",
            "Do you think it is right for schools to prevent students from having Myspace accounts? This is a question I want to ask.\n\nI was thinking about this because someone found out about something on the internet. They looked at your Myspace and found out that you were in trouble. They were able to help prevent a bad thing from happening. I think this is good.\n\nBut then I started thinking, how do they know what to look for? If they are just looking at everyone's Myspace, it might not be fair. They might be looking at the wrong people. And it might be like profiling. They might be looking for bad people, but they might not be fair.\n\nI don't think it is right for someone to have a job to look at everyone's Myspace all day. But I also think it is good that someone was able to help prevent a bad thing from happening.\n\nI have a Facebook, but I don't have a Myspace. But I know that there are bad people who can see things about me on the internet. I saw a TV show about this. A man was trying to show how easy it is to get information about people on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and was talking to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that, but I have had people in my classes who IM me and they know it's me. They know my name, what I look like, and where I am during the day. It's hard to know who can see your information.\n\nI tried to limit what I put on Facebook, but I also want to be able to communicate with my friends. I don't want to limit it too much. It's a tricky issue. I only accept people I know on Facebook, but I don't know who can see my information.\n\nI heard that some schools banned Myspace. I don't know if that is a good idea. I wasn't sure how schools had the right to tell students what they can and can't do on the internet. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nIs that all you have to say on this topic?",
            "I feel bad talking about the Iraq War now. I was against it from the start. But I guess it's not important anymore. Mostly everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the administration. They do not want to say they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. The United States, Iraq and the world were asked if the war was a good idea. About 75 to 80% of people said no. Even 80% of Iraqis said no. 70% of U.S. troops think the war was a bad idea and we should leave soon.\n\nI do not know what to say. The war was already a problem before we went in. And now, leaving will also be a problem. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. We have different cultures and ways of life.\n\nThis administration and past administrations think they can bring democracy to places where it is not wanted. This is not how people in that area choose to live their lives. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the good and bad before we invaded. The war made a big mess.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration has ideas about why we should stay. But I do not agree with them. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I would be okay with that. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nMany Iraqis think we should leave within a year. Some even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are saying no. If we ask them what to do, and they say leave, then it is not our fault if things go wrong.\n\nIf we leave, we can try to help again. We will not be the heroes in the Middle East, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It is not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nFor example, women often have a harder time getting jobs because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though there is supposed to be equality, many people have a hard time working with a woman in charge. This is because society has been this way for a long time.\n\nIn the workplace, women may see a job they can do and meet the requirements, but the board may not choose to promote them because it has not been common for women to be in high positions. Some industries, like fashion, can also be difficult for men. It is not common for men to stay home with children, and people often look down on them for it.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are straight. This is because men in fashion often have different styles of life. If a man in fashion has a typical style of life, people may question if he really knows about fashion.\n\nIt can be hard to change this because society has a set idea. However, people are slowly starting to accept women in business and men staying home with children. As women become more accepted in business, and men staying home become more accepted, it may become easier for people to see that both men and women can be good at different things.\n\nIt's also true that people from different areas or with different grammar skills can be discriminated against. For example, if someone from a farm with poor grammar becomes a CEO, other men may doubt his abilities because of his grammar.",
            "I think that they didn't make marijuana legal \nThey made it less serious \nFrom a crime to a traffic ticket \nYou know, something you get a fine for but not jail time \nIf you get caught with it, you might still have problems, like getting a job \nBut it's not as bad as having a real crime \nSome people think it's better to make it less serious because it's expensive to put people in jail \nTo book them, to feed them, to give them a lawyer \nIt costs a lot of money \nAnd some cities are very against marijuana \nBut Denver is more open-minded \nThey think it's okay \nAnd it's good because they have more money now to help people \nFor education, for the elderly, for the homeless \n\nI don't think marijuana should be everywhere \nBut the financial side is a good reason to make it less serious \nOther reasons are that some people don't like it \nIf it was totally legal, people might smoke it and drive \nAnd that's not safe \nAnd it's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana \nSo it would be awkward if it was out in the open \nAlcohol is bad for your driving, too \nBut marijuana can affect people's lives in other ways \nNot just their driving skills \nAnd people react differently to substances \nSome people can control themselves, but some can't \nIt's hard to say how bad marijuana is because people are different \nBut both marijuana and alcohol have their bad effects",
            "I say yes. I believe this because many things they do are like old traditions. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be connected to tradition, but it's also important to change with the times.\n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people from other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they couldn't because my dad was not a Catholic. This is not very tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others in the Catholic Church, but it seems hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the way things are practiced goes against what is taught. This is because some things are old and outdated. But they continue to do things the old way.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would change their behavior. If someone wants to do something bad, like hurt a child, they will do it anyway. This is different from a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop people who want to hurt children from doing so.",
            "I have not made up my mind on this issue.  I don't know if one side is right or wrong.  But I do think this is a difficult topic.  It is hard to decide how to define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nSomething close to the issue of church and state makes it hard to decide.  We think marriage should be a special kind of partnership between two people.  It's like being baptized.  When people get baptized, they get special benefits.  We think married people should get special benefits too.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, they should be treated the same as if they were married.  It doesn't matter if they are gay or not.  They are two people who love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on what marriage means, then the government should make it a federal law.  But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea.  It's a big decision and not worth changing the constitution for.\n\nI don't think banning gay marriage is important enough to change the constitution.  We should not change something so important just because some people disagree with it.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this issue.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not fully agree with their lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nMany states are Democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush should not be able to say the whole country is against gay marriage. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some issues should be left to each individual state. The president does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It is not fair. He will be out of office soon. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It will go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage.",
            "The writer does not agree with the school officials' actions. They say that Myspace is a public place where people can share things with others. If someone posts something on Myspace, they should expect that others, including school officials, may see it.\n\nSchool officials can see what students are doing on the internet, even if they use their own computers at home. In this case, the school officials went on the internet to prevent a school shooting. The writer believes that this was a good thing, as it may have saved lives.\n\nThe writer thinks that school officials have the right to go on the internet to check on students. If they go on the internet to catch students doing bad things, it is an invasion of privacy. But if they go on the internet to make the school a safer place, it is okay.\n\nThe writer likes to write more when they write. They say that it is easier to express themselves when they can write more. They also say that it is better to write than to talk.\n\nThe writer thinks it is silly to post something on Myspace and not expect to get in trouble. They say that everything can be seen by others, and it can come back to hurt them. They also say that once something is on the internet, it is always there.\n\nThe writer believes that school officials should not go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason, such as to make the school a safer place, it is okay. They also think that the police should be able to go on the internet to help the school officials.\n\nThe writer remembers when they went to high school. They had to do lock downs and drills to be safe. This was because of the possibility of a school shooting. The writer thinks that the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe writer is finished talking.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. At first, I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by the events of 9/11. I thought going to war would bring justice to those responsible. But now, I think we went there without a clear plan. We were not prepared for what we would face, and it backfired.\n\nI think the people in Iraq are fighting each other. They cannot unite against us if they cannot even get along with themselves. I do not think our presence in Iraq is helping their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the events of 9/11 made me feel less concerned about what is happening in Iraq. I do not think they are like us and cannot be helped by us. They have a different way of thinking about war. I believe they are not looking to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge and not to help them. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and many people wanted to go to war because of what happened on 9/11. But I do not think we had a clear plan for what we would do after going to Iraq.\n\nI think a better plan would have been to understand the situation in Iraq before we went there. We should have considered how their way of life would change and how they would react to our presence. We should have also considered what would happen after we left.\n\nIn the end, I do not think we are making enough progress in Iraq. We have made some progress, but it is not enough to justify staying there. I think the country will collapse once we leave, and we will be hurting ourselves by staying there."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not very accepting of some things.

If the Church changes its views, it will not lose its followers.\n\nSome people are against the Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not allow women to be priests and priests cannot be married. Many people think this is unfair. They believe everyone should have their own family and life outside of their job.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but they do not need a family. However, this is not true for everyone else. Most people have jobs and families. They must balance work and family life. Priests should be able to do the same. \n\nThe Church needs to be more open-minded and accept different views. This will help it keep its followers. The Church should not be against things that many people support, like gay marriage and birth control.\n\nIf the Church allows priests to be married and have families, it might not have had some problems. However, it is hard to know for sure. The Church's rules are very old and do not fit with modern society.\n\nIn the end, the Church should be more accepting of different views and allow priests to be married and have families.

            "I think gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But they are different. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but they are the same thing.\n\nGay couples have many of the same rights as others. They should be able to own property and get medical help when they are sick. But now, they can't be with their partner in the hospital.\n\nThis is not fair. A lot of scientific studies have been done on gay couples and they are just like other couples. They have the same things that make a relationship successful.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to let gay couples get married. They think it's against their religion. But the government should not be involved in church business. If a gay couple wants a marriage certificate, that's all they are asking for.\n\nJust like the civil rights movement, this is about being separate but equal. Gay couples are the same as others in many ways.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how it will affect the community. But this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They can be parents just like anyone else.\n\nChildren of gay couples are just like other children. They are influenced by their parents, but their parents' sexual orientation does not affect their parenting skills.\n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not right.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage. He thinks it's against his religion. But his views are not the only ones that matter. Morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to enforce one group's morality on the whole country. The government should be fair and equal for everyone.\n\nSome people believe that gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just what our friends and neighbors think. If we do, we will see the world in a different way.",

            "The Catholic church has changed to fit the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it was before. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. After I moved to a private school, I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend church together.\n\nNow, as I've grown older, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter service, thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some families come to church in beach clothes. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is in the church I attend. I don't know much about the church's politics, but this is my experience.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic church of not doing enough to stop priests who commit pedophilia. People think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to get married, these problems might have been avoided.\n\nI don't think this would have made a difference. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's the person, not the rules that cause the problem. When someone decides to become a priest, it's their choice. There are other religions that allow priests to get married, so if they want to get married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with it, not made that way through upbringing. You can't change it by getting married. It may come out eventually. I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.\n\nI don't have other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThis made me very upset. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

One of the Treasury Secretaries said in his book that President Bush was angry at Saddam Hussein because of his father. He wanted to expand our oil supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. But if we leave now, many more people may die. The country may fall into civil war.\n\nThe United States and the United Nations are trying a new plan.

Before we invaded Iraq, they said the war was about the September 11th terrorist attacks. But in reality, the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people after the attack to make the war seem necessary.\n\nI am against war and this one was no exception. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War in some ways. Both were long and difficult. The US government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war in Iraq. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government and tried to put in a new one. But this was a hard and long process.\n\nI do not think the US government was prepared for the problems it would face in Iraq. They should have learned from past mistakes.

They made it seem like it would be an easy thing to do.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do now. We have been in Iraq for a long time and it is hard to leave. We took away their government and their way of life. But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are still dying. The US government should have thought more about the consequences of going to war.\n\nI think the main reason for invading Iraq was to control their oil. This is one reason why we are not helping other countries become democratic.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq. But this does not seem likely.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal choice and not something that should be limited by laws. Many studies show that being gay is not a choice, but a biological fact. It is not something a person can control.\n\nI do not think politics and government should interfere with this issue. It is a personal and private matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they cannot be. However, they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. Marriage is a personal relationship between two people, not something that the government should define.\n\nStudies have shown that being gay is often a result of a chemical difference in the brain. It is something a person is born with and not something they choose. This is different from growing up in a certain way or being raised in a certain environment.\n\nIf two people, a man and a woman, want to get married, they can do so privately without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something that is made public.\n\nI am not for or against anything else about gay marriage.

They cannot ignore it. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. They may say things they do not mean. We had a situation at school like this. It was an experiment for a class. But it could be serious. Recently, something happened because someone overheard a student saying something in school.

I wasn't sure how schools had the right to tell students what they can and can't do on the internet. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nIs that all you have to say on this topic?",
            "I feel bad talking about the Iraq War now. I was against it from the start. But I guess it's not important anymore. Mostly everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the administration. They do not want to say they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. The United States, Iraq and the world were asked if the war was a good idea. About 75 to 80% of people said no. Even 80% of Iraqis said no. 70% of U.S. troops think the war was a bad idea and we should leave soon.\n\nI do not know what to say. The war was already a problem before we went in. And now, leaving will also be a problem. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. We have different cultures and ways of life.\n\nThis administration and past administrations think they can bring democracy to places where it is not wanted. This is not how people in that area choose to live their lives. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the good and bad before we invaded. The war made a big mess.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration has ideas about why we should stay. But I do not agree with them. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I would be okay with that. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nMany Iraqis think we should leave within a year. Some even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are saying no. If we ask them what to do, and they say leave, then it is not our fault if things go wrong.\n\nIf we leave, we can try to help again. We will not be the heroes in the Middle East, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It is not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nFor example, women often have a harder time getting jobs because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though there is supposed to be equality, many people have a hard time working with a woman in charge. This is because society has been this way for a long time.\n\nIn the workplace, women may see a job they can do and meet the requirements, but the board may not choose to promote them because it has not been common for women to be in high positions. Some industries, like fashion, can also be difficult for men. It is not common for men to stay home with children, and people often look down on them for it.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are straight. This is because men in fashion often have different styles of life. If a man in fashion has a typical style of life, people may question if he really knows about fashion.\n\nIt can be hard to change this because society has a set idea. However, people are slowly starting to accept women in business and men staying home with children. As women become more accepted in business, and men staying home become more accepted, it may become easier for people to see that both men and women can be good at different things.\n\nIt's also true that people from different areas or with different grammar skills can be discriminated against. For example, if someone from a farm with poor grammar becomes a CEO, other men may doubt his abilities because of his grammar.",
            "I think that they didn't make marijuana legal \nThey made it less serious \nFrom a crime to a traffic ticket \nYou know, something you get a fine for but not jail time \nIf you get caught with it, you might still have problems, like getting a job \nBut it's not as bad as having a real crime \nSome people think it's better to make it less serious because it's expensive to put people in jail \nTo book them, to feed them, to give them a lawyer \nIt costs a lot of money \nAnd some cities are very against marijuana \nBut Denver is more open-minded \nThey think it's okay \nAnd it's good because they have more money now to help people \nFor education, for the elderly, for the homeless \n\nI don't think marijuana should be everywhere \nBut the financial side is a good reason to make it less serious \nOther reasons are that some people don't like it \nIf it was totally legal, people might smoke it and drive \nAnd that's not safe \nAnd it's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana \nSo it would be awkward if it was out in the open \nAlcohol is bad for your driving, too \nBut marijuana can affect people's lives in other ways \nNot just their driving skills \nAnd people react differently to substances \nSome people can control themselves, but some can't \nIt's hard to say how bad marijuana is because people are different \nBut both marijuana and alcohol have their bad effects",
            "I say yes. I believe this because many things they do are like old traditions. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be connected to tradition, but it's also important to change with the times.\n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people from other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they couldn't because my dad was not a Catholic. This is not very tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others in the Catholic Church, but it seems hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the way things are practiced goes against what is taught. This is because some things are old and outdated. But they continue to do things the old way.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would change their behavior. If someone wants to do something bad, like hurt a child, they will do it anyway. This is different from a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop people who want to hurt children from doing so.",
            "I have not made up my mind on this issue.  I don't know if one side is right or wrong.  But I do think this is a difficult topic.  It is hard to decide how to define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nSomething close to the issue of church and state makes it hard to decide.  We think marriage should be a special kind of partnership between two people.  It's like being baptized.  When people get baptized, they get special benefits.  We think married people should get special benefits too.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, they should be treated the same as if they were married.  It doesn't matter if they are gay or not.  They are two people who love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on what marriage means, then the government should make it a federal law.  But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea.  It's a big decision and not worth changing the constitution for.\n\nI don't think banning gay marriage is important enough to change the constitution.  We should not change something so important just because some people disagree with it.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this issue.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not fully agree with their lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nMany states are Democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush should not be able to say the whole country is against gay marriage. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some issues should be left to each individual state. The president does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It is not fair. He will be out of office soon. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It will go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage.",
            "The writer does not agree with the school officials' actions. They say that Myspace is a public place where people can share things with others. If someone posts something on Myspace, they should expect that others, including school officials, may see it.\n\nSchool officials can see what students are doing on the internet, even if they use their own computers at home. In this case, the school officials went on the internet to prevent a school shooting. The writer believes that this was a good thing, as it may have saved lives.\n\nThe writer thinks that school officials have the right to go on the internet to check on students. If they go on the internet to catch students doing bad things, it is an invasion of privacy. But if they go on the internet to make the school a safer place, it is okay.\n\nThe writer likes to write more when they write. They say that it is easier to express themselves when they can write more. They also say that it is better to write than to talk.\n\nThe writer thinks it is silly to post something on Myspace and not expect to get in trouble. They say that everything can be seen by others, and it can come back to hurt them. They also say that once something is on the internet, it is always there.\n\nThe writer believes that school officials should not go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason, such as to make the school a safer place, it is okay. They also think that the police should be able to go on the internet to help the school officials.\n\nThe writer remembers when they went to high school. They had to do lock downs and drills to be safe. This was because of the possibility of a school shooting. The writer thinks that the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe writer is finished talking.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. At first, I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by the events of 9/11. I thought going to war would bring justice to those responsible. But now, I think we went there without a clear plan. We were not prepared for what we would face, and it backfired.\n\nI think the people in Iraq are fighting each other. They cannot unite against us if they cannot even get along with themselves. I do not think our presence in Iraq is helping their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the events of 9/11 made me feel less concerned about what is happening in Iraq. I do not think they are like us and cannot be helped by us. They have a different way of thinking about war. I believe they are not looking to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge and not to help them. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and many people wanted to go to war because of what happened on 9/11. But I do not think we had a clear plan for what we would do after going to Iraq.\n\nI think a better plan would have been to understand the situation in Iraq before we went there. We should have considered how their way of life would change and how they would react to our presence. We should have also considered what would happen after we left.\n\nIn the end, I do not think we are making enough progress in Iraq. We have made some progress, but it is not enough to justify staying there. I think the country will collapse once we leave, and we will be hurting ourselves by staying there."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not very accepting of some things.

If the Church changes its views, it will not lose its followers.\n\nSome people are against the Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not allow women to be priests and priests cannot be married. Many people think this is unfair. They believe everyone should have their own family and life outside of their job.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but they do not need a family. However, this is not true for everyone else. Most people have jobs and families. They must balance work and family life. Priests should be able to do the same. \n\nThe Church needs to be more open-minded and accept different views. This will help it keep its followers. The Church should not be against things that many people support, like gay marriage and birth control.\n\nIf the Church allows priests to be married and have families, it might not have had some problems. However, it is hard to know for sure. The Church's rules are very old and do not fit with modern society.\n\nIn the end, the Church should be more accepting of different views and allow priests to be married and have families.

            "I think gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason not to.\n\nSome people think gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But they are different. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads will never be tails, but they are the same thing.\n\nGay couples have many of the same rights as others. They should be able to own property and get medical help when they are sick. But now, they can't be with their partner in the hospital.\n\nThis is not fair. A lot of scientific studies have been done on gay couples and they are just like other couples. They have the same things that make a relationship successful.\n\nThe problem is that some people don't want to let gay couples get married. They think it's against their religion. But the government should not be involved in church business. If a gay couple wants a marriage certificate, that's all they are asking for.\n\nJust like the civil rights movement, this is about being separate but equal. Gay couples are the same as others in many ways.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how it will affect the community. But this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They can be parents just like anyone else.\n\nChildren of gay couples are just like other children. They are influenced by their parents, but their parents' sexual orientation does not affect their parenting skills.\n\nI think the government should be involved in making gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not right.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage. He thinks it's against his religion. But his views are not the only ones that matter. Morality is different for everyone.\n\nIt's not right for the government to enforce one group's morality on the whole country. The government should be fair and equal for everyone.\n\nSome people believe that gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts and not just what our friends and neighbors think. If we do, we will see the world in a different way.",

            "The Catholic church has changed to fit the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it was before. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes. After I moved to a private school, I saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend church together.\n\nNow, as I've grown older, the church has made some changes. They now have a shorter service, thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some families come to church in beach clothes. Even in the morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThe biggest change I've noticed is in the church I attend. I don't know much about the church's politics, but this is my experience.\n\nSome people have accused the Catholic church of not doing enough to stop priests who commit pedophilia. People think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to get married, these problems might have been avoided.\n\nI don't think this would have made a difference. There are married men who become pedophiles. It's the person, not the rules that cause the problem. When someone decides to become a priest, it's their choice. There are other religions that allow priests to get married, so if they want to get married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with it, not made that way through upbringing. You can't change it by getting married. It may come out eventually. I don't think the church could have stopped this from happening. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.\n\nI don't have other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThis made me very upset. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people.

One of the Treasury Secretaries said in his book that President Bush was angry at Saddam Hussein because of his father. He wanted to expand our oil supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. But if we leave now, many more people may die. The country may fall into civil war.\n\nThe United States and the United Nations are trying a new plan.

Before we invaded Iraq, they said the war was about the September 11th terrorist attacks. But in reality, the two were not closely connected. The government used the emotions of the American people after the attack to make the war seem necessary.\n\nI am against war and this one was no exception. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War in some ways. Both were long and difficult. The US government did not prepare for the aftermath of the war in Iraq. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government and tried to put in a new one. But this was a hard and long process.\n\nI do not think the US government was prepared for the problems it would face in Iraq. They should have learned from past mistakes.

They made it seem like it would be an easy thing to do.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do now. We have been in Iraq for a long time and it is hard to leave. We took away their government and their way of life. But we also have to think about the American soldiers who are still dying. The US government should have thought more about the consequences of going to war.\n\nI think the main reason for invading Iraq was to control their oil. This is one reason why we are not helping other countries become democratic.\n\nI hope the war will end soon and there will be peace in Iraq. But this does not seem likely.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal choice and not something that should be limited by laws. Many studies show that being gay is not a choice, but a biological fact. It is not something a person can control.\n\nI do not think politics and government should interfere with this issue. It is a personal and private matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are two or three openly gay couples who are not married because they cannot be. However, they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. Marriage is a personal relationship between two people, not something that the government should define.\n\nStudies have shown that being gay is often a result of a chemical difference in the brain. It is something a person is born with and not something they choose. This is different from growing up in a certain way or being raised in a certain environment.\n\nIf two people, a man and a woman, want to get married, they can do so privately without telling anyone. But if two gay people want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something that is made public.\n\nI am not for or against anything else about gay marriage.

They cannot ignore it. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it's hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. They may say things they do not mean. We had a situation at school like this. It was an experiment for a class. But it could be serious. Recently, something happened because someone overheard a student saying something in school.

I wasn't sure how schools had the right to tell students what they can and can't do on the internet. That doesn't seem like a good idea.\n\nIs that all you have to say on this topic?",
            "I feel bad talking about the Iraq War now. I was against it from the start. But I guess it's not important anymore. Mostly everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the administration. They do not want to say they made a mistake.\n\nWe can see this in the polls. The United States, Iraq and the world were asked if the war was a good idea. About 75 to 80% of people said no. Even 80% of Iraqis said no. 70% of U.S. troops think the war was a bad idea and we should leave soon.\n\nI do not know what to say. The war was already a problem before we went in. And now, leaving will also be a problem. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. We have different cultures and ways of life.\n\nThis administration and past administrations think they can bring democracy to places where it is not wanted. This is not how people in that area choose to live their lives. Saddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the good and bad before we invaded. The war made a big mess.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration has ideas about why we should stay. But I do not agree with them. If they want to leave slowly over a year, I would be okay with that. But I do not see a reason to stay.\n\nMany Iraqis think we should leave within a year. Some even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are saying no. If we ask them what to do, and they say leave, then it is not our fault if things go wrong.\n\nIf we leave, we can try to help again. We will not be the heroes in the Middle East, but it will be better than now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender discrimination in the United States. It is not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the kind of work you do.\n\nFor example, women often have a harder time getting jobs because of the \"glass ceiling.\" Even though there is supposed to be equality, many people have a hard time working with a woman in charge. This is because society has been this way for a long time.\n\nIn the workplace, women may see a job they can do and meet the requirements, but the board may not choose to promote them because it has not been common for women to be in high positions. Some industries, like fashion, can also be difficult for men. It is not common for men to stay home with children, and people often look down on them for it.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are straight. This is because men in fashion often have different styles of life. If a man in fashion has a typical style of life, people may question if he really knows about fashion.\n\nIt can be hard to change this because society has a set idea. However, people are slowly starting to accept women in business and men staying home with children. As women become more accepted in business, and men staying home become more accepted, it may become easier for people to see that both men and women can be good at different things.\n\nIt's also true that people from different areas or with different grammar skills can be discriminated against. For example, if someone from a farm with poor grammar becomes a CEO, other men may doubt his abilities because of his grammar.",
            "I think that they didn't make marijuana legal \nThey made it less serious \nFrom a crime to a traffic ticket \nYou know, something you get a fine for but not jail time \nIf you get caught with it, you might still have problems, like getting a job \nBut it's not as bad as having a real crime \nSome people think it's better to make it less serious because it's expensive to put people in jail \nTo book them, to feed them, to give them a lawyer \nIt costs a lot of money \nAnd some cities are very against marijuana \nBut Denver is more open-minded \nThey think it's okay \nAnd it's good because they have more money now to help people \nFor education, for the elderly, for the homeless \n\nI don't think marijuana should be everywhere \nBut the financial side is a good reason to make it less serious \nOther reasons are that some people don't like it \nIf it was totally legal, people might smoke it and drive \nAnd that's not safe \nAnd it's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana \nSo it would be awkward if it was out in the open \nAlcohol is bad for your driving, too \nBut marijuana can affect people's lives in other ways \nNot just their driving skills \nAnd people react differently to substances \nSome people can control themselves, but some can't \nIt's hard to say how bad marijuana is because people are different \nBut both marijuana and alcohol have their bad effects",
            "I say yes. I believe this because many things they do are like old traditions. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be connected to tradition, but it's also important to change with the times.\n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who don't follow the rules perfectly. They don't accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also don't accept people from other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents wanted to get married in the Catholic Church, but they couldn't because my dad was not a Catholic. This is not very tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others in the Catholic Church, but it seems hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think a lot of Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the way things are practiced goes against what is taught. This is because some things are old and outdated. But they continue to do things the old way.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would change their behavior. If someone wants to do something bad, like hurt a child, they will do it anyway. This is different from a marriage.\n\nIn conclusion, I don't think allowing priests to marry would stop people who want to hurt children from doing so.",
            "I have not made up my mind on this issue.  I don't know if one side is right or wrong.  But I do think this is a difficult topic.  It is hard to decide how to define marriage without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nSomething close to the issue of church and state makes it hard to decide.  We think marriage should be a special kind of partnership between two people.  It's like being baptized.  When people get baptized, they get special benefits.  We think married people should get special benefits too.\n\nIf two people are in a civil union, they should be treated the same as if they were married.  It doesn't matter if they are gay or not.  They are two people who love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on what marriage means, then the government should make it a federal law.  But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea.  It's a big decision and not worth changing the constitution for.\n\nI don't think banning gay marriage is important enough to change the constitution.  We should not change something so important just because some people disagree with it.\n\nI don't have an opinion on this issue.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not fully agree with their lifestyle. But I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nMany states are Democratic, and many are Republican. Democratic states support gay marriage. If you live in a Democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide about gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think the president should decide for the whole country. President Bush should not be able to say the whole country is against gay marriage. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some issues should be left to each individual state. The president does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. It is not fair. He will be out of office soon. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It will go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not agree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage.",
            "The writer does not agree with the school officials' actions. They say that Myspace is a public place where people can share things with others. If someone posts something on Myspace, they should expect that others, including school officials, may see it.\n\nSchool officials can see what students are doing on the internet, even if they use their own computers at home. In this case, the school officials went on the internet to prevent a school shooting. The writer believes that this was a good thing, as it may have saved lives.\n\nThe writer thinks that school officials have the right to go on the internet to check on students. If they go on the internet to catch students doing bad things, it is an invasion of privacy. But if they go on the internet to make the school a safer place, it is okay.\n\nThe writer likes to write more when they write. They say that it is easier to express themselves when they can write more. They also say that it is better to write than to talk.\n\nThe writer thinks it is silly to post something on Myspace and not expect to get in trouble. They say that everything can be seen by others, and it can come back to hurt them. They also say that once something is on the internet, it is always there.\n\nThe writer believes that school officials should not go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason, such as to make the school a safer place, it is okay. They also think that the police should be able to go on the internet to help the school officials.\n\nThe writer remembers when they went to high school. They had to do lock downs and drills to be safe. This was because of the possibility of a school shooting. The writer thinks that the school officials were just trying to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe writer is finished talking.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. At first, I was in favor of it because I was personally affected by the events of 9/11. I thought going to war would bring justice to those responsible. But now, I think we went there without a clear plan. We were not prepared for what we would face, and it backfired.\n\nI think the people in Iraq are fighting each other. They cannot unite against us if they cannot even get along with themselves. I do not think our presence in Iraq is helping their situation.\n\nUnfortunately, the events of 9/11 made me feel less concerned about what is happening in Iraq. I do not think they are like us and cannot be helped by us. They have a different way of thinking about war. I believe they are not looking to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war for revenge and not to help them. President Bush declared war on Iraq, and many people wanted to go to war because of what happened on 9/11. But I do not think we had a clear plan for what we would do after going to Iraq.\n\nI think a better plan would have been to understand the situation in Iraq before we went there. We should have considered how their way of life would change and how they would react to our presence. We should have also considered what would happen after we left.\n\nIn the end, I do not think we are making enough progress in Iraq. We have made some progress, but it is not enough to justify staying there. I think the country will collapse once we leave, and we will be hurting ourselves by staying there."

where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are old-fashioned and many people do not agree with them. \n\nIf the Church changed its views, it would not lose its following. Many people are against the Church because it does not agree with them on certain subjects. The Church teaches that abortion is wrong, so people who support abortion will not be comfortable following the Church. The same is true for gay marriage.\n\nThe Church is also against women priests and married priests. But this may not have changed the problems the Church is facing. We do not know if married priests or female priests would have made a difference.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but this does not mean they cannot have families. Many people have jobs and families. There is no reason why priests cannot have both.",
            "I don't have strong feelings against gay marriage. In my opinion, people are born a certain way, and they should not be blamed for who they are. It's not something they choose. I think it's unfair to say people can get married if they are a man and a woman, but not if they are two people of the same sex.\n\nIt seems that being gay is not a choice. People are born to be straight or gay. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they can change.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of law or morality. I don't think the government should tell people who they can or cannot marry.\n\nI don't think people who are gay should be blamed for who they are. They should be free to live their lives as they want.\n\nI don't think the federal government has the right to get involved in people's personal lives. It's not their place.\n\nIt's a difficult issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Some people think gay couples threaten the heterosexual family. But this is different. There are many different aspects to it, making it hard to compare.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads is not the same as tails. But it's like the same thing. Gay couples have the same civil rights as others. For example, they should have the same property taxes and health care.\n\nIf you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital unless they're considered family. This is unfair. If you're going to spend your life with someone, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship.\n\nThe issue is, gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government. If the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. Gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But children of gay couples are no different from those of straight couples. They need love and support, not fear and judgment.\n\nIn New York City, there are schools for children of gay parents because they face problems in public schools. They get bullied and parents protest to get them removed. This is unfair.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like straight couples. Parenting skills are not different.\n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against it is unfair. President Bush's views on gay marriage are based on his religion, but morality differs from person to person.\n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is hypocritical, especially when some people are against \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true, according to the American Psychological Association. People should listen to research, not popular opinion.",
            "I worked in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. \n\nI think a drug is not bad just because it is against the law. Some illegal drugs are used in hospitals because they are helpful. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances. We use them often because they are good for patients. We should not deny the benefits of marijuana just because many people do not think it is good. \n\nMany people think marijuana is bad. But it is not as bad as alcohol. If you use too much of either, you can have problems. \n\nI think we should make marijuana legal slowly, not all at once. If we do it too fast, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is bad, people might use it wisely. \n\nSome people have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. \n\nI do not think marijuana should be legal, but it should be used for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it used to be. I remember going to church every Sunday when I was young. I would get nice dresses and matching shoes. My friends and I would meet there on the weekends. Now, as I have grown older, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter service, just 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and jeans.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I have seen. The church I know does not discuss its politics, but I can see how it has changed. It is more casual now. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. Some men are married and still become pedophiles. Their behavior is not because of their marriage status. It is their choice to become priests. Some other religions allow priests to get married, so if they want to practice their faith and be married, they should choose a different church.\n\nI think being a pedophile is genetic. People are born with it, not because of how they are raised. You cannot hide it, and it usually comes out. The church cannot prevent it, but it should not try to cover it up if it knows about it.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea of invading Iraq at first. But I think people were still very upset about the September 11th attacks and we went to war for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Bush administration said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks. But all of this has been proven false.\n\nI am very angry about this. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now says he was not convinced by the evidence. I think this is wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration has no respect for the constitution and has tried to ignore it. They wanted to go to war before September 11th.\n\nA former Secretary of the Treasury said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's failed attempt. The younger Bush wanted to expand America's energy supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. But if we leave now, there will be problems. The country may fall into civil war and more people will die.\n\nThe US and the UN are trying to work together to bring order to Iraq. They want to bring in countries from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It may cause more problems in the long term.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have control and there are many groups fighting for power. The country is experiencing a lot of trouble.\n\nI am not sure what the solution is. But I know that going to war was a bad idea.",

It is making many people unhappy. If we leave, Iraq will be angry with us. If we stay, it will take a long time to create a democracy. And if we leave, Iraq will be mad at us because we caused problems. \n\nI do not know much about this topic. It is hard for me to talk about it.

A war must be declared by Congress, and this one was not.\n\nI think we should stay in Iraq to help the people. But it is also using our resources. It is making President Bush look bad. I do not want him to be known as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history.\n\nThe Vietnam War was also not declared. It was called a meaningless war. I do not want President Bush to be called the same thing.\n\nI have friends and family members in Iraq. I want the war to end because it is causing problems for them. However, I also do not want the war to end because it is making their lives better. It is hard to decide what to do.\n\nI think the war in Iraq is a complicated issue. It is hard to know what to do.

            "I do not think it is right to make marijuana legal. The state should not decide this. It is up to the churches. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This is clear.\n\nMaking laws about marijuana would be against what the Constitution says.

But the Constitution says churches can have different ideas.\n\nMany churches in the United States are against marijuana. But some, like those in Boston, are for it. I do not think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a very important part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom.

I do not think that is right.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. I do not see why the president is pushing for this law.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But one did not have much to do with the other.\n\nThe government made it seem like that. They used the emotions of the American people in their anger about the terrorist attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003. I personally am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. It's a big tragedy. They were removing the country's government, but the American government was not prepared for the problems that would happen after that. They were trying to put a democratic government in place, but it's not easy. It's like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to remove the Communists and put in a democracy.\n\nThe US government should have known it would be a long and hard process. It was not a clear victory like they thought it would be. They were fighting against the people of Iraq, not an army. They were fighting against the citizens of the country. I think the government was not prepared for all the problems that would happen.\n\nIf you go to war, you need to plan for all the possible outcomes. I think the government was not prepared for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government. We are still in Iraq today, and many American troops are still dying. They are still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to control their own country. It's a long process.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful war. They made it seem like it would be easy to put in a democratic government. But it's not easy. Democracy is a long struggle. We should have learned from our own country's history.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. It's hard to decide what to do now that we've been there for so long. We took away their government and their way of life. How can we leave them now? But there's also the problem of the many American casualties. It's too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same thing in other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It's about the oil and controlling resources. Before going to war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We are not attacking countries like North Korea that we know have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But it's not likely.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. It has been proven that it could be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. This means that people should not be punished because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is unfair and inhumane to deny people rights because of their sexual orientation. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. It is a personal matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like everyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. He is trying to be God.\n\nI have read that some people are born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay. It is not something they choose. It is not because of how they were raised. For example, someone who has many sisters and no brothers may be gay. This is a biological reason, not a social one.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big public issue.

            "When you put something on the internet, it is public and everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. I know this from my experience as a resident advisor. If you say something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. The internet is public, and many people will see what you say. If you are friends with someone on social media, you will see their messages. \n\nThe school cannot ignore things people say online. If someone hears something and reports it, the school must act. They cannot wait, or they might miss a chance to prevent a problem. \n\nBut it is hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. It could be an experiment gone wrong, like a sociology class project. Or it could be serious. \n\nIn this case, someone overheard a student saying something. They reported it, and the school found out who said it. They looked at the student's online profiles and saw things that could be serious. The student had posted things that might be jokes, but in this situation, people thought they were serious. \n\nWhen you put something online, you give up your privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. If you don't want people to think something of you, don't post it. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not look at their private messages and profiles.

If it is a danger, they must act.\n\nI don't think teachers should make fake social media accounts to friend their students. That is not right.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nI believe the original purpose was good: to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are now fighting just to show we are powerful. \nI also think the motives may have been questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we were fighting to give democracy to a country, that would be fine. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it was not right. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I don't think that's why we are fighting now. \nOur reasons have changed. \nWe're fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe country's leaders will have to take care of themselves soon. \nThat time has come. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe should use that money to help our own country. \nWe have problems with poverty and roads and schools that need fixing. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important to us. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \nWe have many problems to solve at home. \nWe should use our money to help our own people. \nRight now, our money is being used to kill our own citizens in a war that is not important to us.",

It is hard to know who is really your friend on the internet.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it is hard. The point of having Facebook is to talk to friends. But you never know who can see what you say. My roommate told me that her school once banned students from having Myspace accounts. I don't know if that is right. Schools should not have the power to tell students what they can and cannot have on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad talking about it because many people already disagree with the war. I was also against it from the beginning. But it's not that important now. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people in the world think so, including seventy percent of US troops in Iraq.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was very bad before the US went in. Now, pulling out is also a problem. There is no easy answer for this situation. It's like a big cultural difference between the US and Middle Eastern countries. Americans think they can bring democracy to Iraq, but the Iraqis might not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we had to think carefully before invading his country. The war has been a disaster. I do not see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. If the US wants to leave gradually, I wouldn't mind. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now.\n\nMost Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. They know their country better than the US. If we leave and things get bad, we can say we followed their wishes. If we stay and things get bad, we will be blamed.\n\nI do not think we can be the good guys in the Middle East. But leaving would be better than staying where we are now.",
            "I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States.  This is not just about women, but about the job field as well.  Most people find it hard to work under a woman because society has been raised for a long time that men are in charge.\n\nWomen often see a job they can do well, but may not be chosen for it because it's not seen that women are in high places in business.  The same thing happens to men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  Society looks down on men who stay home with their children, even if it's their dream. \n\nIn the fashion industry, people do not take straight men seriously.  They think if you're a man in fashion, you probably have a different lifestyle, so how can you really know about fashion for women?  Depending on the job field, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set mindset.  But we are making progress.  Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business.  More men are staying home to take care of their children, and people are starting to accept that.  We just need to promote the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being too pushy.  If we do this too fast, people will resist.  We have come a long way, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they are from or their grammar.  If someone from a farm with poor grammar but good intelligence tries to become a CEO, other men may look down on them because they don't think they can express themselves well.",
            "I think what happened in this place is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it less serious. \nThey changed it from a crime to something like a traffic ticket. \nYou can get in trouble, but it is not as bad as before. \nIf you get caught, you will get a ticket. \nThis is good because it will not affect your future as much. \nBut at the same time, there are some problems. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and keep people in jail. \nAnd it costs money to take them to court and for them to have a lawyer. \nSo, if a city is in financial trouble, they might not want to do this. \nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay. \nAnd it is true that they have more money to spend on important things. \nThey can spend it on education, help for old people, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nI think it is a good idea. \nBut there are some problems. \nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it everywhere. \nThey might drive while smoking, which is not safe. \nAnd it is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSome people do not want it to be legal. \nThey think it will be a problem.\n\nI do not know what to think. \nBut I think marijuana can be bad for some people. \nIt can affect their judgment and their lifestyle. \nBut it is not the same for everyone. \nSome people can handle it, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say for sure.",
            "I agree. Here's why. \n\nMany things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to change with times.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are not the same religion. My dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church would not marry them. This is not very tolerant of other religions.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic school. This is a Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them.\n\nSo I think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but then the practice goes against it. This is because it's outdated. But they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from molesting children. If someone is going to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's different to be with a child than with a spouse.\n\nSo I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult problem. It is hard to decide without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is about the separation of church and state. It is also about how to define marriage. This is a very hard thing to do. It involves many people and many different ideas.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what kind of marriage is good or bad. I think it should just be about two people getting together and living together. They should not have to worry about what the government thinks about their marriage.\n\nPeople who are gay should be allowed to have the same rights as other couples. They should be able to get married and have the same tax breaks and other benefits. It is not fair to treat them differently.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nWe should not change the constitution just to make one group of people unhappy. We should let people live their lives as they want. \n\nI do not support a ban on gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a confusing issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with this lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think a democratic state will be in favor of gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should decide if they want to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run. Some things should be left to each individual state. President Bush will leave office in a few years. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be changed. Each state should decide for itself because they will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have any other thoughts on this subject.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials' actions. They went on the internet to see if students were doing anything wrong. Myspace is a public place. If students post things there, they should be prepared for others to see them. The school officials could see the information even if it was not under the school's name.\n\nThey can still find it at home. And if it helps prevent a school shooting, I think that is a good reason to look. Students are a school's responsibility. If school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing something wrong, they are doing their job. I do not think this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut I do think it is an invasion of privacy if they go on the internet just to catch students doing something wrong. They are trying to catch students in trouble. I do not think this is right. If they are looking for a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself when you write. I do not think it is right for students to post things on the internet that they do not want others to see. If you post something on the internet, it will always be there. If you do something wrong, you will get in trouble.\n\nI do not think that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion of privacy. Other officials, like the police, can also go on the internet if they have a good reason.\n\nWhen parents drop off their children at school, they think the school is a safe place. The school officials were trying to make the school safer. They were practicing things like lock downs in case of a school shooting. This is like the Columbine incident. I think the school officials were doing their job.",
            "I was for the war, but now I am against it. \nI was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI wanted to fight back and hurt those who caused it. \nBut, I think we went to war without a good plan. \nWe did not think about what could happen later. \nWe just acted on our feelings, not on a plan. \nNow, I think the war did not help. \nThe people over there are fighting each other. \nThey cannot fight against us if they fight each other. \nI do not care about what happens to them anymore. \nSometimes, I think they are not human. \nThey are very different from us. They fight all the time and do not try to make their country better. \nThey just want us to leave. \nI think we should leave them alone. \nWe went to war without knowing what to expect. \nWar is different for them than it is for us. \nThey are very aggressive and do not care about their country. \nI think we should have thought more before going to war. \nWe were not thinking clearly. \nWe wanted revenge. \nPresident Bush wanted to go to war because many people wanted it. \nHe declared war on Iraq without a good plan. \nI think we had to go to war, but we could have done it better. \nWe did not have a clear plan to create order. \nWe were not united. \nWe did not know why we were fighting. \nI think a clear plan would have helped us. \nWe went to war with anger and emotion. \nThat caused problems in Iraq. \nI do not think we can change the people in Iraq. \nThey will always be the same. \nI do not think we should stay in Iraq. \nWe have made some progress, but not enough. \nIraq will collapse when we leave. \nStaying in Iraq is hurting us. \nWe should leave and let them handle their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are old-fashioned and many people do not agree with them. \n\nIf the Church changed its views, it would not lose its following. Many people are against the Church because it does not agree with them on certain subjects. The Church teaches that abortion is wrong, so people who support abortion will not be comfortable following the Church. The same is true for gay marriage.\n\nThe Church is also against women priests and married priests. But this may not have changed the problems the Church is facing. We do not know if married priests or female priests would have made a difference.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but this does not mean they cannot have families. Many people have jobs and families. There is no reason why priests cannot have both.",
            "I don't have strong feelings against gay marriage. In my opinion, people are born a certain way, and they should not be blamed for who they are. It's not something they choose. I think it's unfair to say people can get married if they are a man and a woman, but not if they are two people of the same sex.\n\nIt seems that being gay is not a choice. People are born to be straight or gay. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they can change.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of law or morality. I don't think the government should tell people who they can or cannot marry.\n\nI don't think people who are gay should be blamed for who they are. They should be free to live their lives as they want.\n\nI don't think the federal government has the right to get involved in people's personal lives. It's not their place.\n\nIt's a difficult issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Some people think gay couples threaten the heterosexual family. But this is different. There are many different aspects to it, making it hard to compare.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads is not the same as tails. But it's like the same thing. Gay couples have the same civil rights as others. For example, they should have the same property taxes and health care.\n\nIf you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital unless they're considered family. This is unfair. If you're going to spend your life with someone, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship.\n\nThe issue is, gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government. If the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. Gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But children of gay couples are no different from those of straight couples. They need love and support, not fear and judgment.\n\nIn New York City, there are schools for children of gay parents because they face problems in public schools. They get bullied and parents protest to get them removed. This is unfair.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like straight couples. Parenting skills are not different.\n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against it is unfair. President Bush's views on gay marriage are based on his religion, but morality differs from person to person.\n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is hypocritical, especially when some people are against \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true, according to the American Psychological Association. People should listen to research, not popular opinion.",
            "I worked in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. \n\nI think a drug is not bad just because it is against the law. Some illegal drugs are used in hospitals because they are helpful. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances. We use them often because they are good for patients. We should not deny the benefits of marijuana just because many people do not think it is good. \n\nMany people think marijuana is bad. But it is not as bad as alcohol. If you use too much of either, you can have problems. \n\nI think we should make marijuana legal slowly, not all at once. If we do it too fast, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is bad, people might use it wisely. \n\nSome people have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. \n\nI do not think marijuana should be legal, but it should be used for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it used to be. I remember going to church every Sunday when I was young. I would get nice dresses and matching shoes. My friends and I would meet there on the weekends. Now, as I have grown older, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter service, just 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and jeans.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I have seen. The church I know does not discuss its politics, but I can see how it has changed. It is more casual now. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. Some men are married and still become pedophiles. Their behavior is not because of their marriage status. It is their choice to become priests. Some other religions allow priests to get married, so if they want to practice their faith and be married, they should choose a different church.\n\nI think being a pedophile is genetic. People are born with it, not because of how they are raised. You cannot hide it, and it usually comes out. The church cannot prevent it, but it should not try to cover it up if it knows about it.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea of invading Iraq at first. But I think people were still very upset about the September 11th attacks and we went to war for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Bush administration said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks. But all of this has been proven false.\n\nI am very angry about this. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now says he was not convinced by the evidence. I think this is wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration has no respect for the constitution and has tried to ignore it. They wanted to go to war before September 11th.\n\nA former Secretary of the Treasury said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's failed attempt. The younger Bush wanted to expand America's energy supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. But if we leave now, there will be problems. The country may fall into civil war and more people will die.\n\nThe US and the UN are trying to work together to bring order to Iraq. They want to bring in countries from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It may cause more problems in the long term.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have control and there are many groups fighting for power. The country is experiencing a lot of trouble.\n\nI am not sure what the solution is. But I know that going to war was a bad idea.",

It is making many people unhappy. If we leave, Iraq will be angry with us. If we stay, it will take a long time to create a democracy. And if we leave, Iraq will be mad at us because we caused problems. \n\nI do not know much about this topic. It is hard for me to talk about it.

A war must be declared by Congress, and this one was not.\n\nI think we should stay in Iraq to help the people. But it is also using our resources. It is making President Bush look bad. I do not want him to be known as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history.\n\nThe Vietnam War was also not declared. It was called a meaningless war. I do not want President Bush to be called the same thing.\n\nI have friends and family members in Iraq. I want the war to end because it is causing problems for them. However, I also do not want the war to end because it is making their lives better. It is hard to decide what to do.\n\nI think the war in Iraq is a complicated issue. It is hard to know what to do.

            "I do not think it is right to make marijuana legal. The state should not decide this. It is up to the churches. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This is clear.\n\nMaking laws about marijuana would be against what the Constitution says.

But the Constitution says churches can have different ideas.\n\nMany churches in the United States are against marijuana. But some, like those in Boston, are for it. I do not think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a very important part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom.

I do not think that is right.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. I do not see why the president is pushing for this law.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But one did not have much to do with the other.\n\nThe government made it seem like that. They used the emotions of the American people in their anger about the terrorist attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003. I personally am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. It's a big tragedy. They were removing the country's government, but the American government was not prepared for the problems that would happen after that. They were trying to put a democratic government in place, but it's not easy. It's like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to remove the Communists and put in a democracy.\n\nThe US government should have known it would be a long and hard process. It was not a clear victory like they thought it would be. They were fighting against the people of Iraq, not an army. They were fighting against the citizens of the country. I think the government was not prepared for all the problems that would happen.\n\nIf you go to war, you need to plan for all the possible outcomes. I think the government was not prepared for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government. We are still in Iraq today, and many American troops are still dying. They are still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to control their own country. It's a long process.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful war. They made it seem like it would be easy to put in a democratic government. But it's not easy. Democracy is a long struggle. We should have learned from our own country's history.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. It's hard to decide what to do now that we've been there for so long. We took away their government and their way of life. How can we leave them now? But there's also the problem of the many American casualties. It's too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same thing in other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It's about the oil and controlling resources. Before going to war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We are not attacking countries like North Korea that we know have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But it's not likely.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. It has been proven that it could be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. This means that people should not be punished because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is unfair and inhumane to deny people rights because of their sexual orientation. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. It is a personal matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like everyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. He is trying to be God.\n\nI have read that some people are born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay. It is not something they choose. It is not because of how they were raised. For example, someone who has many sisters and no brothers may be gay. This is a biological reason, not a social one.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big public issue.

            "When you put something on the internet, it is public and everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. I know this from my experience as a resident advisor. If you say something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. The internet is public, and many people will see what you say. If you are friends with someone on social media, you will see their messages. \n\nThe school cannot ignore things people say online. If someone hears something and reports it, the school must act. They cannot wait, or they might miss a chance to prevent a problem. \n\nBut it is hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. It could be an experiment gone wrong, like a sociology class project. Or it could be serious. \n\nIn this case, someone overheard a student saying something. They reported it, and the school found out who said it. They looked at the student's online profiles and saw things that could be serious. The student had posted things that might be jokes, but in this situation, people thought they were serious. \n\nWhen you put something online, you give up your privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. If you don't want people to think something of you, don't post it. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not look at their private messages and profiles.

If it is a danger, they must act.\n\nI don't think teachers should make fake social media accounts to friend their students. That is not right.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nI believe the original purpose was good: to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are now fighting just to show we are powerful. \nI also think the motives may have been questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we were fighting to give democracy to a country, that would be fine. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it was not right. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I don't think that's why we are fighting now. \nOur reasons have changed. \nWe're fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe country's leaders will have to take care of themselves soon. \nThat time has come. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe should use that money to help our own country. \nWe have problems with poverty and roads and schools that need fixing. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important to us. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \nWe have many problems to solve at home. \nWe should use our money to help our own people. \nRight now, our money is being used to kill our own citizens in a war that is not important to us.",

It is hard to know who is really your friend on the internet.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it is hard. The point of having Facebook is to talk to friends. But you never know who can see what you say. My roommate told me that her school once banned students from having Myspace accounts. I don't know if that is right. Schools should not have the power to tell students what they can and cannot have on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad talking about it because many people already disagree with the war. I was also against it from the beginning. But it's not that important now. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people in the world think so, including seventy percent of US troops in Iraq.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was very bad before the US went in. Now, pulling out is also a problem. There is no easy answer for this situation. It's like a big cultural difference between the US and Middle Eastern countries. Americans think they can bring democracy to Iraq, but the Iraqis might not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we had to think carefully before invading his country. The war has been a disaster. I do not see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. If the US wants to leave gradually, I wouldn't mind. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now.\n\nMost Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. They know their country better than the US. If we leave and things get bad, we can say we followed their wishes. If we stay and things get bad, we will be blamed.\n\nI do not think we can be the good guys in the Middle East. But leaving would be better than staying where we are now.",
            "I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States.  This is not just about women, but about the job field as well.  Most people find it hard to work under a woman because society has been raised for a long time that men are in charge.\n\nWomen often see a job they can do well, but may not be chosen for it because it's not seen that women are in high places in business.  The same thing happens to men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  Society looks down on men who stay home with their children, even if it's their dream. \n\nIn the fashion industry, people do not take straight men seriously.  They think if you're a man in fashion, you probably have a different lifestyle, so how can you really know about fashion for women?  Depending on the job field, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set mindset.  But we are making progress.  Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business.  More men are staying home to take care of their children, and people are starting to accept that.  We just need to promote the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being too pushy.  If we do this too fast, people will resist.  We have come a long way, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they are from or their grammar.  If someone from a farm with poor grammar but good intelligence tries to become a CEO, other men may look down on them because they don't think they can express themselves well.",
            "I think what happened in this place is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it less serious. \nThey changed it from a crime to something like a traffic ticket. \nYou can get in trouble, but it is not as bad as before. \nIf you get caught, you will get a ticket. \nThis is good because it will not affect your future as much. \nBut at the same time, there are some problems. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and keep people in jail. \nAnd it costs money to take them to court and for them to have a lawyer. \nSo, if a city is in financial trouble, they might not want to do this. \nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay. \nAnd it is true that they have more money to spend on important things. \nThey can spend it on education, help for old people, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nI think it is a good idea. \nBut there are some problems. \nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it everywhere. \nThey might drive while smoking, which is not safe. \nAnd it is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSome people do not want it to be legal. \nThey think it will be a problem.\n\nI do not know what to think. \nBut I think marijuana can be bad for some people. \nIt can affect their judgment and their lifestyle. \nBut it is not the same for everyone. \nSome people can handle it, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say for sure.",
            "I agree. Here's why. \n\nMany things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to change with times.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are not the same religion. My dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church would not marry them. This is not very tolerant of other religions.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic school. This is a Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them.\n\nSo I think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but then the practice goes against it. This is because it's outdated. But they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from molesting children. If someone is going to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's different to be with a child than with a spouse.\n\nSo I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult problem. It is hard to decide without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is about the separation of church and state. It is also about how to define marriage. This is a very hard thing to do. It involves many people and many different ideas.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what kind of marriage is good or bad. I think it should just be about two people getting together and living together. They should not have to worry about what the government thinks about their marriage.\n\nPeople who are gay should be allowed to have the same rights as other couples. They should be able to get married and have the same tax breaks and other benefits. It is not fair to treat them differently.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nWe should not change the constitution just to make one group of people unhappy. We should let people live their lives as they want. \n\nI do not support a ban on gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a confusing issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with this lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think a democratic state will be in favor of gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should decide if they want to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run. Some things should be left to each individual state. President Bush will leave office in a few years. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be changed. Each state should decide for itself because they will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have any other thoughts on this subject.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials' actions. They went on the internet to see if students were doing anything wrong. Myspace is a public place. If students post things there, they should be prepared for others to see them. The school officials could see the information even if it was not under the school's name.\n\nThey can still find it at home. And if it helps prevent a school shooting, I think that is a good reason to look. Students are a school's responsibility. If school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing something wrong, they are doing their job. I do not think this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut I do think it is an invasion of privacy if they go on the internet just to catch students doing something wrong. They are trying to catch students in trouble. I do not think this is right. If they are looking for a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself when you write. I do not think it is right for students to post things on the internet that they do not want others to see. If you post something on the internet, it will always be there. If you do something wrong, you will get in trouble.\n\nI do not think that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion of privacy. Other officials, like the police, can also go on the internet if they have a good reason.\n\nWhen parents drop off their children at school, they think the school is a safe place. The school officials were trying to make the school safer. They were practicing things like lock downs in case of a school shooting. This is like the Columbine incident. I think the school officials were doing their job.",
            "I was for the war, but now I am against it. \nI was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI wanted to fight back and hurt those who caused it. \nBut, I think we went to war without a good plan. \nWe did not think about what could happen later. \nWe just acted on our feelings, not on a plan. \nNow, I think the war did not help. \nThe people over there are fighting each other. \nThey cannot fight against us if they fight each other. \nI do not care about what happens to them anymore. \nSometimes, I think they are not human. \nThey are very different from us. They fight all the time and do not try to make their country better. \nThey just want us to leave. \nI think we should leave them alone. \nWe went to war without knowing what to expect. \nWar is different for them than it is for us. \nThey are very aggressive and do not care about their country. \nI think we should have thought more before going to war. \nWe were not thinking clearly. \nWe wanted revenge. \nPresident Bush wanted to go to war because many people wanted it. \nHe declared war on Iraq without a good plan. \nI think we had to go to war, but we could have done it better. \nWe did not have a clear plan to create order. \nWe were not united. \nWe did not know why we were fighting. \nI think a clear plan would have helped us. \nWe went to war with anger and emotion. \nThat caused problems in Iraq. \nI do not think we can change the people in Iraq. \nThey will always be the same. \nI do not think we should stay in Iraq. \nWe have made some progress, but not enough. \nIraq will collapse when we leave. \nStaying in Iraq is hurting us. \nWe should leave and let them handle their own problems."

studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are old-fashioned and many people do not agree with them. \n\nIf the Church changed its views, it would not lose its following. Many people are against the Church because it does not agree with them on certain subjects. The Church teaches that abortion is wrong, so people who support abortion will not be comfortable following the Church. The same is true for gay marriage.\n\nThe Church is also against women priests and married priests. But this may not have changed the problems the Church is facing. We do not know if married priests or female priests would have made a difference.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but this does not mean they cannot have families. Many people have jobs and families. There is no reason why priests cannot have both.",
            "I don't have strong feelings against gay marriage. In my opinion, people are born a certain way, and they should not be blamed for who they are. It's not something they choose. I think it's unfair to say people can get married if they are a man and a woman, but not if they are two people of the same sex.\n\nIt seems that being gay is not a choice. People are born to be straight or gay. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they can change.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of law or morality. I don't think the government should tell people who they can or cannot marry.\n\nI don't think people who are gay should be blamed for who they are. They should be free to live their lives as they want.\n\nI don't think the federal government has the right to get involved in people's personal lives. It's not their place.\n\nIt's a difficult issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Some people think gay couples threaten the heterosexual family. But this is different. There are many different aspects to it, making it hard to compare.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads is not the same as tails. But it's like the same thing. Gay couples have the same civil rights as others. For example, they should have the same property taxes and health care.\n\nIf you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital unless they're considered family. This is unfair. If you're going to spend your life with someone, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship.\n\nThe issue is, gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government. If the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. Gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But children of gay couples are no different from those of straight couples. They need love and support, not fear and judgment.\n\nIn New York City, there are schools for children of gay parents because they face problems in public schools. They get bullied and parents protest to get them removed. This is unfair.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like straight couples. Parenting skills are not different.\n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against it is unfair. President Bush's views on gay marriage are based on his religion, but morality differs from person to person.\n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is hypocritical, especially when some people are against \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true, according to the American Psychological Association. People should listen to research, not popular opinion.",
            "I worked in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. \n\nI think a drug is not bad just because it is against the law. Some illegal drugs are used in hospitals because they are helpful. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances. We use them often because they are good for patients. We should not deny the benefits of marijuana just because many people do not think it is good. \n\nMany people think marijuana is bad. But it is not as bad as alcohol. If you use too much of either, you can have problems. \n\nI think we should make marijuana legal slowly, not all at once. If we do it too fast, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is bad, people might use it wisely. \n\nSome people have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. \n\nI do not think marijuana should be legal, but it should be used for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it used to be. I remember going to church every Sunday when I was young. I would get nice dresses and matching shoes. My friends and I would meet there on the weekends. Now, as I have grown older, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter service, just 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and jeans.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I have seen. The church I know does not discuss its politics, but I can see how it has changed. It is more casual now. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. Some men are married and still become pedophiles. Their behavior is not because of their marriage status. It is their choice to become priests. Some other religions allow priests to get married, so if they want to practice their faith and be married, they should choose a different church.\n\nI think being a pedophile is genetic. People are born with it, not because of how they are raised. You cannot hide it, and it usually comes out. The church cannot prevent it, but it should not try to cover it up if it knows about it.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea of invading Iraq at first. But I think people were still very upset about the September 11th attacks and we went to war for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Bush administration said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks. But all of this has been proven false.\n\nI am very angry about this. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now says he was not convinced by the evidence. I think this is wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration has no respect for the constitution and has tried to ignore it. They wanted to go to war before September 11th.\n\nA former Secretary of the Treasury said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's failed attempt. The younger Bush wanted to expand America's energy supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. But if we leave now, there will be problems. The country may fall into civil war and more people will die.\n\nThe US and the UN are trying to work together to bring order to Iraq. They want to bring in countries from the surrounding area, like Syria and Saudi Arabia. But I am not sure this is a good idea. It may cause more problems in the long term.\n\nIraq's government is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have control and there are many groups fighting for power. The country is experiencing a lot of trouble.\n\nI am not sure what the solution is. But I know that going to war was a bad idea.",

It is making many people unhappy. If we leave, Iraq will be angry with us. If we stay, it will take a long time to create a democracy. And if we leave, Iraq will be mad at us because we caused problems. \n\nI do not know much about this topic. It is hard for me to talk about it.

A war must be declared by Congress, and this one was not.\n\nI think we should stay in Iraq to help the people. But it is also using our resources. It is making President Bush look bad. I do not want him to be known as one of the worst presidents in U.S. history.\n\nThe Vietnam War was also not declared. It was called a meaningless war. I do not want President Bush to be called the same thing.\n\nI have friends and family members in Iraq. I want the war to end because it is causing problems for them. However, I also do not want the war to end because it is making their lives better. It is hard to decide what to do.\n\nI think the war in Iraq is a complicated issue. It is hard to know what to do.

            "I do not think it is right to make marijuana legal. The state should not decide this. It is up to the churches. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This is clear.\n\nMaking laws about marijuana would be against what the Constitution says.

But the Constitution says churches can have different ideas.\n\nMany churches in the United States are against marijuana. But some, like those in Boston, are for it. I do not think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a very important part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom.

I do not think that is right.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. I do not see why the president is pushing for this law.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But one did not have much to do with the other.\n\nThe government made it seem like that. They used the emotions of the American people in their anger about the terrorist attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003. I personally am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. It's a big tragedy. They were removing the country's government, but the American government was not prepared for the problems that would happen after that. They were trying to put a democratic government in place, but it's not easy. It's like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to remove the Communists and put in a democracy.\n\nThe US government should have known it would be a long and hard process. It was not a clear victory like they thought it would be. They were fighting against the people of Iraq, not an army. They were fighting against the citizens of the country. I think the government was not prepared for all the problems that would happen.\n\nIf you go to war, you need to plan for all the possible outcomes. I think the government was not prepared for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government. We are still in Iraq today, and many American troops are still dying. They are still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to control their own country. It's a long process.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful war. They made it seem like it would be easy to put in a democratic government. But it's not easy. Democracy is a long struggle. We should have learned from our own country's history.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. It's hard to decide what to do now that we've been there for so long. We took away their government and their way of life. How can we leave them now? But there's also the problem of the many American casualties. It's too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same thing in other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It's about the oil and controlling resources. Before going to war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We are not attacking countries like North Korea that we know have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But it's not likely.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. It has been proven that it could be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. This means that people should not be punished because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is unfair and inhumane to deny people rights because of their sexual orientation. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. It is a personal matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like everyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. He is trying to be God.\n\nI have read that some people are born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay. It is not something they choose. It is not because of how they were raised. For example, someone who has many sisters and no brothers may be gay. This is a biological reason, not a social one.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big public issue.

            "When you put something on the internet, it is public and everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. I know this from my experience as a resident advisor. If you say something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. The internet is public, and many people will see what you say. If you are friends with someone on social media, you will see their messages. \n\nThe school cannot ignore things people say online. If someone hears something and reports it, the school must act. They cannot wait, or they might miss a chance to prevent a problem. \n\nBut it is hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. It could be an experiment gone wrong, like a sociology class project. Or it could be serious. \n\nIn this case, someone overheard a student saying something. They reported it, and the school found out who said it. They looked at the student's online profiles and saw things that could be serious. The student had posted things that might be jokes, but in this situation, people thought they were serious. \n\nWhen you put something online, you give up your privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. If you don't want people to think something of you, don't post it. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not look at their private messages and profiles.

If it is a danger, they must act.\n\nI don't think teachers should make fake social media accounts to friend their students. That is not right.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nI believe the original purpose was good: to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are now fighting just to show we are powerful. \nI also think the motives may have been questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we were fighting to give democracy to a country, that would be fine. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it was not right. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I don't think that's why we are fighting now. \nOur reasons have changed. \nWe're fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe country's leaders will have to take care of themselves soon. \nThat time has come. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe should use that money to help our own country. \nWe have problems with poverty and roads and schools that need fixing. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important to us. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \nWe have many problems to solve at home. \nWe should use our money to help our own people. \nRight now, our money is being used to kill our own citizens in a war that is not important to us.",

It is hard to know who is really your friend on the internet.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it is hard. The point of having Facebook is to talk to friends. But you never know who can see what you say. My roommate told me that her school once banned students from having Myspace accounts. I don't know if that is right. Schools should not have the power to tell students what they can and cannot have on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad talking about it because many people already disagree with the war. I was also against it from the beginning. But it's not that important now. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people in the world think so, including seventy percent of US troops in Iraq.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was very bad before the US went in. Now, pulling out is also a problem. There is no easy answer for this situation. It's like a big cultural difference between the US and Middle Eastern countries. Americans think they can bring democracy to Iraq, but the Iraqis might not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we had to think carefully before invading his country. The war has been a disaster. I do not see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. If the US wants to leave gradually, I wouldn't mind. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now.\n\nMost Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. They know their country better than the US. If we leave and things get bad, we can say we followed their wishes. If we stay and things get bad, we will be blamed.\n\nI do not think we can be the good guys in the Middle East. But leaving would be better than staying where we are now.",
            "I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States.  This is not just about women, but about the job field as well.  Most people find it hard to work under a woman because society has been raised for a long time that men are in charge.\n\nWomen often see a job they can do well, but may not be chosen for it because it's not seen that women are in high places in business.  The same thing happens to men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  Society looks down on men who stay home with their children, even if it's their dream. \n\nIn the fashion industry, people do not take straight men seriously.  They think if you're a man in fashion, you probably have a different lifestyle, so how can you really know about fashion for women?  Depending on the job field, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set mindset.  But we are making progress.  Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business.  More men are staying home to take care of their children, and people are starting to accept that.  We just need to promote the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being too pushy.  If we do this too fast, people will resist.  We have come a long way, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they are from or their grammar.  If someone from a farm with poor grammar but good intelligence tries to become a CEO, other men may look down on them because they don't think they can express themselves well.",
            "I think what happened in this place is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it less serious. \nThey changed it from a crime to something like a traffic ticket. \nYou can get in trouble, but it is not as bad as before. \nIf you get caught, you will get a ticket. \nThis is good because it will not affect your future as much. \nBut at the same time, there are some problems. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and keep people in jail. \nAnd it costs money to take them to court and for them to have a lawyer. \nSo, if a city is in financial trouble, they might not want to do this. \nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay. \nAnd it is true that they have more money to spend on important things. \nThey can spend it on education, help for old people, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nI think it is a good idea. \nBut there are some problems. \nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it everywhere. \nThey might drive while smoking, which is not safe. \nAnd it is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSome people do not want it to be legal. \nThey think it will be a problem.\n\nI do not know what to think. \nBut I think marijuana can be bad for some people. \nIt can affect their judgment and their lifestyle. \nBut it is not the same for everyone. \nSome people can handle it, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say for sure.",
            "I agree. Here's why. \n\nMany things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to change with times.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are not the same religion. My dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church would not marry them. This is not very tolerant of other religions.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic school. This is a Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them.\n\nSo I think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but then the practice goes against it. This is because it's outdated. But they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from molesting children. If someone is going to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's different to be with a child than with a spouse.\n\nSo I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult problem. It is hard to decide without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is about the separation of church and state. It is also about how to define marriage. This is a very hard thing to do. It involves many people and many different ideas.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what kind of marriage is good or bad. I think it should just be about two people getting together and living together. They should not have to worry about what the government thinks about their marriage.\n\nPeople who are gay should be allowed to have the same rights as other couples. They should be able to get married and have the same tax breaks and other benefits. It is not fair to treat them differently.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nWe should not change the constitution just to make one group of people unhappy. We should let people live their lives as they want. \n\nI do not support a ban on gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a confusing issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with this lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think a democratic state will be in favor of gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should decide if they want to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run. Some things should be left to each individual state. President Bush will leave office in a few years. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be changed. Each state should decide for itself because they will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have any other thoughts on this subject.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials' actions. They went on the internet to see if students were doing anything wrong. Myspace is a public place. If students post things there, they should be prepared for others to see them. The school officials could see the information even if it was not under the school's name.\n\nThey can still find it at home. And if it helps prevent a school shooting, I think that is a good reason to look. Students are a school's responsibility. If school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing something wrong, they are doing their job. I do not think this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut I do think it is an invasion of privacy if they go on the internet just to catch students doing something wrong. They are trying to catch students in trouble. I do not think this is right. If they are looking for a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself when you write. I do not think it is right for students to post things on the internet that they do not want others to see. If you post something on the internet, it will always be there. If you do something wrong, you will get in trouble.\n\nI do not think that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion of privacy. Other officials, like the police, can also go on the internet if they have a good reason.\n\nWhen parents drop off their children at school, they think the school is a safe place. The school officials were trying to make the school safer. They were practicing things like lock downs in case of a school shooting. This is like the Columbine incident. I think the school officials were doing their job.",
            "I was for the war, but now I am against it. \nI was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI wanted to fight back and hurt those who caused it. \nBut, I think we went to war without a good plan. \nWe did not think about what could happen later. \nWe just acted on our feelings, not on a plan. \nNow, I think the war did not help. \nThe people over there are fighting each other. \nThey cannot fight against us if they fight each other. \nI do not care about what happens to them anymore. \nSometimes, I think they are not human. \nThey are very different from us. They fight all the time and do not try to make their country better. \nThey just want us to leave. \nI think we should leave them alone. \nWe went to war without knowing what to expect. \nWar is different for them than it is for us. \nThey are very aggressive and do not care about their country. \nI think we should have thought more before going to war. \nWe were not thinking clearly. \nWe wanted revenge. \nPresident Bush wanted to go to war because many people wanted it. \nHe declared war on Iraq without a good plan. \nI think we had to go to war, but we could have done it better. \nWe did not have a clear plan to create order. \nWe were not united. \nWe did not know why we were fighting. \nI think a clear plan would have helped us. \nWe went to war with anger and emotion. \nThat caused problems in Iraq. \nI do not think we can change the people in Iraq. \nThey will always be the same. \nI do not think we should stay in Iraq. \nWe have made some progress, but not enough. \nIraq will collapse when we leave. \nStaying in Iraq is hurting us. \nWe should leave and let them handle their own problems."
