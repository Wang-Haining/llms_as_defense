            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not accepting of many things. The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are old-fashioned and many people do not agree with them. \n\nIf the Church changed its views, it would not lose its following. Many people are against the Church because it does not agree with them on certain subjects. The Church teaches that abortion is wrong, so people who support abortion will not be comfortable following the Church. The same is true for gay marriage.\n\nThe Church is also against women priests and married priests. But this may not have changed the problems the Church is facing. We do not know if married priests or female priests would have made a difference.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but this does not mean they cannot have families. Many people have jobs and families. There is no reason why priests cannot have both.",
            "I don't have strong feelings against gay marriage. In my opinion, people are born a certain way, and they should not be blamed for who they are. It's not something they choose. I think it's unfair to say people can get married if they are a man and a woman, but not if they are two people of the same sex.\n\nIt seems that being gay is not a choice. People are born to be straight or gay. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they can change.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of law or morality. I don't think the government should tell people who they can or cannot marry.\n\nI don't think people who are gay should be blamed for who they are. They should be free to live their lives as they want.\n\nI don't think the federal government has the right to get involved in people's personal lives. It's not their place.\n\nIt's a difficult issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Some people think gay couples threaten the heterosexual family. But this is different. There are many different aspects to it, making it hard to compare.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads is not the same as tails. But it's like the same thing. Gay couples have the same civil rights as others. For example, they should have the same property taxes and health care.\n\nIf you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital unless they're considered family. This is unfair. If you're going to spend your life with someone, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship.\n\nThe issue is, gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government. If the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. Gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But children of gay couples are no different from those of straight couples. They need love and support, not fear and judgment.\n\nIn New York City, there are schools for children of gay parents because they face problems in public schools. They get bullied and parents protest to get them removed. This is unfair.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like straight couples. Parenting skills are not different.\n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against it is unfair. President Bush's views on gay marriage are based on his religion, but morality differs from person to person.\n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is hypocritical, especially when some people are against \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true, according to the American Psychological Association. People should listen to research, not popular opinion.",
            "I worked in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. \n\nI think a drug is not bad just because it is against the law. Some illegal drugs are used in hospitals because they are helpful. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances. We use them often because they are good for patients. We should not deny the benefits of marijuana just because many people do not think it is good. \n\nMany people think marijuana is bad. But it is not as bad as alcohol. If you use too much of either, you can have problems. \n\nI think we should make marijuana legal slowly, not all at once. If we do it too fast, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is bad, people might use it wisely. \n\nSome people have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. \n\nI do not think marijuana should be legal, but it should be used for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it used to be. I remember going to church every Sunday when I was young. I would get nice dresses and matching shoes. My friends and I would meet there on the weekends. Now, as I have grown older, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter service, just 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and jeans.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I have seen. The church I know does not discuss its politics, but I can see how it has changed. It is more casual now. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. Some men are married and still become pedophiles. Their behavior is not because of their marriage status. It is their choice to become priests. Some other religions allow priests to get married, so if they want to practice their faith and be married, they should choose a different church.\n\nI think being a pedophile is genetic. People are born with it, not because of how they are raised. You cannot hide it, and it usually comes out. The church cannot prevent it, but it should not try to cover it up if it knows about it.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea of invading Iraq at first. But I think people were still very upset about the September 11th attacks and we went to war for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Bush administration said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks. But all of this has been proven false.\n\nI am very angry about this. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now says he was not convinced by the evidence. I think this is wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration has no respect for the constitution and has tried to ignore it. They wanted to go to war before September 11th.\n\nA former Secretary of the Treasury said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's failed attempt. The younger Bush wanted to expand America's energy supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. But if we leave now, there will be problems. The country may fall into civil war and more people will die.\n\nThe US and the UN are trying to work together to bring order to Iraq.

            "I do not think it is right to make marijuana legal. The state should not decide this. It is up to the churches. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This is clear.\n\nMaking laws about marijuana would be against what the Constitution says.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But one did not have much to do with the other.\n\nThe government made it seem like that. They used the emotions of the American people in their anger about the terrorist attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003. I personally am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. It's a big tragedy. They were removing the country's government, but the American government was not prepared for the problems that would happen after that. They were trying to put a democratic government in place, but it's not easy. It's like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to remove the Communists and put in a democracy.\n\nThe US government should have known it would be a long and hard process. It was not a clear victory like they thought it would be. They were fighting against the people of Iraq, not an army. They were fighting against the citizens of the country. I think the government was not prepared for all the problems that would happen.\n\nIf you go to war, you need to plan for all the possible outcomes. I think the government was not prepared for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government. We are still in Iraq today, and many American troops are still dying. They are still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to control their own country. It's a long process.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful war. They made it seem like it would be easy to put in a democratic government. But it's not easy. Democracy is a long struggle. We should have learned from our own country's history.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. It's hard to decide what to do now that we've been there for so long. We took away their government and their way of life. How can we leave them now? But there's also the problem of the many American casualties. It's too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same thing in other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It's about the oil and controlling resources. Before going to war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We are not attacking countries like North Korea that we know have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But it's not likely.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. It has been proven that it could be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. This means that people should not be punished because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is unfair and inhumane to deny people rights because of their sexual orientation. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. It is a personal matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like everyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. He is trying to be God.\n\nI have read that some people are born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay. It is not something they choose. It is not because of how they were raised. For example, someone who has many sisters and no brothers may be gay. This is a biological reason, not a social one.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that affects the whole country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public and everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. I know this from my experience as a resident advisor. If you say something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. The internet is public, and many people will see what you say. If you are friends with someone on social media, you will see their messages. \n\nThe school cannot ignore things people say online. If someone hears something and reports it, the school must act. They cannot wait, or they might miss a chance to prevent a problem. \n\nBut it is hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. It could be an experiment gone wrong, like a sociology class project. Or it could be serious. \n\nIn this case, someone overheard a student saying something. They reported it, and the school found out who said it. They looked at the student's online profiles and saw things that could be serious. The student had posted things that might be jokes, but in this situation, people thought they were serious. \n\nWhen you put something online, you give up your privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. If you don't want people to think something of you, don't post it. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not look at their private messages and profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they must take it seriously. If it is a danger, they must act.\n\nI don't think teachers should make fake social media accounts to friend their students. That is not right. As a resident advisor, I don't want to know if my residents are doing things they shouldn't be doing. I don't want to see their pictures on social media. I don't want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nI believe the original purpose was good: to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are now fighting just to show we are powerful. \nI also think the motives may have been questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we were fighting to give democracy to a country, that would be fine. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it was not right. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I don't think that's why we are fighting now. \nOur reasons have changed. \nWe're fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe country's leaders will have to take care of themselves soon. \nThat time has come. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe should use that money to help our own country. \nWe have problems with poverty and roads and schools that need fixing. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important to us. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \nWe have many problems to solve at home. \nWe should use our money to help our own people. \nRight now, our money is being used to kill our own citizens in a war that is not important to us.",
            "I have a question about something that happened recently.\n\nSomeone found out about it because they looked it up on the internet. They used a site called Myspace. When you join Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile. But when you are friends, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, it is like sending a message to everyone. Many people can see what you say. So when someone saw this information, it helped stop a bad situation.\n\nBut it is hard to have one person check all of the profiles to prevent problems. It would be unfair to look at some students and not others. Also, it would be too much work for one person to look at all of the profiles.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that there are people who can see things about me without my permission. I saw a show once about someone who found a girl's screen name and talked to her in just a few minutes. It is hard to know who is really your friend on the internet.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it is hard. The point of having Facebook is to talk to friends. But you never know who can see what you say. My roommate told me that her school once banned students from having Myspace accounts. I don't know if that is right. Schools should not have the power to tell students what they can and cannot have on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad talking about it because many people already disagree with the war. I was also against it from the beginning. But it's not that important now. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people in the world think so, including seventy percent of US troops in Iraq.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was very bad before the US went in. Now, pulling out is also a problem. There is no easy answer for this situation. It's like a big cultural difference between the US and Middle Eastern countries. Americans think they can bring democracy to Iraq, but the Iraqis might not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we had to think carefully before invading his country. The war has been a disaster. I do not see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. If the US wants to leave gradually, I wouldn't mind. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now.\n\nMost Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. They know their country better than the US. If we leave and things get bad, we can say we followed their wishes. If we stay and things get bad, we will be blamed.\n\nI do not think we can be the good guys in the Middle East. But leaving would be better than staying where we are now.",
            "I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States.  This is not just about women, but about the job field as well.  Most people find it hard to work under a woman because society has been raised for a long time that men are in charge.\n\nWomen often see a job they can do well, but may not be chosen for it because it's not seen that women are in high places in business.  The same thing happens to men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  Society looks down on men who stay home with their children, even if it's their dream. \n\nIn the fashion industry, people do not take straight men seriously.  They think if you're a man in fashion, you probably have a different lifestyle, so how can you really know about fashion for women?  Depending on the job field, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set mindset.  But we are making progress.  Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business.  More men are staying home to take care of their children, and people are starting to accept that.  We just need to promote the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being too pushy.  If we do this too fast, people will resist.  We have come a long way, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they are from or their grammar.  If someone from a farm with poor grammar but good intelligence tries to become a CEO, other men may look down on them because they don't think they can express themselves well.",
            "I think what happened in this place is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it less serious. \nThey changed it from a crime to something like a traffic ticket. \nYou can get in trouble, but it is not as bad as before. \nIf you get caught, you will get a ticket. \nThis is good because it will not affect your future as much. \nBut at the same time, there are some problems. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and keep people in jail. \nAnd it costs money to take them to court and for them to have a lawyer. \nSo, if a city is in financial trouble, they might not want to do this. \nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay. \nAnd it is true that they have more money to spend on important things. \nThey can spend it on education, help for old people, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nI think it is a good idea. \nBut there are some problems. \nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it everywhere. \nThey might drive while smoking, which is not safe. \nAnd it is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSome people do not want it to be legal. \nThey think it will be a problem.\n\nI do not know what to think. \nBut I think marijuana can be bad for some people. \nIt can affect their judgment and their lifestyle. \nBut it is not the same for everyone. \nSome people can handle it, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say for sure.",
            "I agree. Here's why. \n\nMany things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to change with times.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are not the same religion. My dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church would not marry them. This is not very tolerant of other religions.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic school. This is a Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them.\n\nSo I think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but then the practice goes against it. This is because it's outdated. But they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from molesting children. If someone is going to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's different to be with a child than with a spouse.\n\nSo I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult problem. It is hard to decide without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is about the separation of church and state. It is also about how to define marriage. This is a very hard thing to do. It involves many people and many different ideas.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what kind of marriage is good or bad. I think it should just be about two people getting together and living together. They should not have to worry about what the government thinks about their marriage.\n\nPeople who are gay should be allowed to have the same rights as other couples. They should be able to get married and have the same tax breaks and other benefits. It is not fair to treat them differently.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nWe should not change the constitution just to make one group of people unhappy. We should let people live their lives as they want. \n\nI do not support a ban on gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a confusing issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with this lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think a democratic state will be in favor of gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should decide if they want to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run. Some things should be left to each individual state. President Bush will leave office in a few years. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be changed. Each state should decide for itself because they will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have any other thoughts on this subject.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials' actions. They went on the internet to see if students were doing anything wrong. Myspace is a public place. If students post things there, they should be prepared for others to see them. The school officials could see the information even if it was not under the school's name.\n\nThey can still find it at home. And if it helps prevent a school shooting, I think that is a good reason to look. Students are a school's responsibility. If school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing something wrong, they are doing their job. I do not think this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut I do think it is an invasion of privacy if they go on the internet just to catch students doing something wrong. They are trying to catch students in trouble. I do not think this is right. If they are looking for a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself when you write. I do not think it is right for students to post things on the internet that they do not want others to see. If you post something on the internet, it will always be there. If you do something wrong, you will get in trouble.\n\nI do not think that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion of privacy. Other officials, like the police, can also go on the internet if they have a good reason.\n\nWhen parents drop off their children at school, they think the school is a safe place. The school officials were trying to make the school safer. They were practicing things like lock downs in case of a school shooting. This is like the Columbine incident. I think the school officials were doing their job.",
            "I was for the war, but now I am against it. \nI was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI wanted to fight back and hurt those who caused it. \nBut, I think we went to war without a good plan. \nWe did not think about what could happen later. \nWe just acted on our feelings, not on a plan. \nNow, I think the war did not help. \nThe people over there are fighting each other. \nThey cannot fight against us if they fight each other. \nI do not care about what happens to them anymore. \nSometimes, I think they are not human. \nThey are very different from us. They fight all the time and do not try to make their country better. \nThey just want us to leave. \nI think we should leave them alone. \nWe went to war without knowing what to expect. \nWar is different for them than it is for us. \nThey are very aggressive and do not care about their country. \nI think we should have thought more before going to war. \nWe were not thinking clearly. \nWe wanted revenge. \nPresident Bush wanted to go to war because many people wanted it. \nHe declared war on Iraq without a good plan. \nI think we had to go to war, but we could have done it better. \nWe did not have a clear plan to create order. \nWe were not united. \nWe did not know why we were fighting. \nI think a clear plan would have helped us. \nWe went to war with anger and emotion. \nThat caused problems in Iraq. \nI do not think we can change the people in Iraq. \nThey will always be the same. \nI do not think we should stay in Iraq. \nWe have made some progress, but not enough. \nIraq will collapse when we leave. \nStaying in Iraq is hurting us. \nWe should leave and let them handle their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not accepting of many things. The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are old-fashioned and many people do not agree with them. \n\nIf the Church changed its views, it would not lose its following. Many people are against the Church because it does not agree with them on certain subjects. The Church teaches that abortion is wrong, so people who support abortion will not be comfortable following the Church. The same is true for gay marriage.\n\nThe Church is also against women priests and married priests. But this may not have changed the problems the Church is facing. We do not know if married priests or female priests would have made a difference.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but this does not mean they cannot have families. Many people have jobs and families. There is no reason why priests cannot have both.",
            "I don't have strong feelings against gay marriage. In my opinion, people are born a certain way, and they should not be blamed for who they are. It's not something they choose. I think it's unfair to say people can get married if they are a man and a woman, but not if they are two people of the same sex.\n\nIt seems that being gay is not a choice. People are born to be straight or gay. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they can change.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of law or morality. I don't think the government should tell people who they can or cannot marry.\n\nI don't think people who are gay should be blamed for who they are. They should be free to live their lives as they want.\n\nI don't think the federal government has the right to get involved in people's personal lives. It's not their place.\n\nIt's a difficult issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Some people think gay couples threaten the heterosexual family. But this is different. There are many different aspects to it, making it hard to compare.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads is not the same as tails. But it's like the same thing. Gay couples have the same civil rights as others. For example, they should have the same property taxes and health care.\n\nIf you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital unless they're considered family. This is unfair. If you're going to spend your life with someone, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship.\n\nThe issue is, gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government. If the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. Gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But children of gay couples are no different from those of straight couples. They need love and support, not fear and judgment.\n\nIn New York City, there are schools for children of gay parents because they face problems in public schools. They get bullied and parents protest to get them removed. This is unfair.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like straight couples. Parenting skills are not different.\n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against it is unfair. President Bush's views on gay marriage are based on his religion, but morality differs from person to person.\n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is hypocritical, especially when some people are against \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true, according to the American Psychological Association. People should listen to research, not popular opinion.",
            "I worked in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. \n\nI think a drug is not bad just because it is against the law. Some illegal drugs are used in hospitals because they are helpful. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances. We use them often because they are good for patients. We should not deny the benefits of marijuana just because many people do not think it is good. \n\nMany people think marijuana is bad. But it is not as bad as alcohol. If you use too much of either, you can have problems. \n\nI think we should make marijuana legal slowly, not all at once. If we do it too fast, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is bad, people might use it wisely. \n\nSome people have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. \n\nI do not think marijuana should be legal, but it should be used for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it used to be. I remember going to church every Sunday when I was young. I would get nice dresses and matching shoes. My friends and I would meet there on the weekends. Now, as I have grown older, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter service, just 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and jeans.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I have seen. The church I know does not discuss its politics, but I can see how it has changed. It is more casual now. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. Some men are married and still become pedophiles. Their behavior is not because of their marriage status. It is their choice to become priests. Some other religions allow priests to get married, so if they want to practice their faith and be married, they should choose a different church.\n\nI think being a pedophile is genetic. People are born with it, not because of how they are raised. You cannot hide it, and it usually comes out. The church cannot prevent it, but it should not try to cover it up if it knows about it.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea of invading Iraq at first. But I think people were still very upset about the September 11th attacks and we went to war for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Bush administration said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks. But all of this has been proven false.\n\nI am very angry about this. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now says he was not convinced by the evidence. I think this is wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration has no respect for the constitution and has tried to ignore it. They wanted to go to war before September 11th.\n\nA former Secretary of the Treasury said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's failed attempt. The younger Bush wanted to expand America's energy supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. But if we leave now, there will be problems. The country may fall into civil war and more people will die.\n\nThe US and the UN are trying to work together to bring order to Iraq.

            "I do not think it is right to make marijuana legal. The state should not decide this. It is up to the churches. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This is clear.\n\nMaking laws about marijuana would be against what the Constitution says.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But one did not have much to do with the other.\n\nThe government made it seem like that. They used the emotions of the American people in their anger about the terrorist attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003. I personally am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. It's a big tragedy. They were removing the country's government, but the American government was not prepared for the problems that would happen after that. They were trying to put a democratic government in place, but it's not easy. It's like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to remove the Communists and put in a democracy.\n\nThe US government should have known it would be a long and hard process. It was not a clear victory like they thought it would be. They were fighting against the people of Iraq, not an army. They were fighting against the citizens of the country. I think the government was not prepared for all the problems that would happen.\n\nIf you go to war, you need to plan for all the possible outcomes. I think the government was not prepared for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government. We are still in Iraq today, and many American troops are still dying. They are still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to control their own country. It's a long process.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful war. They made it seem like it would be easy to put in a democratic government. But it's not easy. Democracy is a long struggle. We should have learned from our own country's history.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. It's hard to decide what to do now that we've been there for so long. We took away their government and their way of life. How can we leave them now? But there's also the problem of the many American casualties. It's too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same thing in other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It's about the oil and controlling resources. Before going to war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We are not attacking countries like North Korea that we know have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But it's not likely.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. It has been proven that it could be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. This means that people should not be punished because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is unfair and inhumane to deny people rights because of their sexual orientation. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. It is a personal matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like everyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. He is trying to be God.\n\nI have read that some people are born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay. It is not something they choose. It is not because of how they were raised. For example, someone who has many sisters and no brothers may be gay. This is a biological reason, not a social one.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that affects the whole country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public and everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. I know this from my experience as a resident advisor. If you say something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. The internet is public, and many people will see what you say. If you are friends with someone on social media, you will see their messages. \n\nThe school cannot ignore things people say online. If someone hears something and reports it, the school must act. They cannot wait, or they might miss a chance to prevent a problem. \n\nBut it is hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. It could be an experiment gone wrong, like a sociology class project. Or it could be serious. \n\nIn this case, someone overheard a student saying something. They reported it, and the school found out who said it. They looked at the student's online profiles and saw things that could be serious. The student had posted things that might be jokes, but in this situation, people thought they were serious. \n\nWhen you put something online, you give up your privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. If you don't want people to think something of you, don't post it. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not look at their private messages and profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they must take it seriously. If it is a danger, they must act.\n\nI don't think teachers should make fake social media accounts to friend their students. That is not right. As a resident advisor, I don't want to know if my residents are doing things they shouldn't be doing. I don't want to see their pictures on social media. I don't want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nI believe the original purpose was good: to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are now fighting just to show we are powerful. \nI also think the motives may have been questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we were fighting to give democracy to a country, that would be fine. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it was not right. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I don't think that's why we are fighting now. \nOur reasons have changed. \nWe're fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe country's leaders will have to take care of themselves soon. \nThat time has come. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe should use that money to help our own country. \nWe have problems with poverty and roads and schools that need fixing. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important to us. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \nWe have many problems to solve at home. \nWe should use our money to help our own people. \nRight now, our money is being used to kill our own citizens in a war that is not important to us.",
            "I have a question about something that happened recently.\n\nSomeone found out about it because they looked it up on the internet. They used a site called Myspace. When you join Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile. But when you are friends, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, it is like sending a message to everyone. Many people can see what you say. So when someone saw this information, it helped stop a bad situation.\n\nBut it is hard to have one person check all of the profiles to prevent problems. It would be unfair to look at some students and not others. Also, it would be too much work for one person to look at all of the profiles.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that there are people who can see things about me without my permission. I saw a show once about someone who found a girl's screen name and talked to her in just a few minutes. It is hard to know who is really your friend on the internet.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it is hard. The point of having Facebook is to talk to friends. But you never know who can see what you say. My roommate told me that her school once banned students from having Myspace accounts. I don't know if that is right. Schools should not have the power to tell students what they can and cannot have on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad talking about it because many people already disagree with the war. I was also against it from the beginning. But it's not that important now. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people in the world think so, including seventy percent of US troops in Iraq.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was very bad before the US went in. Now, pulling out is also a problem. There is no easy answer for this situation. It's like a big cultural difference between the US and Middle Eastern countries. Americans think they can bring democracy to Iraq, but the Iraqis might not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we had to think carefully before invading his country. The war has been a disaster. I do not see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. If the US wants to leave gradually, I wouldn't mind. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now.\n\nMost Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. They know their country better than the US. If we leave and things get bad, we can say we followed their wishes. If we stay and things get bad, we will be blamed.\n\nI do not think we can be the good guys in the Middle East. But leaving would be better than staying where we are now.",
            "I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States.  This is not just about women, but about the job field as well.  Most people find it hard to work under a woman because society has been raised for a long time that men are in charge.\n\nWomen often see a job they can do well, but may not be chosen for it because it's not seen that women are in high places in business.  The same thing happens to men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  Society looks down on men who stay home with their children, even if it's their dream. \n\nIn the fashion industry, people do not take straight men seriously.  They think if you're a man in fashion, you probably have a different lifestyle, so how can you really know about fashion for women?  Depending on the job field, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set mindset.  But we are making progress.  Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business.  More men are staying home to take care of their children, and people are starting to accept that.  We just need to promote the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being too pushy.  If we do this too fast, people will resist.  We have come a long way, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they are from or their grammar.  If someone from a farm with poor grammar but good intelligence tries to become a CEO, other men may look down on them because they don't think they can express themselves well.",
            "I think what happened in this place is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it less serious. \nThey changed it from a crime to something like a traffic ticket. \nYou can get in trouble, but it is not as bad as before. \nIf you get caught, you will get a ticket. \nThis is good because it will not affect your future as much. \nBut at the same time, there are some problems. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and keep people in jail. \nAnd it costs money to take them to court and for them to have a lawyer. \nSo, if a city is in financial trouble, they might not want to do this. \nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay. \nAnd it is true that they have more money to spend on important things. \nThey can spend it on education, help for old people, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nI think it is a good idea. \nBut there are some problems. \nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it everywhere. \nThey might drive while smoking, which is not safe. \nAnd it is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSome people do not want it to be legal. \nThey think it will be a problem.\n\nI do not know what to think. \nBut I think marijuana can be bad for some people. \nIt can affect their judgment and their lifestyle. \nBut it is not the same for everyone. \nSome people can handle it, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say for sure.",
            "I agree. Here's why. \n\nMany things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to change with times.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are not the same religion. My dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church would not marry them. This is not very tolerant of other religions.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic school. This is a Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them.\n\nSo I think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but then the practice goes against it. This is because it's outdated. But they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from molesting children. If someone is going to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's different to be with a child than with a spouse.\n\nSo I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult problem. It is hard to decide without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is about the separation of church and state. It is also about how to define marriage. This is a very hard thing to do. It involves many people and many different ideas.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what kind of marriage is good or bad. I think it should just be about two people getting together and living together. They should not have to worry about what the government thinks about their marriage.\n\nPeople who are gay should be allowed to have the same rights as other couples. They should be able to get married and have the same tax breaks and other benefits. It is not fair to treat them differently.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nWe should not change the constitution just to make one group of people unhappy. We should let people live their lives as they want. \n\nI do not support a ban on gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a confusing issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with this lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think a democratic state will be in favor of gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should decide if they want to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run. Some things should be left to each individual state. President Bush will leave office in a few years. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be changed. Each state should decide for itself because they will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have any other thoughts on this subject.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials' actions. They went on the internet to see if students were doing anything wrong. Myspace is a public place. If students post things there, they should be prepared for others to see them. The school officials could see the information even if it was not under the school's name.\n\nThey can still find it at home. And if it helps prevent a school shooting, I think that is a good reason to look. Students are a school's responsibility. If school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing something wrong, they are doing their job. I do not think this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut I do think it is an invasion of privacy if they go on the internet just to catch students doing something wrong. They are trying to catch students in trouble. I do not think this is right. If they are looking for a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself when you write. I do not think it is right for students to post things on the internet that they do not want others to see. If you post something on the internet, it will always be there. If you do something wrong, you will get in trouble.\n\nI do not think that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion of privacy. Other officials, like the police, can also go on the internet if they have a good reason.\n\nWhen parents drop off their children at school, they think the school is a safe place. The school officials were trying to make the school safer. They were practicing things like lock downs in case of a school shooting. This is like the Columbine incident. I think the school officials were doing their job.",
            "I was for the war, but now I am against it. \nI was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI wanted to fight back and hurt those who caused it. \nBut, I think we went to war without a good plan. \nWe did not think about what could happen later. \nWe just acted on our feelings, not on a plan. \nNow, I think the war did not help. \nThe people over there are fighting each other. \nThey cannot fight against us if they fight each other. \nI do not care about what happens to them anymore. \nSometimes, I think they are not human. \nThey are very different from us. They fight all the time and do not try to make their country better. \nThey just want us to leave. \nI think we should leave them alone. \nWe went to war without knowing what to expect. \nWar is different for them than it is for us. \nThey are very aggressive and do not care about their country. \nI think we should have thought more before going to war. \nWe were not thinking clearly. \nWe wanted revenge. \nPresident Bush wanted to go to war because many people wanted it. \nHe declared war on Iraq without a good plan. \nI think we had to go to war, but we could have done it better. \nWe did not have a clear plan to create order. \nWe were not united. \nWe did not know why we were fighting. \nI think a clear plan would have helped us. \nWe went to war with anger and emotion. \nThat caused problems in Iraq. \nI do not think we can change the people in Iraq. \nThey will always be the same. \nI do not think we should stay in Iraq. \nWe have made some progress, but not enough. \nIraq will collapse when we leave. \nStaying in Iraq is hurting us. \nWe should leave and let them handle their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not accepting of many things. The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion and birth control. These views are old-fashioned and many people do not agree with them. \n\nIf the Church changed its views, it would not lose its following. Many people are against the Church because it does not agree with them on certain subjects. The Church teaches that abortion is wrong, so people who support abortion will not be comfortable following the Church. The same is true for gay marriage.\n\nThe Church is also against women priests and married priests. But this may not have changed the problems the Church is facing. We do not know if married priests or female priests would have made a difference.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God, but this does not mean they cannot have families. Many people have jobs and families. There is no reason why priests cannot have both.",
            "I don't have strong feelings against gay marriage. In my opinion, people are born a certain way, and they should not be blamed for who they are. It's not something they choose. I think it's unfair to say people can get married if they are a man and a woman, but not if they are two people of the same sex.\n\nIt seems that being gay is not a choice. People are born to be straight or gay. I was born straight, and others are born gay. It's not something they can change.\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of law or morality. I don't think the government should tell people who they can or cannot marry.\n\nI don't think people who are gay should be blamed for who they are. They should be free to live their lives as they want.\n\nI don't think the federal government has the right to get involved in people's personal lives. It's not their place.\n\nIt's a difficult issue.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why.\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Some people think gay couples threaten the heterosexual family. But this is different. There are many different aspects to it, making it hard to compare.\n\nIt's like two sides of the same coin. Heads is not the same as tails. But it's like the same thing. Gay couples have the same civil rights as others. For example, they should have the same property taxes and health care.\n\nIf you're in a gay couple, your partner can't visit you in the hospital unless they're considered family. This is unfair. If you're going to spend your life with someone, you should have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same factors that contribute to a happy relationship.\n\nThe issue is, gay couples aren't asking for a church wedding. They want a marriage certificate from the government. If the government gives a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. Gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But children of gay couples are no different from those of straight couples. They need love and support, not fear and judgment.\n\nIn New York City, there are schools for children of gay parents because they face problems in public schools. They get bullied and parents protest to get them removed. This is unfair.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like straight couples. Parenting skills are not different.\n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The amendment against it is unfair. President Bush's views on gay marriage are based on his religion, but morality differs from person to person.\n\nThe government should not enforce one group's morality on the whole country. This is hypocritical, especially when some people are against \"under God\" in the pledge of allegiance.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true, according to the American Psychological Association. People should listen to research, not popular opinion.",
            "I worked in a hospital pharmacy over the summer. \n\nI think a drug is not bad just because it is against the law. Some illegal drugs are used in hospitals because they are helpful. \n\nFor example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances. We use them often because they are good for patients. We should not deny the benefits of marijuana just because many people do not think it is good. \n\nMany people think marijuana is bad. But it is not as bad as alcohol. If you use too much of either, you can have problems. \n\nI think we should make marijuana legal slowly, not all at once. If we do it too fast, people might misuse it. But if we remove the idea that marijuana is bad, people might use it wisely. \n\nSome people have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly. \n\nI do not think marijuana should be legal, but it should be used for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed with the times. It is not as strict as it used to be. I remember going to church every Sunday when I was young. I would get nice dresses and matching shoes. My friends and I would meet there on the weekends. Now, as I have grown older, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter service, just 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes and jeans.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I have seen. The church I know does not discuss its politics, but I can see how it has changed. It is more casual now. Even at morning masses, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. Some men are married and still become pedophiles. Their behavior is not because of their marriage status. It is their choice to become priests. Some other religions allow priests to get married, so if they want to practice their faith and be married, they should choose a different church.\n\nI think being a pedophile is genetic. People are born with it, not because of how they are raised. You cannot hide it, and it usually comes out. The church cannot prevent it, but it should not try to cover it up if it knows about it.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea of invading Iraq at first. But I think people were still very upset about the September 11th attacks and we went to war for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe Bush administration said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. They said Saddam Hussein was connected to Osama Bin Laden and the September 11th attacks. But all of this has been proven false.\n\nI am very angry about this. I think the Bush administration lied to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who presented evidence at the UN, now says he was not convinced by the evidence. I think this is wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration has no respect for the constitution and has tried to ignore it. They wanted to go to war before September 11th.\n\nA former Secretary of the Treasury said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's failed attempt. The younger Bush wanted to expand America's energy supply.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. But if we leave now, there will be problems. The country may fall into civil war and more people will die.\n\nThe US and the UN are trying to work together to bring order to Iraq.

            "I do not think it is right to make marijuana legal. The state should not decide this. It is up to the churches. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This is clear.\n\nMaking laws about marijuana would be against what the Constitution says.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the government was not honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before invading Iraq, I think there was an attempt to connect the invasion to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. But one did not have much to do with the other.\n\nThe government made it seem like that. They used the emotions of the American people in their anger about the terrorist attacks. The invasion of Iraq began in 2003. I personally am against war, especially a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq is like the Vietnam War in many ways. The government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in the war. It's a big tragedy. They were removing the country's government, but the American government was not prepared for the problems that would happen after that. They were trying to put a democratic government in place, but it's not easy. It's like what happened in Vietnam, where they tried to remove the Communists and put in a democracy.\n\nThe US government should have known it would be a long and hard process. It was not a clear victory like they thought it would be. They were fighting against the people of Iraq, not an army. They were fighting against the citizens of the country. I think the government was not prepared for all the problems that would happen.\n\nIf you go to war, you need to plan for all the possible outcomes. I think the government was not prepared for what would happen after they removed the Iraqi government. We are still in Iraq today, and many American troops are still dying. They are still trying to train the Iraqi troops and police to be able to control their own country. It's a long process.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people into thinking it would be a short and successful war. They made it seem like it would be easy to put in a democratic government. But it's not easy. Democracy is a long struggle. We should have learned from our own country's history.\n\nThe war in Iraq is a difficult decision to make. It's hard to decide what to do now that we've been there for so long. We took away their government and their way of life. How can we leave them now? But there's also the problem of the many American casualties. It's too much to risk for a free democratic Iraq.\n\nIf we're invading Iraq to make it a democratic nation, why aren't we doing the same thing in other countries? I think the big reason is the oil issue. It's about the oil and controlling resources. Before going to war, they said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but none were ever found. We are not attacking countries like North Korea that we know have weapons of mass destruction.\n\nI just hope the war ends soon and there is peace in Iraq. But it's not likely.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. It has been proven that it could be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. This means that people should not be punished because of something they cannot control.\n\nI think it is unfair and inhumane to deny people rights because of their sexual orientation. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. It is a personal matter, not a state or national issue. In my neighborhood, there are several openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to be. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs, just like everyone else.\n\nI think it is ridiculous for President Bush to try to decide what marriage means. He is trying to be God.\n\nI have read that some people are born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay. It is not something they choose. It is not because of how they were raised. For example, someone who has many sisters and no brothers may be gay. This is a biological reason, not a social one.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it in secret. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big public issue. I think marriage should be a private, personal thing, not something that affects the whole country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public and everyone can see it. You cannot control who sees it. I know this from my experience as a resident advisor. If you say something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. The internet is public, and many people will see what you say. If you are friends with someone on social media, you will see their messages. \n\nThe school cannot ignore things people say online. If someone hears something and reports it, the school must act. They cannot wait, or they might miss a chance to prevent a problem. \n\nBut it is hard to know what to believe. Some people just joke around online. It could be an experiment gone wrong, like a sociology class project. Or it could be serious. \n\nIn this case, someone overheard a student saying something. They reported it, and the school found out who said it. They looked at the student's online profiles and saw things that could be serious. The student had posted things that might be jokes, but in this situation, people thought they were serious. \n\nWhen you put something online, you give up your privacy. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it online. If you don't want people to think something of you, don't post it. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not look at their private messages and profiles. But if someone brings something to their attention, they must take it seriously. If it is a danger, they must act.\n\nI don't think teachers should make fake social media accounts to friend their students. That is not right. As a resident advisor, I don't want to know if my residents are doing things they shouldn't be doing. I don't want to see their pictures on social media. I don't want to have to deal with it.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nI believe the original purpose was good: to bring democracy to another country. \nBut I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are now fighting just to show we are powerful. \nI also think the motives may have been questionable from the start. \nGeorge Bush's father had problems with Saddam Hussein. \nIf we were fighting to give democracy to a country, that would be fine. \nBut if there were personal reasons, it was not right. \nI think we made our point in the first few months. \nBut the war has lasted for many years. \nThat's too long.\n\nIf our goal was to give democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. \nBut I don't think that's why we are fighting now. \nOur reasons have changed. \nWe're fighting just to fight. \nWe don't want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war has lasted too long. \nThe country's leaders will have to take care of themselves soon. \nThat time has come. \nWe are spending too much money on this war. \nWe should use that money to help our own country. \nWe have problems with poverty and roads and schools that need fixing. \nWe should spend our money on those things, not on a war that is not important to us. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. \nWar should not be in our budget for a long time. \nWe have many problems to solve at home. \nWe should use our money to help our own people. \nRight now, our money is being used to kill our own citizens in a war that is not important to us.",
            "I have a question about something that happened recently.\n\nSomeone found out about it because they looked it up on the internet. They used a site called Myspace. When you join Myspace, you have to let someone be your friend to see your profile. But when you are friends, you are giving them permission to see your information.\n\nWhen you put things on the internet, it is like sending a message to everyone. Many people can see what you say. So when someone saw this information, it helped stop a bad situation.\n\nBut it is hard to have one person check all of the profiles to prevent problems. It would be unfair to look at some students and not others. Also, it would be too much work for one person to look at all of the profiles.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that there are people who can see things about me without my permission. I saw a show once about someone who found a girl's screen name and talked to her in just a few minutes. It is hard to know who is really your friend on the internet.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but it is hard. The point of having Facebook is to talk to friends. But you never know who can see what you say. My roommate told me that her school once banned students from having Myspace accounts. I don't know if that is right. Schools should not have the power to tell students what they can and cannot have on the internet.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I feel bad talking about it because many people already disagree with the war. I was also against it from the beginning. But it's not that important now. Most people in the world think the war was a bad idea. Seventy-five to eighty percent of people in the world think so, including seventy percent of US troops in Iraq.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was very bad before the US went in. Now, pulling out is also a problem. There is no easy answer for this situation. It's like a big cultural difference between the US and Middle Eastern countries. Americans think they can bring democracy to Iraq, but the Iraqis might not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we had to think carefully before invading his country. The war has been a disaster. I do not see a reason for the US to stay in Iraq. If the US wants to leave gradually, I wouldn't mind. But I don't see a reason why we can't leave now.\n\nMost Iraqis want the US to leave within a year. They know their country better than the US. If we leave and things get bad, we can say we followed their wishes. If we stay and things get bad, we will be blamed.\n\nI do not think we can be the good guys in the Middle East. But leaving would be better than staying where we are now.",
            "I think there is still gender discrimination in the United States.  This is not just about women, but about the job field as well.  Most people find it hard to work under a woman because society has been raised for a long time that men are in charge.\n\nWomen often see a job they can do well, but may not be chosen for it because it's not seen that women are in high places in business.  The same thing happens to men in certain industries like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent.  Society looks down on men who stay home with their children, even if it's their dream. \n\nIn the fashion industry, people do not take straight men seriously.  They think if you're a man in fashion, you probably have a different lifestyle, so how can you really know about fashion for women?  Depending on the job field, there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S.\n\nChanging this is hard because society has a set mindset.  But we are making progress.  Women are becoming CEOs and getting more accepted in business.  More men are staying home to take care of their children, and people are starting to accept that.  We just need to promote the good qualities of people who are stereotyped against, without being too pushy.  If we do this too fast, people will resist.  We have come a long way, and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against based on where they are from or their grammar.  If someone from a farm with poor grammar but good intelligence tries to become a CEO, other men may look down on them because they don't think they can express themselves well.",
            "I think what happened in this place is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it less serious. \nThey changed it from a crime to something like a traffic ticket. \nYou can get in trouble, but it is not as bad as before. \nIf you get caught, you will get a ticket. \nThis is good because it will not affect your future as much. \nBut at the same time, there are some problems. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and keep people in jail. \nAnd it costs money to take them to court and for them to have a lawyer. \nSo, if a city is in financial trouble, they might not want to do this. \nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay. \nAnd it is true that they have more money to spend on important things. \nThey can spend it on education, help for old people, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nI think it is a good idea. \nBut there are some problems. \nIf marijuana is legal, people might smoke it everywhere. \nThey might drive while smoking, which is not safe. \nAnd it is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSome people do not want it to be legal. \nThey think it will be a problem.\n\nI do not know what to think. \nBut I think marijuana can be bad for some people. \nIt can affect their judgment and their lifestyle. \nBut it is not the same for everyone. \nSome people can handle it, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say for sure.",
            "I agree. Here's why. \n\nMany things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It's good to be rooted in tradition. But it's also important to change with times.\n\nSome Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are not the same religion. My dad was Episcopalian. The Catholic Church would not marry them. This is not very tolerant of other religions.\n\nWe always learned to love others in Catholic school. This is a Catholic teaching. But it's hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them.\n\nSo I think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but then the practice goes against it. This is because it's outdated. But they continue to do it anyway.\n\nI don't think allowing priests to marry would stop them from molesting children. If someone is going to do something bad, they will do it anyway. It's different to be with a child than with a spouse.\n\nSo I don't think allowing priests to be married would prevent these bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made a decision yet. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. But I think this is a difficult problem. It is hard to decide without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is about the separation of church and state. It is also about how to define marriage. This is a very hard thing to do. It involves many people and many different ideas.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what kind of marriage is good or bad. I think it should just be about two people getting together and living together. They should not have to worry about what the government thinks about their marriage.\n\nPeople who are gay should be allowed to have the same rights as other couples. They should be able to get married and have the same tax breaks and other benefits. It is not fair to treat them differently.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, then the government should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough to change the constitution.\n\nWe should not change the constitution just to make one group of people unhappy. We should let people live their lives as they want. \n\nI do not support a ban on gay marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes homosexuality a confusing issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with this lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. I do not think it should be a national issue. I believe each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think a democratic state will be in favor of gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there. I think homosexuals should be treated the same as heterosexuals. Each state should decide if they want to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already answered that. I do not think President Bush should decide for the whole country. He does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state should be run. Some things should be left to each individual state. President Bush will leave office in a few years. If a new president wants to lift the ban on gay marriage, it will be changed. Each state should decide for itself because they will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have any other thoughts on this subject.",
            "I do not agree with the school officials' actions. They went on the internet to see if students were doing anything wrong. Myspace is a public place. If students post things there, they should be prepared for others to see them. The school officials could see the information even if it was not under the school's name.\n\nThey can still find it at home. And if it helps prevent a school shooting, I think that is a good reason to look. Students are a school's responsibility. If school officials go on the internet to see if students are doing something wrong, they are doing their job. I do not think this is an invasion of privacy.\n\nBut I do think it is an invasion of privacy if they go on the internet just to catch students doing something wrong. They are trying to catch students in trouble. I do not think this is right. If they are looking for a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself when you write. I do not think it is right for students to post things on the internet that they do not want others to see. If you post something on the internet, it will always be there. If you do something wrong, you will get in trouble.\n\nI do not think that school officials should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to make the school safer, I do not think that is an invasion of privacy. Other officials, like the police, can also go on the internet if they have a good reason.\n\nWhen parents drop off their children at school, they think the school is a safe place. The school officials were trying to make the school safer. They were practicing things like lock downs in case of a school shooting. This is like the Columbine incident. I think the school officials were doing their job.",
            "I was for the war, but now I am against it. \nI was personally affected by nine eleven. \nI wanted to fight back and hurt those who caused it. \nBut, I think we went to war without a good plan. \nWe did not think about what could happen later. \nWe just acted on our feelings, not on a plan. \nNow, I think the war did not help. \nThe people over there are fighting each other. \nThey cannot fight against us if they fight each other. \nI do not care about what happens to them anymore. \nSometimes, I think they are not human. \nThey are very different from us. They fight all the time and do not try to make their country better. \nThey just want us to leave. \nI think we should leave them alone. \nWe went to war without knowing what to expect. \nWar is different for them than it is for us. \nThey are very aggressive and do not care about their country. \nI think we should have thought more before going to war. \nWe were not thinking clearly. \nWe wanted revenge. \nPresident Bush wanted to go to war because many people wanted it. \nHe declared war on Iraq without a good plan. \nI think we had to go to war, but we could have done it better. \nWe did not have a clear plan to create order. \nWe were not united. \nWe did not know why we were fighting. \nI think a clear plan would have helped us. \nWe went to war with anger and emotion. \nThat caused problems in Iraq. \nI do not think we can change the people in Iraq. \nThey will always be the same. \nI do not think we should stay in Iraq. \nWe have made some progress, but not enough. \nIraq will collapse when we leave. \nStaying in Iraq is hurting us. \nWe should leave and let them handle their own problems."
