            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Catholic Church because it does not accept many things. The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. But these views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its thinking a little, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not permit abortion, so people who support abortion may not want to be a part of it. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you may not want to be in a group that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church should allow women to be priests and priests to be married. But this might not have stopped bad things from happening. It is hard to know for sure.\n\nPriests are said to be married to God. They are supposed to dedicate their lives to God. But other people work and have families, too. They have two lives. Priests should be able to have both.",

It's not a choice they make. We are all different. Some people are born straight, and some people are born gay. It's not something they can control.\n\nI think it's not fair to say that gay people made a wrong decision. They should not be punished for who they are. The federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security or morals. It's just about people being happy and being who they are.\n\nEveryone should have the right to get married. It's not fair to say no to people because of their sex. We should respect people's differences and not try to change them.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. There is no good reason not to. Many people think homosexuals threaten the traditional family. But that is not true. It is a different kind of relationship.\n\nGay couples are not the same as straight couples. But they are similar in many ways. They have the same kinds of relationships and the same goals.\n\nOne problem is that gay couples cannot get married in their community. They cannot be with their partner when they are sick or in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have been done on gay couples. They have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They are asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If the government allows them a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. We should be equal. Gay couples have the same problems as straight couples. They have the same kinds of relationships and the same issues.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children from gay couples are the same as children from straight couples. They need love and a home.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They go to those schools because they get bullied in public schools. This is not right.\n\nParents who are gay are the same as parents who are straight. They love their children and want the best for them.\n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. The law should be fair for everyone.\n\nBut President Bush has strong feelings about this. He believes it is against his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's beliefs. We should be fair to everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality problem. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to experts, not just what people think.\n\nWe should be fair and equal for everyone. Gay marriage should be allowed.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people think that just because a medicine is not allowed, it cannot be good. I do not agree. If a medicine is not allowed, it does not mean it has no good qualities. I think it should not be available for the public to use. But for medical use, I think it is okay.\n\nThere are many medicines that are not allowed, but we use them in pharmacies. They have good qualities. Oxycotton, Vicodin, and Perocets are examples. They are controlled substances, but we use them because they are helpful. I do not think marijuana should be treated differently just because there is a negative image around it.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you use marijuana a lot, it can be a problem. But so can alcohol. It is a difficult issue. I think we should allow marijuana, but we should not do it suddenly. We should add it to the list of allowed medicines gradually. This way, people will not use it too much.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as other medicines like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the bad image, people might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict now as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was a tradition for me.\n\nI went to a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends. Now, the church has made a shorter service for teenagers called a \"teenager mass.\" It lasts only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes. Even for morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. I do not know much about the church's politics. But I think this is how I see the church now.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think allowing them to marry or have women priests would have prevented pedophilia. There are married men who are still pedophiles. Their attraction to young children is not because they are allowed to marry or not marry. It is a person's choice to become a priest. Some religions allow priests to marry, like the Seventh Heaven church.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it is not their decision to choose. I do not think the church could have prevented these problems. If they knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was originally okay with the idea. But after the September 11th attacks, I think the US went to war in Iraq for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration made a big mistake by lying to the American people. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, said later that he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the United Nations. This is not good for a leader. It is wrong to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to limit its power since September 11th. I believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to take control of their oil.\n\nThe US has been in Iraq too long. If we leave now, there could be more fighting and more deaths. But I also do not think it is right to stay. The US is working with other countries in the region to bring order to Iraq. But I am not sure this will work. Iraq's government is weak, and there are many groups fighting for power.\n\nThe US used to be in charge, but now the Iraqi government has some control. But the parliament is not working well.

            "I have thoughts about the War in Iraq. At first, I think it's pointless. The war was not declared by the U.S. Congress. I believe the reason we went to war was because Iraq was blamed for the September 11 attacks. But I do not think it's a big issue that I keep up with.\n\nI know that the U.S. is trying to build democracy in Iraq so it can be like the U.S. But this takes a long time. We also want to get oil from Iraq. However, staying there makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to try and create democracy, but this will take a long time.\n\nIf we leave, people in Iraq will be angry with us because we caused problems and now they have to start over. It's a hard decision.\n\nI think the war should continue, but it's not a real war because Congress did not declare it. We use guns to show we are a strong country. I think we should help Iraq, but it's also wasting our resources.\n\nIt's hard for me to say I want the war to end because I know families in the U.S. have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe. But if we stay in Iraq, we will try to change them into a second United States, and it will be hard for them.\n\nThe war is also making people hate the U.S. more. Iraq has a different culture than the U.S. If we try to change them, it will be worse for them. I think the war will go on for a long time.",

            "I support gay marriage. I have always believed in it. I think it is a personal preference. Many studies show that being gay may be a natural part of a person's biology, not something they choose. This makes it unfair to deny them equal rights. I think it is inhumane to treat people unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI do not think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice, not something for the government to decide. It is not just a state issue, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to. But they live like any other family: they walk their dogs and go about their daily lives.\n\nI think it is wrong for the government to try to decide what marriage means. It is like trying to play God. I do not think it is right to deny people their rights because of who they love.\n\nMany studies show that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. It is not something a person chooses, but something they are born with. For example, a person may be gay even if they grow up with sisters and no father. This shows that being gay is not a choice.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that it is a public issue. But if a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something for the government to decide.\n\nI do not think anyone should be denied the right to get married because of who they love. I support gay marriage.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes public. Everyone can see it. It is not private. As an R.A., I have dealt with this situation before. \n\nIf you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, someone might take it seriously. You should not put that kind of information on the internet. It goes to the whole world. If you are friends with that person on social media, you might see it. \n\nThe school cannot ignore something that appears to be a threat. They have to take action to keep everyone safe. They can't just let it sit there in case something bad happens. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is real and what is just a joke. Some people might say things on the internet just to be funny. This happened at my school when someone overheard something and called the school. They looked at the person's Facebook and found some things that made them worry. \n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you can't control who sees them. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. \n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on social media. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't monitor private conversations, but if it's brought to their attention, they have to act. \n\nIt's the same thing if a teacher makes a fake account to friend students. They should not do that. I wouldn't friend my residents on social media because I don't want to see things that might get them in trouble.",
            "I think the war has lasted too long. \nThe original goal was good. We wanted to bring democracy to another country. \nBut now, I think we have lost sight of that goal. \nWe are not fighting for democracy anymore. \nWe are fighting just to show we are powerful. \nThis is not a good reason for war. \n\nThe war started with a good purpose. We wanted to give democracy to a country without a fair government. \nThat is a good reason for war. \nBut over time, our reasons have changed. \nWe are now fighting just to keep fighting. \nWe do not want to leave without winning. \n\nThe war has lasted for too long. \nIt is time for the country to take care of its own government. \nWe should stop the war and spend our money on our own problems. \nWe have many problems in our own country, like poverty and bad roads. \nWe should spend our money on these problems, not on war. \n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on war. \nWar should not be a long-term cost. \nWe should spend our money on things like health care and schools. \nNow, we are spending money to hurt our own soldiers in a war we are losing. \n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. It was stopped because someone found the information online. They looked at a site called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it's available for everyone to see. On Myspace, you have to be a member to see someone's profile. But if you accept someone as your \"friend,\" they can see your information. So, you give them permission.\n\nIt's hard to know who can see your information, but when you put it on the internet, many people can see it. In my case, I think it's good that someone found the information. It helped prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's not fair to have one person check everyone's profiles all the time, but then it's unfair to only look at the bad kids. If someone is looking for information to prevent something bad from happening, it's okay. But if they're just looking for trouble, it's not right.\n\nI don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook. I'm worried about people seeing things about me. There was a TV show about a man who got information easily. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger. It's not safe.\n\nPeople can learn a lot about you from your Facebook or Myspace. They can see your photos, your classes, and your friends. I tried to limit what I put up, but it's hard. I want to stay in touch with my friends.\n\nIt's a tricky issue because you never know who can see your information. My roommate told me about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right. How can school officials tell students what to do on the internet?",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It is a very complex issue. I feel like I am being hypocritical if I say certain things. I was against the war from the beginning, but now it's not as important as it used to be. Almost everyone agrees that it was a bad idea, except for the people in the administration.\n\nWe see this in polls from the United States, Iraq, and around the world. About 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks the war was a bad idea. 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US troops think it was a bad idea and that we should leave within a year.\n\nThe war was a disaster from the start. Now, leaving will also be difficult. The problem is that there is a big cultural difference between the US and the Middle East. We want to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not the right system for them. They might not want it.\n\nWe should think about the pros and cons before invading a country. We need to consider the problems that come with staying in Iraq. I don't agree with the administration's ideas for staying. I haven't heard a good reason to stay.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually, that's okay. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. I read that 80 percent of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter want us to leave now. If we ask them, they might know better than us.\n\nIf we leave and something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay, but they wanted us to leave. If we leave now, we can help them later as the good guys. We'll be better off than where we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the job you do. For example, women often have it harder because there's the idea of a \"glass ceiling\" where people may not want to work for a woman, even if she has the qualifications for a job. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In many workplaces, women are not often in top positions. It's hard for women to get jobs that they're qualified for because of this.\n\nIt's not just women who face this problem, though. Men can too. For example, in the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they like fashion. They may think, \"How can you know what fashion is if you're a man?\" This is because men who like fashion are often expected to have a certain style, and if they don't fit that style, people may doubt their ability to understand fashion.\n\nIt's the same with men who stay at home to be with their children. People may look down on them because they think men should be the main breadwinners. But some men may want to be with their children and take care of them. It's not a big deal if the wife has a better-paying job. \n\nSo, it's not just about gender. It's also about the kind of job you do and where you come from. For example, a person from a farm may not speak perfect English, but they may be very smart and able to run a company. However, other people may still judge them because of the way they speak.\n\nIt's hard to change these attitudes, but we're making progress. Women are becoming more accepted in business, and men are starting to stay at home to care for their children. This is good, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting equality and fairness so that everyone has a chance to succeed, no matter what their background is.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal. It was decriminalized. This means it is no longer a serious crime. Instead, people can be given a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and they do not have to be arrested and put in jail.\n\nIf someone is caught with marijuana and gets a ticket, this can affect their future. They may have trouble getting a job or in school. These problems do not go away just because marijuana is not a crime.\n\nHowever, some people say it is expensive to arrest and jail people. It costs money to take them to court and to pay for a lawyer. This can be a problem for cities that do not have a lot of money. In some cities, people do not want to make marijuana not a crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea to make marijuana not a crime. This can help the city have more money to spend on important things, like education and helping the homeless.\n\nBut there are also reasons why marijuana should not be everywhere. For example, it can be bad for driving and it is still not widely accepted in many places. If it were legal everywhere, it might seem strange to see people smoking it in public.\n\nI am not sure how I would feel if marijuana were completely legal. Some people might think it would be okay to sell it in stores like cigarettes. But this could also mean that more people would drive and smoke it, which could be a problem. Many people still think it is wrong to smoke marijuana in public.\n\nIn general, I think marijuana can have bad effects on people's lives, not just their ability to drive. But people react differently to different substances, and some people are better at controlling how they use them.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana should be treated. I do think that both marijuana and alcohol can have bad effects.",
            "I agree. \n\nWhy? \n\nMany of the Catholic Church's practices are traditional. They have done things in the same way for a long time. It is good to respect tradition. But it is also important to be able to change.\n\nSome Catholics believe they must go to church every week. They have strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are from different religions. My father is Episcopalian. My mother is Catholic. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my father's religion.\n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. We learn to love others in Catholic school. But it is hypocritical to say we love others and then not accept them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would solve the problem of child abuse. People who abuse children will probably continue to do so, even if they are married. This is because they are hurting a child, not a spouse.\n\nSo, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a good solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not thought about it deeply. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. \n\nThis is a very difficult topic. We must be careful not to offend people. \n\nThe idea of marriage is very important. But we also want to keep the church and government separate. It is hard to decide what marriage means without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nI think marriage should be a civil union. Many people get tax breaks and special treatment if they are married. But we should not look at the kind of marriage it is. We should just know that two people are together. \n\nThe idea of gay marriage is the same. Two people are together, and they should have the same rights. \n\nIf many states agree, they should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not right. The constitution should not be changed for one big issue. It is not important enough. \n\nWe should not change the constitution just to ban gay marriage. It is simple. \n\nNo.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with all of their choices. But I think they should have the same rights as others. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI believe that in democratic states, people usually support gay marriage. If you live in a state where they support it, you should respect their decision. You chose to live there, so you should accept their views.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as others. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal or not.\n\nI already answered this question. I don't think the president should make a decision for the whole country. I don't agree with President Bush's plan to ban gay marriage. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI think some things should be decided by individual states. The president will leave office soon. If a new president decides to change the law, it will just go back and forth. It's best to let each state decide for itself because they will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "The school system has the right to check student's Myspace pages. These pages are public, and students can post anything they want. School officials can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can still see it from their homes.\n\nSchools have a responsibility to keep students safe. If they check Myspace to find students who are breaking the rules, that's okay. It helps keep the school safe. I think that's good.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy. But if it helps keep students safe, I don't think that's a bad thing. It's like when schools have lockdowns to keep students safe from danger. They are just trying to keep the school a safe place.\n\nStudents should know that anything they post online can be seen by others. They can't control who sees it. If they post something bad, they might get in trouble. This is why some students are careful about what they post online.\n\nSchool officials are just trying to keep the school a safe place. They are not trying to be mean or hurt students. They just want to keep students safe from potential problems like school shootings.\n\nThis is why I think it's okay for school officials to check Myspace. They are just trying to help keep students safe.",
            "I am not sure about the war.  At first, I thought it was a good idea.  I was affected by 9/11.  I wanted to go and help.  But I think we made a mistake.  We did not think about the future.  We went without a plan.  And then things did not go well.\n\nI was for the war, but now I am against it.  I do not think it helped.  The people in the country we went to are fighting each other.  They cannot fight us if they are fighting themselves.  We went there because of 9/11.  But I do not care what happens to them now.\n\nSometimes I do not think they are human.  They fight a lot and cannot get along.  We did not know what to expect when we went there.  War is different for them than for us.  They are different in how they fight.  I do not think they want to make their country better.  They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly.  We were angry and wanted revenge.  We wanted to change their way of life.  But we did not think about the consequences.  We just went there and wanted to leave quickly.\n\nI think President Bush declared war on Iraq because people wanted to go to war.  He did not have a good plan.  We could not just let Iraq do bad things and then decide to rebuild.  But we could have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not have unity.  We did not know what we were doing.  That would have helped us.  We went to war with anger and emotion.  That is what we created in Iraq.\n\nI do not think we can change those people.  They will always be like that.  We cannot stay in Iraq forever.  Once we leave, things will collapse.  We are hurting ourselves by staying."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Catholic Church because it does not accept many things. The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. But these views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its thinking a little, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not permit abortion, so people who support abortion may not want to be a part of it. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you may not want to be in a group that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church should allow women to be priests and priests to be married. But this might not have stopped bad things from happening. It is hard to know for sure.\n\nPriests are said to be married to God. They are supposed to dedicate their lives to God. But other people work and have families, too. They have two lives. Priests should be able to have both.",
            "I am with gay marriage. I do not think it is right to tell people they can't get married because of their sex. \n\nI believe people are born with their sexual orientation. It's not a choice they make. We are all different. Some people are born straight, and some people are born gay. It's not something they can control.\n\nI think it's not fair to say that gay people made a wrong decision. They should not be punished for who they are. The federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security or morals. It's just about people being happy and being who they are.\n\nEveryone should have the right to get married. It's not fair to say no to people because of their sex. We should respect people's differences and not try to change them.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. There is no good reason not to. Many people think homosexuals threaten the traditional family. But that is not true. It is a different kind of relationship.\n\nGay couples are not the same as straight couples. But they are similar in many ways. They have the same kinds of relationships and the same goals.\n\nOne problem is that gay couples cannot get married in their community. They cannot be with their partner when they are sick or in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have been done on gay couples. They have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They are asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If the government allows them a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. We should be equal. Gay couples have the same problems as straight couples. They have the same kinds of relationships and the same issues.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children from gay couples are the same as children from straight couples. They need love and a home.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They go to those schools because they get bullied in public schools. This is not right.\n\nParents who are gay are the same as parents who are straight. They love their children and want the best for them.\n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. The law should be fair for everyone.\n\nBut President Bush has strong feelings about this. He believes it is against his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's beliefs. We should be fair to everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality problem. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to experts, not just what people think.\n\nWe should be fair and equal for everyone. Gay marriage should be allowed.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people think that just because a medicine is not allowed, it cannot be good. I do not agree. If a medicine is not allowed, it does not mean it has no good qualities. I think it should not be available for the public to use. But for medical use, I think it is okay.\n\nThere are many medicines that are not allowed, but we use them in pharmacies. They have good qualities. Oxycotton, Vicodin, and Perocets are examples. They are controlled substances, but we use them because they are helpful. I do not think marijuana should be treated differently just because there is a negative image around it.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you use marijuana a lot, it can be a problem. But so can alcohol. It is a difficult issue. I think we should allow marijuana, but we should not do it suddenly. We should add it to the list of allowed medicines gradually. This way, people will not use it too much.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as other medicines like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the bad image, people might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict now as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was a tradition for me.\n\nI went to a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends. Now, the church has made a shorter service for teenagers called a \"teenager mass.\" It lasts only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes. Even for morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. I do not know much about the church's politics. But I think this is how I see the church now.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think allowing them to marry or have women priests would have prevented pedophilia. There are married men who are still pedophiles. Their attraction to young children is not because they are allowed to marry or not marry. It is a person's choice to become a priest. Some religions allow priests to marry, like the Seventh Heaven church.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it is not their decision to choose. I do not think the church could have prevented these problems. If they knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was originally okay with the idea. But after the September 11th attacks, I think the US went to war in Iraq for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration made a big mistake by lying to the American people. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, said later that he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the United Nations. This is not good for a leader. It is wrong to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to limit its power since September 11th. I believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to take control of their oil.\n\nThe US has been in Iraq too long. If we leave now, there could be more fighting and more deaths. But I also do not think it is right to stay. The US is working with other countries in the region to bring order to Iraq. But I am not sure this will work. Iraq's government is weak, and there are many groups fighting for power.\n\nThe US used to be in charge, but now the Iraqi government has some control. But the parliament is not working well. The prime minister does not have much power. There are many groups fighting for control, and this is causing big problems.\n\nI do not have a clear answer to this problem. It is very complicated.",
            "I have thoughts about the War in Iraq. At first, I think it's pointless. The war was not declared by the U.S. Congress. I believe the reason we went to war was because Iraq was blamed for the September 11 attacks. But I do not think it's a big issue that I keep up with.\n\nI know that the U.S. is trying to build democracy in Iraq so it can be like the U.S. But this takes a long time. We also want to get oil from Iraq. However, staying there makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to try and create democracy, but this will take a long time.\n\nIf we leave, people in Iraq will be angry with us because we caused problems and now they have to start over. It's a hard decision.\n\nI think the war should continue, but it's not a real war because Congress did not declare it. We use guns to show we are a strong country. I think we should help Iraq, but it's also wasting our resources.\n\nIt's hard for me to say I want the war to end because I know families in the U.S. have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe. But if we stay in Iraq, we will try to change them into a second United States, and it will be hard for them.\n\nThe war is also making people hate the U.S. more. Iraq has a different culture than the U.S. If we try to change them, it will be worse for them. I think the war will go on for a long time.",

They do not think it is right. Only some people in certain areas agree.\n\nI do not think the government should make a law about the church. The constitution already says there should be separation of church and state. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Making a new law would be wrong and go against what is already written.\n\nI also think that if the government makes a law like this, it will be the only law that limits people's freedom, not the government's. This is not fair. The government should not try to control what people believe.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this law because of his own personal feelings as a Catholic. He wants to control what people believe. But this is not fair. It is up to the church, not the government, to decide what is right and wrong.\n\nThere is no good reason for this law. It will not help the economy. It might even make things better in society.

            "The war in Iraq \nI don't think the government was honest with the American people about why we went to war. \nThe government linked the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 attacks.

            "I support gay marriage. I have always believed in it. I think it is a personal preference. Many studies show that being gay may be a natural part of a person's biology, not something they choose. This makes it unfair to deny them equal rights. I think it is inhumane to treat people unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI do not think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice, not something for the government to decide. It is not just a state issue, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to. But they live like any other family: they walk their dogs and go about their daily lives.\n\nI think it is wrong for the government to try to decide what marriage means. It is like trying to play God. I do not think it is right to deny people their rights because of who they love.\n\nMany studies show that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. It is not something a person chooses, but something they are born with. For example, a person may be gay even if they grow up with sisters and no father. This shows that being gay is not a choice.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that it is a public issue. But if a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something for the government to decide.\n\nI do not think anyone should be denied the right to get married because of who they love. I support gay marriage.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes public. Everyone can see it. It is not private. As an R.A., I have dealt with this situation before. \n\nIf you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, someone might take it seriously. You should not put that kind of information on the internet. It goes to the whole world. If you are friends with that person on social media, you might see it. \n\nThe school cannot ignore something that appears to be a threat. They have to take action to keep everyone safe. They can't just let it sit there in case something bad happens. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is real and what is just a joke. Some people might say things on the internet just to be funny. This happened at my school when someone overheard something and called the school. They looked at the person's Facebook and found some things that made them worry. \n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you can't control who sees them. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. \n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on social media. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't monitor private conversations, but if it's brought to their attention, they have to act. \n\nIt's the same thing if a teacher makes a fake account to friend students.

            "I have a question. It was stopped because someone found the information online. They looked at a site called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it's available for everyone to see. On Myspace, you have to be a member to see someone's profile. But if you accept someone as your \"friend,\" they can see your information. So, you give them permission.\n\nIt's hard to know who can see your information, but when you put it on the internet, many people can see it. In my case, I think it's good that someone found the information. It helped prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's not fair to have one person check everyone's profiles all the time, but then it's unfair to only look at the bad kids. If someone is looking for information to prevent something bad from happening, it's okay. But if they're just looking for trouble, it's not right.\n\nI don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook.

About 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks the war was a bad idea. 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US troops think it was a bad idea and that we should leave within a year.\n\nThe war was a disaster from the start. Now, leaving will also be difficult. The problem is that there is a big cultural difference between the US and the Middle East. We want to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not the right system for them. They might not want it.\n\nWe should think about the pros and cons before invading a country. We need to consider the problems that come with staying in Iraq. I don't agree with the administration's ideas for staying. I haven't heard a good reason to stay.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually, that's okay. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. I read that 80 percent of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter want us to leave now. If we ask them, they might know better than us.\n\nIf we leave and something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay, but they wanted us to leave. If we leave now, we can help them later as the good guys. We'll be better off than where we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the job you do. For example, women often have it harder because there's the idea of a \"glass ceiling\" where people may not want to work for a woman, even if she has the qualifications for a job. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In many workplaces, women are not often in top positions. It's hard for women to get jobs that they're qualified for because of this.\n\nIt's not just women who face this problem, though. Men can too. For example, in the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they like fashion. They may think, \"How can you know what fashion is if you're a man?\" This is because men who like fashion are often expected to have a certain style, and if they don't fit that style, people may doubt their ability to understand fashion.\n\nIt's the same with men who stay at home to be with their children. People may look down on them because they think men should be the main breadwinners. But some men may want to be with their children and take care of them. It's not a big deal if the wife has a better-paying job. \n\nSo, it's not just about gender. It's also about the kind of job you do and where you come from. For example, a person from a farm may not speak perfect English, but they may be very smart and able to run a company. However, other people may still judge them because of the way they speak.\n\nIt's hard to change these attitudes, but we're making progress. Women are becoming more accepted in business, and men are starting to stay at home to care for their children. This is good, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting equality and fairness so that everyone has a chance to succeed, no matter what their background is.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal. It was decriminalized. This means it is no longer a serious crime. Instead, people can be given a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and they do not have to be arrested and put in jail.\n\nIf someone is caught with marijuana and gets a ticket, this can affect their future. They may have trouble getting a job or in school. These problems do not go away just because marijuana is not a crime.\n\nHowever, some people say it is expensive to arrest and jail people. It costs money to take them to court and to pay for a lawyer. This can be a problem for cities that do not have a lot of money. In some cities, people do not want to make marijuana not a crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea to make marijuana not a crime. This can help the city have more money to spend on important things, like education and helping the homeless.\n\nBut there are also reasons why marijuana should not be everywhere. For example, it can be bad for driving and it is still not widely accepted in many places. If it were legal everywhere, it might seem strange to see people smoking it in public.\n\nI am not sure how I would feel if marijuana were completely legal. Some people might think it would be okay to sell it in stores like cigarettes. But this could also mean that more people would drive and smoke it, which could be a problem. Many people still think it is wrong to smoke marijuana in public.\n\nIn general, I think marijuana can have bad effects on people's lives, not just their ability to drive. But people react differently to different substances, and some people are better at controlling how they use them.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana should be treated. I do think that both marijuana and alcohol can have bad effects.",
            "I agree. \n\nWhy? \n\nMany of the Catholic Church's practices are traditional. They have done things in the same way for a long time. It is good to respect tradition. But it is also important to be able to change.\n\nSome Catholics believe they must go to church every week. They have strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are from different religions. My father is Episcopalian. My mother is Catholic. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my father's religion.\n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. We learn to love others in Catholic school. But it is hypocritical to say we love others and then not accept them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would solve the problem of child abuse. People who abuse children will probably continue to do so, even if they are married. This is because they are hurting a child, not a spouse.\n\nSo, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a good solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not thought about it deeply. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. \n\nThis is a very difficult topic. We must be careful not to offend people. \n\nThe idea of marriage is very important. But we also want to keep the church and government separate. It is hard to decide what marriage means without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nI think marriage should be a civil union. Many people get tax breaks and special treatment if they are married. But we should not look at the kind of marriage it is. We should just know that two people are together. \n\nThe idea of gay marriage is the same. Two people are together, and they should have the same rights. \n\nIf many states agree, they should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not right. The constitution should not be changed for one big issue. It is not important enough. \n\nWe should not change the constitution just to ban gay marriage. It is simple. \n\nNo.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with all of their choices. But I think they should have the same rights as others. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI believe that in democratic states, people usually support gay marriage. If you live in a state where they support it, you should respect their decision. You chose to live there, so you should accept their views.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as others. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal or not.\n\nI already answered this question. I don't think the president should make a decision for the whole country. I don't agree with President Bush's plan to ban gay marriage. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI think some things should be decided by individual states. The president will leave office soon. If a new president decides to change the law, it will just go back and forth. It's best to let each state decide for itself because they will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "The school system has the right to check student's Myspace pages. These pages are public, and students can post anything they want. School officials can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can still see it from their homes.\n\nSchools have a responsibility to keep students safe. If they check Myspace to find students who are breaking the rules, that's okay. It helps keep the school safe. I think that's good.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy. But if it helps keep students safe, I don't think that's a bad thing. It's like when schools have lockdowns to keep students safe from danger. They are just trying to keep the school a safe place.\n\nStudents should know that anything they post online can be seen by others. They can't control who sees it. If they post something bad, they might get in trouble. This is why some students are careful about what they post online.\n\nSchool officials are just trying to keep the school a safe place. They are not trying to be mean or hurt students. They just want to keep students safe from potential problems like school shootings.\n\nThis is why I think it's okay for school officials to check Myspace. They are just trying to help keep students safe.",
            "I am not sure about the war.  At first, I thought it was a good idea.  I was affected by 9/11.  I wanted to go and help.  But I think we made a mistake.  We did not think about the future.  We went without a plan.  And then things did not go well.\n\nI was for the war, but now I am against it.  I do not think it helped.  The people in the country we went to are fighting each other.  They cannot fight us if they are fighting themselves.  We went there because of 9/11.  But I do not care what happens to them now.\n\nSometimes I do not think they are human.  They fight a lot and cannot get along.  We did not know what to expect when we went there.  War is different for them than for us.  They are different in how they fight.  I do not think they want to make their country better.  They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly.  We were angry and wanted revenge.  We wanted to change their way of life.  But we did not think about the consequences.  We just went there and wanted to leave quickly.\n\nI think President Bush declared war on Iraq because people wanted to go to war.  He did not have a good plan.  We could not just let Iraq do bad things and then decide to rebuild.  But we could have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not have unity.  We did not know what we were doing.  That would have helped us.  We went to war with anger and emotion.  That is what we created in Iraq.\n\nI do not think we can change those people.  They will always be like that.  We cannot stay in Iraq forever.  Once we leave, things will collapse.  We are hurting ourselves by staying."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Catholic Church because it does not accept many things. The Church has strong views on issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. But these views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its thinking a little, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They think the Church is wrong. The Church does not permit abortion, so people who support abortion may not want to be a part of it. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in gay marriage, you may not want to be in a group that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church should allow women to be priests and priests to be married. But this might not have stopped bad things from happening. It is hard to know for sure.\n\nPriests are said to be married to God. They are supposed to dedicate their lives to God. But other people work and have families, too. They have two lives. Priests should be able to have both.",
            "I am with gay marriage. I do not think it is right to tell people they can't get married because of their sex. \n\nI believe people are born with their sexual orientation. It's not a choice they make. We are all different. Some people are born straight, and some people are born gay. It's not something they can control.\n\nI think it's not fair to say that gay people made a wrong decision. They should not be punished for who they are. The federal government should not get involved in this issue. It's not a matter of national security or morals. It's just about people being happy and being who they are.\n\nEveryone should have the right to get married. It's not fair to say no to people because of their sex. We should respect people's differences and not try to change them.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. There is no good reason not to. Many people think homosexuals threaten the traditional family. But that is not true. It is a different kind of relationship.\n\nGay couples are not the same as straight couples. But they are similar in many ways. They have the same kinds of relationships and the same goals.\n\nOne problem is that gay couples cannot get married in their community. They cannot be with their partner when they are sick or in the hospital. This is not fair. They should be able to have the same rights as everyone else.\n\nMany studies have been done on gay couples. They have the same success rates as straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They are asking for a marriage certificate from the government. If the government allows them a civil union, why not a marriage?\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. We should be equal. Gay couples have the same problems as straight couples. They have the same kinds of relationships and the same issues.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and children. But children from gay couples are the same as children from straight couples. They need love and a home.\n\nIn New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents. They go to those schools because they get bullied in public schools. This is not right.\n\nParents who are gay are the same as parents who are straight. They love their children and want the best for them.\n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. The law should be fair for everyone.\n\nBut President Bush has strong feelings about this. He believes it is against his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's beliefs. We should be fair to everyone.\n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality problem. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to experts, not just what people think.\n\nWe should be fair and equal for everyone. Gay marriage should be allowed.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. Many people think that just because a medicine is not allowed, it cannot be good. I do not agree. If a medicine is not allowed, it does not mean it has no good qualities. I think it should not be available for the public to use. But for medical use, I think it is okay.\n\nThere are many medicines that are not allowed, but we use them in pharmacies. They have good qualities. Oxycotton, Vicodin, and Perocets are examples. They are controlled substances, but we use them because they are helpful. I do not think marijuana should be treated differently just because there is a negative image around it.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you use marijuana a lot, it can be a problem. But so can alcohol. It is a difficult issue. I think we should allow marijuana, but we should not do it suddenly. We should add it to the list of allowed medicines gradually. This way, people will not use it too much.\n\nPeople have a bad image of marijuana because it is not allowed. But it is not as bad as other medicines like heroin or cocaine. If we remove the bad image, people might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict now as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was a tradition for me.\n\nI went to a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends. Now, the church has made a shorter service for teenagers called a \"teenager mass.\" It lasts only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes. Even for morning masses, where I used to dress up, people now wear jeans and khakis.\n\nI think the biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. I do not know much about the church's politics. But I think this is how I see the church now.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests, I do not think allowing them to marry or have women priests would have prevented pedophilia. There are married men who are still pedophiles. Their attraction to young children is not because they are allowed to marry or not marry. It is a person's choice to become a priest. Some religions allow priests to marry, like the Seventh Heaven church.\n\nI think people are born with their sexuality, and it is not their decision to choose. I do not think the church could have prevented these problems. If they knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew about everything.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was originally okay with the idea. But after the September 11th attacks, I think the US went to war in Iraq for the wrong reasons. The Bush administration linked the war to Osama Bin Laden and Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration made a big mistake by lying to the American people. Colin Powell, the former secretary of state, said later that he was not sure about the evidence when he talked to the United Nations. This is not good for a leader. It is wrong to lie to the people.\n\nI think the Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution. They have tried to limit its power since September 11th. I believe the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq. He wanted to take control of their oil.\n\nThe US has been in Iraq too long. If we leave now, there could be more fighting and more deaths. But I also do not think it is right to stay. The US is working with other countries in the region to bring order to Iraq. But I am not sure this will work. Iraq's government is weak, and there are many groups fighting for power.\n\nThe US used to be in charge, but now the Iraqi government has some control. But the parliament is not working well. The prime minister does not have much power. There are many groups fighting for control, and this is causing big problems.\n\nI do not have a clear answer to this problem. It is very complicated.",
            "I have thoughts about the War in Iraq. At first, I think it's pointless. The war was not declared by the U.S. Congress. I believe the reason we went to war was because Iraq was blamed for the September 11 attacks. But I do not think it's a big issue that I keep up with.\n\nI know that the U.S. is trying to build democracy in Iraq so it can be like the U.S. But this takes a long time. We also want to get oil from Iraq. However, staying there makes people unhappy. If we stay, we have to try and create democracy, but this will take a long time.\n\nIf we leave, people in Iraq will be angry with us because we caused problems and now they have to start over. It's a hard decision.\n\nI think the war should continue, but it's not a real war because Congress did not declare it. We use guns to show we are a strong country. I think we should help Iraq, but it's also wasting our resources.\n\nIt's hard for me to say I want the war to end because I know families in the U.S. have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want them to be safe. But if we stay in Iraq, we will try to change them into a second United States, and it will be hard for them.\n\nThe war is also making people hate the U.S. more. Iraq has a different culture than the U.S. If we try to change them, it will be worse for them. I think the war will go on for a long time.",

They do not think it is right. Only some people in certain areas agree.\n\nI do not think the government should make a law about the church. The constitution already says there should be separation of church and state. This allows for religious freedom in the United States. Making a new law would be wrong and go against what is already written.\n\nI also think that if the government makes a law like this, it will be the only law that limits people's freedom, not the government's. This is not fair. The government should not try to control what people believe.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this law because of his own personal feelings as a Catholic. He wants to control what people believe. But this is not fair. It is up to the church, not the government, to decide what is right and wrong.\n\nThere is no good reason for this law. It will not help the economy. It might even make things better in society.

            "The war in Iraq \nI don't think the government was honest with the American people about why we went to war. \nThe government linked the invasion of Iraq to the 9/11 attacks.

            "I support gay marriage. I have always believed in it. I think it is a personal preference. Many studies show that being gay may be a natural part of a person's biology, not something they choose. This makes it unfair to deny them equal rights. I think it is inhumane to treat people unfairly because of something they cannot control.\n\nI do not think the government should decide who can get married. Marriage is a personal choice, not something for the government to decide. It is not just a state issue, but a personal issue. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed to. But they live like any other family: they walk their dogs and go about their daily lives.\n\nI think it is wrong for the government to try to decide what marriage means. It is like trying to play God. I do not think it is right to deny people their rights because of who they love.\n\nMany studies show that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. It is not something a person chooses, but something they are born with. For example, a person may be gay even if they grow up with sisters and no father. This shows that being gay is not a choice.\n\nThe only reason I can think of for not allowing gay marriage is that it is a public issue. But if a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately. But if two gay people want to get married, it becomes a public issue. I think marriage should be a private matter, not something for the government to decide.\n\nI do not think anyone should be denied the right to get married because of who they love. I support gay marriage.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes public. Everyone can see it. It is not private. As an R.A., I have dealt with this situation before. \n\nIf you put something on the internet, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, someone might take it seriously. You should not put that kind of information on the internet. It goes to the whole world. If you are friends with that person on social media, you might see it. \n\nThe school cannot ignore something that appears to be a threat. They have to take action to keep everyone safe. They can't just let it sit there in case something bad happens. \n\nBut it is hard to know what is real and what is just a joke. Some people might say things on the internet just to be funny. This happened at my school when someone overheard something and called the school. They looked at the person's Facebook and found some things that made them worry. \n\nWhen you put things on the internet, you can't control who sees them. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it online. You can't tell people what to think or take seriously. \n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on social media. But if something is brought to their attention, they have to take it seriously. They can't monitor private conversations, but if it's brought to their attention, they have to act. \n\nIt's the same thing if a teacher makes a fake account to friend students.

            "I have a question. It was stopped because someone found the information online. They looked at a site called Myspace. If you put information on the internet, it's available for everyone to see. On Myspace, you have to be a member to see someone's profile. But if you accept someone as your \"friend,\" they can see your information. So, you give them permission.\n\nIt's hard to know who can see your information, but when you put it on the internet, many people can see it. In my case, I think it's good that someone found the information. It helped prevent a life from being lost.\n\nIt's not fair to have one person check everyone's profiles all the time, but then it's unfair to only look at the bad kids. If someone is looking for information to prevent something bad from happening, it's okay. But if they're just looking for trouble, it's not right.\n\nI don't have a Myspace, but I have a Facebook.

About 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks the war was a bad idea. 80 percent of Iraqi people and 70 percent of US troops think it was a bad idea and that we should leave within a year.\n\nThe war was a disaster from the start. Now, leaving will also be difficult. The problem is that there is a big cultural difference between the US and the Middle East. We want to bring democracy to Iraq, but it's not the right system for them. They might not want it.\n\nWe should think about the pros and cons before invading a country. We need to consider the problems that come with staying in Iraq. I don't agree with the administration's ideas for staying. I haven't heard a good reason to stay.\n\nIf we want to leave gradually, that's okay. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. I read that 80 percent of Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and a quarter want us to leave now. If we ask them, they might know better than us.\n\nIf we leave and something goes wrong, we can say we were going to stay, but they wanted us to leave. If we leave now, we can help them later as the good guys. We'll be better off than where we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States. It's not just about women, though. I think it also depends on the job you do. For example, women often have it harder because there's the idea of a \"glass ceiling\" where people may not want to work for a woman, even if she has the qualifications for a job. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In many workplaces, women are not often in top positions. It's hard for women to get jobs that they're qualified for because of this.\n\nIt's not just women who face this problem, though. Men can too. For example, in the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they like fashion. They may think, \"How can you know what fashion is if you're a man?\" This is because men who like fashion are often expected to have a certain style, and if they don't fit that style, people may doubt their ability to understand fashion.\n\nIt's the same with men who stay at home to be with their children. People may look down on them because they think men should be the main breadwinners. But some men may want to be with their children and take care of them. It's not a big deal if the wife has a better-paying job. \n\nSo, it's not just about gender. It's also about the kind of job you do and where you come from. For example, a person from a farm may not speak perfect English, but they may be very smart and able to run a company. However, other people may still judge them because of the way they speak.\n\nIt's hard to change these attitudes, but we're making progress. Women are becoming more accepted in business, and men are starting to stay at home to care for their children. This is good, but it's a slow process. We need to keep promoting equality and fairness so that everyone has a chance to succeed, no matter what their background is.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana was not made legal. It was decriminalized. This means it is no longer a serious crime. Instead, people can be given a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and they do not have to be arrested and put in jail.\n\nIf someone is caught with marijuana and gets a ticket, this can affect their future. They may have trouble getting a job or in school. These problems do not go away just because marijuana is not a crime.\n\nHowever, some people say it is expensive to arrest and jail people. It costs money to take them to court and to pay for a lawyer. This can be a problem for cities that do not have a lot of money. In some cities, people do not want to make marijuana not a crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea to make marijuana not a crime. This can help the city have more money to spend on important things, like education and helping the homeless.\n\nBut there are also reasons why marijuana should not be everywhere. For example, it can be bad for driving and it is still not widely accepted in many places. If it were legal everywhere, it might seem strange to see people smoking it in public.\n\nI am not sure how I would feel if marijuana were completely legal. Some people might think it would be okay to sell it in stores like cigarettes. But this could also mean that more people would drive and smoke it, which could be a problem. Many people still think it is wrong to smoke marijuana in public.\n\nIn general, I think marijuana can have bad effects on people's lives, not just their ability to drive. But people react differently to different substances, and some people are better at controlling how they use them.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana should be treated. I do think that both marijuana and alcohol can have bad effects.",
            "I agree. \n\nWhy? \n\nMany of the Catholic Church's practices are traditional. They have done things in the same way for a long time. It is good to respect tradition. But it is also important to be able to change.\n\nSome Catholics believe they must go to church every week. They have strict rules about how things are done. Sometimes, I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents are from different religions. My father is Episcopalian. My mother is Catholic. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my father's religion.\n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. We learn to love others in Catholic school. But it is hypocritical to say we love others and then not accept them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would solve the problem of child abuse. People who abuse children will probably continue to do so, even if they are married. This is because they are hurting a child, not a spouse.\n\nSo, I do not think allowing priests to marry would be a good solution.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not thought about it deeply. I do not know if one side is right or wrong. \n\nThis is a very difficult topic. We must be careful not to offend people. \n\nThe idea of marriage is very important. But we also want to keep the church and government separate. It is hard to decide what marriage means without hurting anyone's feelings. \n\nI think marriage should be a civil union. Many people get tax breaks and special treatment if they are married. But we should not look at the kind of marriage it is. We should just know that two people are together. \n\nThe idea of gay marriage is the same. Two people are together, and they should have the same rights. \n\nIf many states agree, they should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not right. The constitution should not be changed for one big issue. It is not important enough. \n\nWe should not change the constitution just to ban gay marriage. It is simple. \n\nNo.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with all of their choices. But I think they should have the same rights as others. I don't think the president should decide for the whole country. Each state should decide for itself.\n\nI believe that in democratic states, people usually support gay marriage. If you live in a state where they support it, you should respect their decision. You chose to live there, so you should accept their views.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same opportunities as others. So, each state should decide whether to make gay marriage legal or not.\n\nI already answered this question. I don't think the president should make a decision for the whole country. I don't agree with President Bush's plan to ban gay marriage. He should not decide how each state should be run.\n\nI think some things should be decided by individual states. The president will leave office soon. If a new president decides to change the law, it will just go back and forth. It's best to let each state decide for itself because they will live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I don't think so.",
            "The school system has the right to check student's Myspace pages. These pages are public, and students can post anything they want. School officials can see what students post, even if it's not under the school's name. They can still see it from their homes.\n\nSchools have a responsibility to keep students safe. If they check Myspace to find students who are breaking the rules, that's okay. It helps keep the school safe. I think that's good.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy. But if it helps keep students safe, I don't think that's a bad thing. It's like when schools have lockdowns to keep students safe from danger. They are just trying to keep the school a safe place.\n\nStudents should know that anything they post online can be seen by others. They can't control who sees it. If they post something bad, they might get in trouble. This is why some students are careful about what they post online.\n\nSchool officials are just trying to keep the school a safe place. They are not trying to be mean or hurt students. They just want to keep students safe from potential problems like school shootings.\n\nThis is why I think it's okay for school officials to check Myspace. They are just trying to help keep students safe.",
            "I am not sure about the war.  At first, I thought it was a good idea.  I was affected by 9/11.  I wanted to go and help.  But I think we made a mistake.  We did not think about the future.  We went without a plan.  And then things did not go well.\n\nI was for the war, but now I am against it.  I do not think it helped.  The people in the country we went to are fighting each other.  They cannot fight us if they are fighting themselves.  We went there because of 9/11.  But I do not care what happens to them now.\n\nSometimes I do not think they are human.  They fight a lot and cannot get along.  We did not know what to expect when we went there.  War is different for them than for us.  They are different in how they fight.  I do not think they want to make their country better.  They just want us to leave.\n\nI think we were not thinking clearly.  We were angry and wanted revenge.  We wanted to change their way of life.  But we did not think about the consequences.  We just went there and wanted to leave quickly.\n\nI think President Bush declared war on Iraq because people wanted to go to war.  He did not have a good plan.  We could not just let Iraq do bad things and then decide to rebuild.  But we could have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not have unity.  We did not know what we were doing.  That would have helped us.  We went to war with anger and emotion.  That is what we created in Iraq.\n\nI do not think we can change those people.  They will always be like that.  We cannot stay in Iraq forever.  Once we leave, things will collapse.  We are hurting ourselves by staying."
