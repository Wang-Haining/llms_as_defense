            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Many people think the Church is losing followers because it is not accepting of some things. This is true of issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they may be a bit old-fashioned. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it might keep more followers. \n\nMany people are turning against the Church because of its views on these issues. They do not agree with the Church's ideas. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so people who support abortion might not want to be part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in something and want to do it, but the Church does not agree, you might not want to be part of it.\n\nI also do not see why priests cannot be married or have women priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but I do not see why they cannot have both a job and a family. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family. Priests should be able to have both too. \n\nMaking these changes could help the Church keep its followers.",

They should not be blamed for how they are.\n\nIt seems that people are born gay or straight. I was born straight. I do not think it is fair to blame someone for being gay.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can marry whom. It is not a government issue. It is a personal issue.\n\nI do not think it is right to judge people. The federal government should not be involved in people's personal lives.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. Here's why: \n\nThere's no good reason to stop it. Many people think gay couples harm the traditional family, but that's not true. They are different. There are many reasons to support it. It's like two different sides of the same coin. You can't have heads without tails. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples in many areas, like taxes and healthcare. If you're gay, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you. That's not fair. Many studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same level of happiness and success in their relationships.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church, but about getting a marriage certificate from the government. If the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It's not fair to say some people can have a marriage and others can't. That's like segregation.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their communities. They also worry about children of gay couples. But these are not good reasons. Children of gay parents can be happy and healthy just like children of straight parents. We need to treat all people equally.\n\nThe government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment against it is not fair. President Bush has strong views against gay marriage, but they are based on his religion. Morality is different for everyone. We shouldn't ignore the feelings and opinions of other groups in America.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are mentally ill or damaged. But that's not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I think some illegal drugs have good qualities. I do not think they should be available to the public. But I think they can be used for medical purposes.\n\nThere are many drugs that are illegal, but pharmacies use them. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. They are controlled substances. We use them because they are helpful. If we do not allow marijuana to be helpful because it is illegal, that makes no sense.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, that can also cause big problems. It is a difficult issue.\n\nI think we should make marijuana available gradually, not all at once. This way, people will not misuse it. First, we should remove the bad image that people have of marijuana. Many people think it is bad, but it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.\n\nIf people do not think marijuana is bad, they may use it responsibly. And it can be helpful for medical reasons.",
            "The church has changed over the years to be more like the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I always went to church on Sundays. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes and a purse. I went to a private school, and my friends and I would attend church together. But now, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter church service, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, even during summer. Some people wear beach clothes, and families arrive late. Even at early morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThese changes are the biggest things I have noticed. I do not know about the church's politics, but these are the things that I see. \n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I do not think that changing the church rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, could have prevented these problems. There are married men who have this problem. It is not because they are allowed to get married or not. Being a priest is a choice, and it is a choice that some people make. In some religions, priests can get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith. If someone wants to get married and practice their faith, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with this problem, not because of how they are raised. It is not something that can be changed. The church could not have prevented this problem, unless they knew about it and chose to cover it up. In that case, that would be wrong.",

The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden.

Colin Powell, who was a high government official, now says he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nThis is a serious problem. It is against the law for a government official to lie to the people. I think the Bush administration does not respect the law and the Constitution.\n\nThe administration wanted to go to war. They had a plan to go to war. They wanted to control Iraq's oil. This is not a good reason to go to war.\n\nThe war has lasted too long. If we leave now, the country might fall apart. Many people might die. The United Nations and the United States are trying to find a solution. They want a group of countries from the area to help restore order in Iraq.\n\nBut this is not a good idea. The country's leaders are not working well together. The government is not effective.

            "I do not think it is right for a state to make something legal or illegal based on church rules. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control church decisions.\n\nIn the Constitution, it is written that church and state are separate. I think trying to make a law about this would be against what is already written. If the government tries to make a law, it would be like choosing one church's rules over another. Many Catholics and Christians do not support this.\n\nIt's not up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot say is right or wrong. The separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom in the United States.\n\nIf the government tries to make a law about this, it would be bad. It would be against what is already written in the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few laws that helps the government control people instead of helping keep them free.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. The President wants to change the law because he personally does not agree with it. This is not fair because it shows he likes one church over all others.\n\nThe churches should decide if something is right or wrong, not the government. There is no good reason for the President to try to change the law. It is just his personal view. I do not see how it would help the country or the economy. In fact, it might even help society more if it were left alone.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult issue. I don't think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war in general, especially when it involves a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government made the same mistakes in both wars.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in Iraq. The government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the consequences. The US government tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, but it was a difficult task. Democracy takes time to develop, and the US government did not do enough to prepare for the aftermath.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would not be easy. They should have planned for all possible outcomes. The government was not prepared for the void of power in Iraq and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. They should have considered the long-term effects of the war and the number of American casualties. The US government's main reason for invading Iraq was to control the country's oil resources.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and Iraq has peace soon. However, this may not happen.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always believed in it. I think it's a personal preference, and it's not something people should be judged for. Many scientists now think that being gay may be partly because of biology, not because of the way we're raised. I think it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nGovernments should not decide who can get married. It's a personal choice, not a government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live like any other family. They walk their dogs and take care of their homes just like everyone else. I think it's wrong for politicians to decide who can and can't get married.\n\nSome scientists say that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. People may be born that way, like some may be right-handed or left-handed. It's not because of how they were raised or what they learned.\n\nThe main problem is that gay people can't get married without being in the news. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big public issue. I think marriage should be a personal matter, not something that's decided by the government.\n\nI am against the government telling people who they can and can't marry. It's a private matter, and people should be free to make their own choices.",

If you put something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or bad things, people might say something. You can't control what others say.\n\nThe internet is public. If your friends see it on MySpace, they will get a bulletin. The school cannot ignore this. They must take it seriously. They can't just let it sit there, or something bad might happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nYou don't know what to believe because some people just joke around. But some things can be very serious. In our school situation, someone overheard a student talking and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that could be serious.\n\nWhen you post things on the internet, your privacy is not safe. If you don't want something out there, don't put it there. You can't control what others think of you. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. But if a student brings it to their attention, they must take it seriously. If there is danger, they have to act.\n\nSchool officials should not monitor students' phone conversations, texts, or internet chats. But if a student tells them about something, it's different.

But over time, I do not think this is the main reason we are still fighting. \n\nSome people might say our original goal was good, but I think our motives were not clear from the beginning. There were problems with the leader of the country, Saddam Hussein, and the U.S. president's father had disagreements with him. \n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy, that would have been a good reason for war.

We can't have one person watching all the students' profiles to prevent bad things from happening.  This would be unfair.  We can't have someone's job be to watch what students are doing on the internet.\n\nI have a Facebook account.  I don't like that anyone can see things about me on the internet.  I know there are people who want to hurt others.  They can get information about you from your profile.  They can find out what you look like, where you go to school, and who your friends are.  They can even find out your schedule and where you are during the day.\n\nI try not to put too much information on my Facebook account.  But I also want to be able to talk to my friends.  So, it's a problem.\n\nI heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace accounts.  I don't think the school had the right to do that.  I don't know how they could tell students what to do on the internet.",
            "I am here to talk about the Iraq War. I wish I didn't have to say this. I was against it from the start. But now, people are saying it's not important anymore. I agree. Most people worldwide think it was a bad idea. Even many Americans serving in the military think we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we went there. Now it's worse. There is no easy way to fix the Middle East. The United States and the Middle East have very different cultures. We cannot just bring democracy to a place where people do not want it.\n\nWe invaded Iraq because Saddam Hussein was a bad leader. But we must consider the consequences. We have to weigh the good and the bad before making important decisions.\n\nI do not think we should stay in Iraq any longer. I have not heard a good reason to stay. If we leave slowly, it may be okay. But I do not see a reason to stay at all.\n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. They think we should be gone within a year. These are the people we are trying to help. Maybe they know better than us. If we ask them what to do, they tell us to leave. Then if things get worse, we can say we tried to help, but they made the decision to leave.\n\nWe will never be the good guys in the Middle East, but we can try to do better. I wish we were not in this situation.",
            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. This issue affects both men and women, depending on the work they do. Women often face difficulties in the workplace because of a concept called the \"glass ceiling.\" Even with equal qualifications, women may not get promoted because of a long history of men holding positions of power. This is because of how society has been taught to think.\n\nMen also face problems, especially in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. In these areas, men are often looked down upon because society expects them to work and make money. Stay-at-home dads often struggle because people think it's not normal for men to be at home caring for children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people may not take men seriously, especially if they are straight. This is because men who like fashion often have different lifestyles than others. If a man is in fashion, people may wonder if he really understands fashion for women.\n\nI believe that changing society's mindset about gender equality is hard. We have made progress, but it is slow. We are making progress as more women become CEOs and get accepted in business. Men are also becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to understand that it's okay.\n\nTo change, we need to promote people who are different from what society expects. We should show the good qualities of these people without being pushy. If we try too hard, people will resist. I think we are at a good point right now where people are starting to understand and accept differences.\n\nPeople from different places or with different backgrounds can also be discriminated against. For example, someone from a farm who wants to become a CEO may be looked down upon because of their grammar. This can happen between genders and within genders.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many problems with gender equality in the United States. Changing society takes time, and we are making progress slowly. We need to continue promoting equality and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it a less serious crime. \nIt is no longer a crime that can result in arrest and jailtime. \nNow it is like getting a traffic ticket. \nYou get a fine and it does not affect your future in a big way. \nHowever, some people worry about the future effects of a marijuana charge. \nEven if it is no longer a crime, it can still be a problem. \nBut some cities are saying that arresting people for marijuana is expensive. \nIt costs money to arrest, try, and jail people. \nSo, some cities are deciding not to make it a crime. \nIn Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay to make marijuana legal. \nThis can help the city make more money to spend on important things like schools and programs to help the elderly and the homeless. \nHowever, some people think that if marijuana were completely legal, it would be a problem. \nMore people might smoke it and drive, which is not safe. \nAlso, some people still think it is not right to smoke marijuana. \nIt is still not acceptable in many places. \nI do not know what to think. \nI think that alcohol can have more serious effects on people. \nBut marijuana can still be a problem for some people. \nEveryone reacts differently to substances. \nSome people can use them in a safe way, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say what the effects will be. \nI think that both marijuana and alcohol can have serious effects.",
            "I would say yes. \n\nHere's why. Many things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It is good to respect tradition. But it is also important to be open to change.\n\nSome Catholics think they have to go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes, the Catholic Church judges people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was also an Episcopalian. My mom was Catholic. But they could not marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching. But it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think some parts of Catholic teaching tell you what to do. But the way the Church acts is not always like this. It is too old-fashioned. But the Church still follows it.\n\nI do not think this would make a difference. I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. But I do not think this would stop them from behaving badly with children. It is a different situation.\n\nPeople who do bad things with children will probably do it anyway. It is not about being married or not. So, I do not think allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not thought about it deeply. I do not think either side is right or wrong. But I know this is a very difficult topic. It is hard because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are closely connected.\n\nI think a civil union is a good idea. It means that two people are together. They should not have to tell the government about their church or God. The government should only care about the fact that they are together.\n\nI also think about same-sex marriage. If two people love each other, they should be able to get a civil union. It does not matter if they are gay or not.\n\nIf all the states can come to an agreement, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough. We should not change the constitution for this reason.\n\nI do not think this issue is serious enough to change the constitution. We should just leave it alone.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. Homosexuality is a complex issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I do not think you should disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there, so I think you should respect the state's decision.\n\nI already said this, but I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. He cannot decide how every state should be. He lives in one state, but he is not in charge of all states. He will be out of office soon. If a democratic president is elected, they may lift the ban. It would just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think we should have a national law requiring all states to allow gay marriage. Each state should be free to make its own decision.",
            "I don't think it's a problem for the school officials to see a student's Myspace page.  Myspace is a public place where people can post things for others to see. If you post something there, it's like saying it out loud in a public place.  School officials can see it, but it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nIf they go on the internet to look for student behavior, that's to make the school a safer place. They might look for things like drinking or smoking. But I think it's okay if they do this to save lives. It's like a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nSchools can see what students are doing, even if it's not on the school's website. They can see it from home. So, it's not like an invasion of privacy. If they save lives or make the school a better place, I think it's okay.\n\nMany schools have rules and do things to keep students safe. They practice lock downs and drills in case of emergencies, like terrorist attacks. This is like what the school officials did in this case. They wanted to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nI think it's not a problem for school officials to see a student's Myspace page. They can see it if they want to. It's not an invasion of privacy. They are trying to make the school a safer place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by the 9/11 attack. I wanted to do something to help. But I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We went to war without a clear plan. I believe this led to problems for us. I now oppose the war. I do not think it helped. As long as the people in that country fight with each other, they cannot fight with us. I do not think our presence there helped.\n\nI stopped caring about the situation there because of the 9/11 attack. I do not think they are human. They fight with each other and cannot work together. I do not care what happens to them.\n\nWe went to war without being prepared. We did not know what to expect. War is different for them than for us. They are savage in war. I do not think they want to improve their country. I think they want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war for revenge. I do not think we thought about the consequences. President Bush wanted to go to war. Many people wanted to go to war because of 9/11. I understand why he made the decision. But I think we could have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not have a clear goal. We did not know what to do to create order. There was no unity among the people in charge. I think this made things worse. We created problems in that country because of our emotions. I do not think we can change the people there. I think they will always be the same.\n\nI do not think we are making progress. We made some progress, but it is not enough. I think the country will collapse when we leave. We cannot stay there forever. I think we are hurting ourselves by staying in that country."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Many people think the Church is losing followers because it is not accepting of some things. This is true of issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they may be a bit old-fashioned. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it might keep more followers. \n\nMany people are turning against the Church because of its views on these issues. They do not agree with the Church's ideas. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so people who support abortion might not want to be part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in something and want to do it, but the Church does not agree, you might not want to be part of it.\n\nI also do not see why priests cannot be married or have women priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but I do not see why they cannot have both a job and a family. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family. Priests should be able to have both too. \n\nMaking these changes could help the Church keep its followers.",
            "I do not oppose gay marriage. I think people are born who they are. Some people are gay. I do not think it is a choice. They should not be blamed for how they are.\n\nIt seems that people are born gay or straight. I was born straight. I do not think it is fair to blame someone for being gay.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can marry whom. It is not a government issue. It is a personal issue.\n\nI do not think it is right to judge people. The federal government should not be involved in people's personal lives. They should be free to live as they are.\n\nPeople should not be punished for being gay. They are who they are, and that is not a choice.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. Here's why: \n\nThere's no good reason to stop it. Many people think gay couples harm the traditional family, but that's not true. They are different. There are many reasons to support it. It's like two different sides of the same coin. You can't have heads without tails. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples in many areas, like taxes and healthcare. If you're gay, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you. That's not fair. Many studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same level of happiness and success in their relationships.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church, but about getting a marriage certificate from the government. If the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It's not fair to say some people can have a marriage and others can't. That's like segregation.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their communities. They also worry about children of gay couples. But these are not good reasons. Children of gay parents can be happy and healthy just like children of straight parents. We need to treat all people equally.\n\nThe government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment against it is not fair. President Bush has strong views against gay marriage, but they are based on his religion. Morality is different for everyone. We shouldn't ignore the feelings and opinions of other groups in America.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are mentally ill or damaged. But that's not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I think some illegal drugs have good qualities. I do not think they should be available to the public. But I think they can be used for medical purposes.\n\nThere are many drugs that are illegal, but pharmacies use them. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. They are controlled substances. We use them because they are helpful. If we do not allow marijuana to be helpful because it is illegal, that makes no sense.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, that can also cause big problems. It is a difficult issue.\n\nI think we should make marijuana available gradually, not all at once. This way, people will not misuse it. First, we should remove the bad image that people have of marijuana. Many people think it is bad, but it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.\n\nIf people do not think marijuana is bad, they may use it responsibly. And it can be helpful for medical reasons.",
            "The church has changed over the years to be more like the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I always went to church on Sundays. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes and a purse. I went to a private school, and my friends and I would attend church together. But now, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter church service, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, even during summer. Some people wear beach clothes, and families arrive late. Even at early morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThese changes are the biggest things I have noticed. I do not know about the church's politics, but these are the things that I see. \n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I do not think that changing the church rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, could have prevented these problems. There are married men who have this problem. It is not because they are allowed to get married or not. Being a priest is a choice, and it is a choice that some people make. In some religions, priests can get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith. If someone wants to get married and practice their faith, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with this problem, not because of how they are raised. It is not something that can be changed. The church could not have prevented this problem, unless they knew about it and chose to cover it up. In that case, that would be wrong.",
            "I have a problem with the war in Iraq.  The reason we went to war is still not clear.  People were still hurting from the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Colin Powell, who was a high government official, now says he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nThis is a serious problem. It is against the law for a government official to lie to the people. I think the Bush administration does not respect the law and the Constitution.\n\nThe administration wanted to go to war. They had a plan to go to war. They wanted to control Iraq's oil. This is not a good reason to go to war.\n\nThe war has lasted too long. If we leave now, the country might fall apart. Many people might die. The United Nations and the United States are trying to find a solution. They want a group of countries from the area to help restore order in Iraq.\n\nBut this is not a good idea. The country's leaders are not working well together. The government is not effective. People are fighting for control. This is not a good situation.\n\nI do not know what to think. I do not have a simple answer to this problem.",

But this is not a good reason to stay.\n\nIf we stay, we will try to build democracy, but it will take a long time.  And if we leave, they will be angry with us.  They will have to start over and fix everything we broke.\n\nI do not know much about this topic.  I do not think we should call it a war anymore.  We do not have a good reason to stay.

            "I do not think it is right for a state to make something legal or illegal based on church rules. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control church decisions.\n\nIn the Constitution, it is written that church and state are separate. I think trying to make a law about this would be against what is already written. If the government tries to make a law, it would be like choosing one church's rules over another. Many Catholics and Christians do not support this.\n\nIt's not up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot say is right or wrong. The separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom in the United States.\n\nIf the government tries to make a law about this, it would be bad. It would be against what is already written in the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few laws that helps the government control people instead of helping keep them free.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. The President wants to change the law because he personally does not agree with it. This is not fair because it shows he likes one church over all others.\n\nThe churches should decide if something is right or wrong, not the government. There is no good reason for the President to try to change the law. It is just his personal view. I do not see how it would help the country or the economy. In fact, it might even help society more if it were left alone.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult issue. I don't think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war in general, especially when it involves a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government made the same mistakes in both wars.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in Iraq. The government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the consequences. The US government tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, but it was a difficult task. Democracy takes time to develop, and the US government did not do enough to prepare for the aftermath.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would not be easy. They should have planned for all possible outcomes. The government was not prepared for the void of power in Iraq and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. They should have considered the long-term effects of the war and the number of American casualties. The US government's main reason for invading Iraq was to control the country's oil resources.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and Iraq has peace soon. However, this may not happen.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always believed in it. I think it's a personal preference, and it's not something people should be judged for. Many scientists now think that being gay may be partly because of biology, not because of the way we're raised. I think it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nGovernments should not decide who can get married. It's a personal choice, not a government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live like any other family. They walk their dogs and take care of their homes just like everyone else. I think it's wrong for politicians to decide who can and can't get married.\n\nSome scientists say that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. People may be born that way, like some may be right-handed or left-handed. It's not because of how they were raised or what they learned.\n\nThe main problem is that gay people can't get married without being in the news. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big public issue. I think marriage should be a personal matter, not something that's decided by the government.\n\nI am against the government telling people who they can and can't marry. It's a private matter, and people should be free to make their own choices.",

If you put something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or bad things, people might say something. You can't control what others say.\n\nThe internet is public. If your friends see it on MySpace, they will get a bulletin. The school cannot ignore this. They must take it seriously. They can't just let it sit there, or something bad might happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nYou don't know what to believe because some people just joke around. But some things can be very serious. In our school situation, someone overheard a student talking and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that could be serious.\n\nWhen you post things on the internet, your privacy is not safe. If you don't want something out there, don't put it there. You can't control what others think of you. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. But if a student brings it to their attention, they must take it seriously. If there is danger, they have to act.\n\nSchool officials should not monitor students' phone conversations, texts, or internet chats. But if a student tells them about something, it's different.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nWhen it started, the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair government. But over time, I do not think this is the main reason we are still fighting. \n\nSome people might say our original goal was good, but I think our motives were not clear from the beginning. There were problems with the leader of the country, Saddam Hussein, and the U.S. president's father had disagreements with him. \n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy, that would have been a good reason for war.

            "I have a question.  A life was saved because someone looked at a person's profile on the internet.  This person looked on a website called Myspace.  On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile.  But if you are friends with them, you are giving them permission to see your profile.  So, when you put information on the internet, you know many people will see it.\n\nThis is a good thing.  But it is also a problem.  We can't have one person watching all the students' profiles to prevent bad things from happening.  This would be unfair.  We can't have someone's job be to watch what students are doing on the internet.\n\nI have a Facebook account.  I don't like that anyone can see things about me on the internet.  I know there are people who want to hurt others.  They can get information about you from your profile.  They can find out what you look like, where you go to school, and who your friends are.  They can even find out your schedule and where you are during the day.\n\nI try not to put too much information on my Facebook account.  But I also want to be able to talk to my friends.

There is no easy way to fix the Middle East. The United States and the Middle East have very different cultures. We cannot just bring democracy to a place where people do not want it.\n\nWe invaded Iraq because Saddam Hussein was a bad leader. But we must consider the consequences.

            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. This issue affects both men and women, depending on the work they do. Women often face difficulties in the workplace because of a concept called the \"glass ceiling.\" Even with equal qualifications, women may not get promoted because of a long history of men holding positions of power. This is because of how society has been taught to think.\n\nMen also face problems, especially in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. In these areas, men are often looked down upon because society expects them to work and make money. Stay-at-home dads often struggle because people think it's not normal for men to be at home caring for children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people may not take men seriously, especially if they are straight. This is because men who like fashion often have different lifestyles than others. If a man is in fashion, people may wonder if he really understands fashion for women.\n\nI believe that changing society's mindset about gender equality is hard. We have made progress, but it is slow. We are making progress as more women become CEOs and get accepted in business. Men are also becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to understand that it's okay.\n\nTo change, we need to promote people who are different from what society expects. We should show the good qualities of these people without being pushy. If we try too hard, people will resist. I think we are at a good point right now where people are starting to understand and accept differences.\n\nPeople from different places or with different backgrounds can also be discriminated against. For example, someone from a farm who wants to become a CEO may be looked down upon because of their grammar. This can happen between genders and within genders.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many problems with gender equality in the United States. Changing society takes time, and we are making progress slowly. We need to continue promoting equality and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it a less serious crime. \nIt is no longer a crime that can result in arrest and jailtime. \nNow it is like getting a traffic ticket. \nYou get a fine and it does not affect your future in a big way. \nHowever, some people worry about the future effects of a marijuana charge. \nEven if it is no longer a crime, it can still be a problem. \nBut some cities are saying that arresting people for marijuana is expensive. \nIt costs money to arrest, try, and jail people. \nSo, some cities are deciding not to make it a crime. \nIn Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay to make marijuana legal. \nThis can help the city make more money to spend on important things like schools and programs to help the elderly and the homeless. \nHowever, some people think that if marijuana were completely legal, it would be a problem. \nMore people might smoke it and drive, which is not safe. \nAlso, some people still think it is not right to smoke marijuana. \nIt is still not acceptable in many places. \nI do not know what to think. \nI think that alcohol can have more serious effects on people. \nBut marijuana can still be a problem for some people. \nEveryone reacts differently to substances. \nSome people can use them in a safe way, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say what the effects will be. \nI think that both marijuana and alcohol can have serious effects.",
            "I would say yes. \n\nHere's why. Many things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It is good to respect tradition. But it is also important to be open to change.\n\nSome Catholics think they have to go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes, the Catholic Church judges people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was also an Episcopalian. My mom was Catholic. But they could not marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching. But it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think some parts of Catholic teaching tell you what to do. But the way the Church acts is not always like this. It is too old-fashioned. But the Church still follows it.\n\nI do not think this would make a difference. I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. But I do not think this would stop them from behaving badly with children. It is a different situation.\n\nPeople who do bad things with children will probably do it anyway. It is not about being married or not. So, I do not think allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not thought about it deeply. I do not think either side is right or wrong. But I know this is a very difficult topic. It is hard because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are closely connected.\n\nI think a civil union is a good idea. It means that two people are together. They should not have to tell the government about their church or God. The government should only care about the fact that they are together.\n\nI also think about same-sex marriage. If two people love each other, they should be able to get a civil union. It does not matter if they are gay or not.\n\nIf all the states can come to an agreement, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough. We should not change the constitution for this reason.\n\nI do not think this issue is serious enough to change the constitution. We should just leave it alone.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. Homosexuality is a complex issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I do not think you should disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there, so I think you should respect the state's decision.\n\nI already said this, but I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. He cannot decide how every state should be. He lives in one state, but he is not in charge of all states. He will be out of office soon. If a democratic president is elected, they may lift the ban. It would just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think we should have a national law requiring all states to allow gay marriage. Each state should be free to make its own decision.",
            "I don't think it's a problem for the school officials to see a student's Myspace page.  Myspace is a public place where people can post things for others to see. If you post something there, it's like saying it out loud in a public place.  School officials can see it, but it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nIf they go on the internet to look for student behavior, that's to make the school a safer place. They might look for things like drinking or smoking. But I think it's okay if they do this to save lives. It's like a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nSchools can see what students are doing, even if it's not on the school's website. They can see it from home. So, it's not like an invasion of privacy. If they save lives or make the school a better place, I think it's okay.\n\nMany schools have rules and do things to keep students safe. They practice lock downs and drills in case of emergencies, like terrorist attacks. This is like what the school officials did in this case. They wanted to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nI think it's not a problem for school officials to see a student's Myspace page. They can see it if they want to. It's not an invasion of privacy. They are trying to make the school a safer place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by the 9/11 attack. I wanted to do something to help. But I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We went to war without a clear plan. I believe this led to problems for us. I now oppose the war. I do not think it helped. As long as the people in that country fight with each other, they cannot fight with us. I do not think our presence there helped.\n\nI stopped caring about the situation there because of the 9/11 attack. I do not think they are human. They fight with each other and cannot work together. I do not care what happens to them.\n\nWe went to war without being prepared. We did not know what to expect. War is different for them than for us. They are savage in war. I do not think they want to improve their country. I think they want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war for revenge. I do not think we thought about the consequences. President Bush wanted to go to war. Many people wanted to go to war because of 9/11. I understand why he made the decision. But I think we could have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not have a clear goal. We did not know what to do to create order. There was no unity among the people in charge. I think this made things worse. We created problems in that country because of our emotions. I do not think we can change the people there. I think they will always be the same.\n\nI do not think we are making progress. We made some progress, but it is not enough. I think the country will collapse when we leave. We cannot stay there forever. I think we are hurting ourselves by staying in that country."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community

every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Many people think the Church is losing followers because it is not accepting of some things. This is true of issues like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they may be a bit old-fashioned. If the Church changed its views to be more modern, it might keep more followers. \n\nMany people are turning against the Church because of its views on these issues. They do not agree with the Church's ideas. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so people who support abortion might not want to be part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in something and want to do it, but the Church does not agree, you might not want to be part of it.\n\nI also do not see why priests cannot be married or have women priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but I do not see why they cannot have both a job and a family. Everyone else in the world has a job and a family. Priests should be able to have both too. \n\nMaking these changes could help the Church keep its followers.",
            "I do not oppose gay marriage. I think people are born who they are. Some people are gay. I do not think it is a choice. They should not be blamed for how they are.\n\nIt seems that people are born gay or straight. I was born straight. I do not think it is fair to blame someone for being gay.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can marry whom. It is not a government issue. It is a personal issue.\n\nI do not think it is right to judge people. The federal government should not be involved in people's personal lives. They should be free to live as they are.\n\nPeople should not be punished for being gay. They are who they are, and that is not a choice.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. Here's why: \n\nThere's no good reason to stop it. Many people think gay couples harm the traditional family, but that's not true. They are different. There are many reasons to support it. It's like two different sides of the same coin. You can't have heads without tails. \n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples in many areas, like taxes and healthcare. If you're gay, your partner can't visit you in the hospital or make medical decisions for you. That's not fair. Many studies have shown that gay couples are like straight couples in many ways. They have the same level of happiness and success in their relationships.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church, but about getting a marriage certificate from the government. If the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It's not fair to say some people can have a marriage and others can't. That's like segregation.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their communities. They also worry about children of gay couples. But these are not good reasons. Children of gay parents can be happy and healthy just like children of straight parents. We need to treat all people equally.\n\nThe government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment against it is not fair. President Bush has strong views against gay marriage, but they are based on his religion. Morality is different for everyone. We shouldn't ignore the feelings and opinions of other groups in America.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are mentally ill or damaged. But that's not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I think some illegal drugs have good qualities. I do not think they should be available to the public. But I think they can be used for medical purposes.\n\nThere are many drugs that are illegal, but pharmacies use them. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. They are controlled substances. We use them because they are helpful. If we do not allow marijuana to be helpful because it is illegal, that makes no sense.\n\nI do not think marijuana is like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you misuse alcohol, that can also cause big problems. It is a difficult issue.\n\nI think we should make marijuana available gradually, not all at once. This way, people will not misuse it. First, we should remove the bad image that people have of marijuana. Many people think it is bad, but it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine.\n\nIf people do not think marijuana is bad, they may use it responsibly. And it can be helpful for medical reasons.",
            "The church has changed over the years to be more like the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I always went to church on Sundays. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes and a purse. I went to a private school, and my friends and I would attend church together. But now, the church has made some changes. They have a shorter church service, only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, even during summer. Some people wear beach clothes, and families arrive late. Even at early morning services, people wear jeans and khakis.\n\nThese changes are the biggest things I have noticed. I do not know about the church's politics, but these are the things that I see. \n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests regarding pedophilia, I do not think that changing the church rules, such as allowing female priests or married priests, could have prevented these problems. There are married men who have this problem. It is not because they are allowed to get married or not. Being a priest is a choice, and it is a choice that some people make. In some religions, priests can get married, like in the Seventh Heaven faith. If someone wants to get married and practice their faith, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with this problem, not because of how they are raised. It is not something that can be changed. The church could not have prevented this problem, unless they knew about it and chose to cover it up. In that case, that would be wrong.",
            "I have a problem with the war in Iraq.  The reason we went to war is still not clear.  People were still hurting from the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nI think the Bush administration lied to the American people. They said things that were not true. Colin Powell, who was a high government official, now says he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nThis is a serious problem. It is against the law for a government official to lie to the people. I think the Bush administration does not respect the law and the Constitution.\n\nThe administration wanted to go to war. They had a plan to go to war. They wanted to control Iraq's oil. This is not a good reason to go to war.\n\nThe war has lasted too long. If we leave now, the country might fall apart. Many people might die. The United Nations and the United States are trying to find a solution. They want a group of countries from the area to help restore order in Iraq.\n\nBut this is not a good idea. The country's leaders are not working well together. The government is not effective. People are fighting for control. This is not a good situation.\n\nI do not know what to think. I do not have a simple answer to this problem.",

But this is not a good reason to stay.\n\nIf we stay, we will try to build democracy, but it will take a long time.  And if we leave, they will be angry with us.  They will have to start over and fix everything we broke.\n\nI do not know much about this topic.  I do not think we should call it a war anymore.  We do not have a good reason to stay.

            "I do not think it is right for a state to make something legal or illegal based on church rules. The United States Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control church decisions.\n\nIn the Constitution, it is written that church and state are separate. I think trying to make a law about this would be against what is already written. If the government tries to make a law, it would be like choosing one church's rules over another. Many Catholics and Christians do not support this.\n\nIt's not up to the government to decide what churches can and cannot say is right or wrong. The separation of church and state is an important part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom in the United States.\n\nIf the government tries to make a law about this, it would be bad. It would be against what is already written in the Constitution. Also, it would be one of the few laws that helps the government control people instead of helping keep them free.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in this issue. The President wants to change the law because he personally does not agree with it. This is not fair because it shows he likes one church over all others.\n\nThe churches should decide if something is right or wrong, not the government. There is no good reason for the President to try to change the law. It is just his personal view. I do not see how it would help the country or the economy. In fact, it might even help society more if it were left alone.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult issue. I don't think the government was honest with the American people about the reasons for the war. Before the invasion, the government linked the war to the terrorist attacks of September 11th. However, the two events were not closely related.\n\nI am against war in general, especially when it involves a preemptive strike. I think the war in Iraq was similar to the Vietnam War. The US government made the same mistakes in both wars.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in Iraq. The government removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the consequences. The US government tried to install a democratic government in Iraq, but it was a difficult task. Democracy takes time to develop, and the US government did not do enough to prepare for the aftermath.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would not be easy. They should have planned for all possible outcomes. The government was not prepared for the void of power in Iraq and the chaos that followed.\n\nThe US government should not have gone to war without a clear plan. They should have considered the long-term effects of the war and the number of American casualties. The US government's main reason for invading Iraq was to control the country's oil resources.\n\nI hope the war ends soon and Iraq has peace soon. However, this may not happen.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always believed in it. I think it's a personal preference, and it's not something people should be judged for. Many scientists now think that being gay may be partly because of biology, not because of the way we're raised. I think it's unfair to deny people rights because of something they can't control.\n\nGovernments should not decide who can get married. It's a personal choice, not a government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live like any other family. They walk their dogs and take care of their homes just like everyone else. I think it's wrong for politicians to decide who can and can't get married.\n\nSome scientists say that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. People may be born that way, like some may be right-handed or left-handed. It's not because of how they were raised or what they learned.\n\nThe main problem is that gay people can't get married without being in the news. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it's a big public issue. I think marriage should be a personal matter, not something that's decided by the government.\n\nI am against the government telling people who they can and can't marry. It's a private matter, and people should be free to make their own choices.",

If you put something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or bad things, people might say something. You can't control what others say.\n\nThe internet is public. If your friends see it on MySpace, they will get a bulletin. The school cannot ignore this. They must take it seriously. They can't just let it sit there, or something bad might happen and they could have prevented it.\n\nYou don't know what to believe because some people just joke around. But some things can be very serious. In our school situation, someone overheard a student talking and told the school. They looked at the student's Facebook and found some things that could be serious.\n\nWhen you post things on the internet, your privacy is not safe. If you don't want something out there, don't put it there. You can't control what others think of you. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. But if a student brings it to their attention, they must take it seriously. If there is danger, they have to act.\n\nSchool officials should not monitor students' phone conversations, texts, or internet chats. But if a student tells them about something, it's different.

            "I think the war has lasted too long. \n\nWhen it started, the goal was to bring democracy to a country without a fair government. But over time, I do not think this is the main reason we are still fighting. \n\nSome people might say our original goal was good, but I think our motives were not clear from the beginning. There were problems with the leader of the country, Saddam Hussein, and the U.S. president's father had disagreements with him. \n\nIf the goal was to bring democracy, that would have been a good reason for war.

            "I have a question.  A life was saved because someone looked at a person's profile on the internet.  This person looked on a website called Myspace.  On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile.  But if you are friends with them, you are giving them permission to see your profile.  So, when you put information on the internet, you know many people will see it.\n\nThis is a good thing.  But it is also a problem.  We can't have one person watching all the students' profiles to prevent bad things from happening.  This would be unfair.  We can't have someone's job be to watch what students are doing on the internet.\n\nI have a Facebook account.  I don't like that anyone can see things about me on the internet.  I know there are people who want to hurt others.  They can get information about you from your profile.  They can find out what you look like, where you go to school, and who your friends are.  They can even find out your schedule and where you are during the day.\n\nI try not to put too much information on my Facebook account.  But I also want to be able to talk to my friends.

There is no easy way to fix the Middle East. The United States and the Middle East have very different cultures. We cannot just bring democracy to a place where people do not want it.\n\nWe invaded Iraq because Saddam Hussein was a bad leader. But we must consider the consequences.

            "I think there is still a problem with gender equality in the United States. This issue affects both men and women, depending on the work they do. Women often face difficulties in the workplace because of a concept called the \"glass ceiling.\" Even with equal qualifications, women may not get promoted because of a long history of men holding positions of power. This is because of how society has been taught to think.\n\nMen also face problems, especially in fields like fashion or being a stay-at-home parent. In these areas, men are often looked down upon because society expects them to work and make money. Stay-at-home dads often struggle because people think it's not normal for men to be at home caring for children.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people may not take men seriously, especially if they are straight. This is because men who like fashion often have different lifestyles than others. If a man is in fashion, people may wonder if he really understands fashion for women.\n\nI believe that changing society's mindset about gender equality is hard. We have made progress, but it is slow. We are making progress as more women become CEOs and get accepted in business. Men are also becoming stay-at-home dads, and people are starting to understand that it's okay.\n\nTo change, we need to promote people who are different from what society expects. We should show the good qualities of these people without being pushy. If we try too hard, people will resist. I think we are at a good point right now where people are starting to understand and accept differences.\n\nPeople from different places or with different backgrounds can also be discriminated against. For example, someone from a farm who wants to become a CEO may be looked down upon because of their grammar. This can happen between genders and within genders.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many problems with gender equality in the United States. Changing society takes time, and we are making progress slowly. We need to continue promoting equality and understanding.",
            "My understanding is that they did not make it legal. \nThey made it a less serious crime. \nIt is no longer a crime that can result in arrest and jailtime. \nNow it is like getting a traffic ticket. \nYou get a fine and it does not affect your future in a big way. \nHowever, some people worry about the future effects of a marijuana charge. \nEven if it is no longer a crime, it can still be a problem. \nBut some cities are saying that arresting people for marijuana is expensive. \nIt costs money to arrest, try, and jail people. \nSo, some cities are deciding not to make it a crime. \nIn Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it is okay to make marijuana legal. \nThis can help the city make more money to spend on important things like schools and programs to help the elderly and the homeless. \nHowever, some people think that if marijuana were completely legal, it would be a problem. \nMore people might smoke it and drive, which is not safe. \nAlso, some people still think it is not right to smoke marijuana. \nIt is still not acceptable in many places. \nI do not know what to think. \nI think that alcohol can have more serious effects on people. \nBut marijuana can still be a problem for some people. \nEveryone reacts differently to substances. \nSome people can use them in a safe way, but others cannot. \nSo, it is hard to say what the effects will be. \nI think that both marijuana and alcohol can have serious effects.",
            "I would say yes. \n\nHere's why. Many things the Catholic Church does are traditional. They do the same things for a long time. It is good to respect tradition. But it is also important to be open to change.\n\nSome Catholics think they have to go to church every week. They are strict about how things are done. Sometimes, the Catholic Church judges people who do not follow the rules exactly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my mom was an Episcopalian and my dad was also an Episcopalian. My mom was Catholic. But they could not marry in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion.\n\nThis is not being tolerant of other religions. We are taught to love others, which is a Catholic teaching. But it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them.\n\nI think some parts of Catholic teaching tell you what to do. But the way the Church acts is not always like this. It is too old-fashioned. But the Church still follows it.\n\nI do not think this would make a difference. I think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. But I do not think this would stop them from behaving badly with children. It is a different situation.\n\nPeople who do bad things with children will probably do it anyway. It is not about being married or not. So, I do not think allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not thought about it deeply. I do not think either side is right or wrong. But I know this is a very difficult topic. It is hard because the separation of church and state and the definition of marriage are closely connected.\n\nI think a civil union is a good idea. It means that two people are together. They should not have to tell the government about their church or God. The government should only care about the fact that they are together.\n\nI also think about same-sex marriage. If two people love each other, they should be able to get a civil union. It does not matter if they are gay or not.\n\nIf all the states can come to an agreement, they should make it a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not important enough. We should not change the constitution for this reason.\n\nI do not think this issue is serious enough to change the constitution. We should just leave it alone.",
            "I grew up in a Christian family. Homosexuality is a complex issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nMany states are democratic or republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how that state feels about the issue. I do not think you should disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there, so I think you should respect the state's decision.\n\nI already said this, but I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage.\n\nI disagree with President Bush's ban on gay marriage. He cannot decide how every state should be. He lives in one state, but he is not in charge of all states. He will be out of office soon. If a democratic president is elected, they may lift the ban. It would just go back and forth. Each state should decide for itself. They will have to live with the decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think we should have a national law requiring all states to allow gay marriage. Each state should be free to make its own decision.",
            "I don't think it's a problem for the school officials to see a student's Myspace page.  Myspace is a public place where people can post things for others to see. If you post something there, it's like saying it out loud in a public place.  School officials can see it, but it's not an invasion of privacy.\n\nIf they go on the internet to look for student behavior, that's to make the school a safer place. They might look for things like drinking or smoking. But I think it's okay if they do this to save lives. It's like a responsibility of the school to keep students safe.\n\nSchools can see what students are doing, even if it's not on the school's website. They can see it from home. So, it's not like an invasion of privacy. If they save lives or make the school a better place, I think it's okay.\n\nMany schools have rules and do things to keep students safe. They practice lock downs and drills in case of emergencies, like terrorist attacks. This is like what the school officials did in this case. They wanted to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting.\n\nI think it's not a problem for school officials to see a student's Myspace page. They can see it if they want to. It's not an invasion of privacy. They are trying to make the school a safer place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by the 9/11 attack. I wanted to do something to help. But I think we did not think about the long-term effects. We went to war without a clear plan. I believe this led to problems for us. I now oppose the war. I do not think it helped. As long as the people in that country fight with each other, they cannot fight with us. I do not think our presence there helped.\n\nI stopped caring about the situation there because of the 9/11 attack. I do not think they are human. They fight with each other and cannot work together. I do not care what happens to them.\n\nWe went to war without being prepared. We did not know what to expect. War is different for them than for us. They are savage in war. I do not think they want to improve their country. I think they want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war for revenge. I do not think we thought about the consequences. President Bush wanted to go to war. Many people wanted to go to war because of 9/11. I understand why he made the decision. But I think we could have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not have a clear goal. We did not know what to do to create order. There was no unity among the people in charge. I think this made things worse. We created problems in that country because of our emotions. I do not think we can change the people there. I think they will always be the same.\n\nI do not think we are making progress. We made some progress, but it is not enough. I think the country will collapse when we leave. We cannot stay there forever. I think we are hurting ourselves by staying in that country."
