            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not accepting of some things. This includes gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they are old-fashioned. If the Church changed its views, it might not lose followers. \n\nSome people are unhappy with the Church because it does not agree with them on certain issues. For example, the Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage and other issues. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with your beliefs.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or priests to be married. However, this may not have prevented the problems the Church faces. It is hard to say. \n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married. The Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Some are born straight and some are born gay. They should not be blamed for this. If someone is born with a condition, we don't blame them, do we?\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in something like this. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of treating people fairly. I don't think it's right for the government to tell people who they can and cannot marry.\n\nThe government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should not judge people for who they are. People are born gay, and that's okay. They should not be punished for this.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and they have different needs.

This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same kind of relationships and the same kind of problems. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want to allow gay couples to get married because of their religion. But this is not a reason to deny them their rights. \n\nIf you are not allowed to get married in a church, why can't you get a marriage certificate from the government? \n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. \n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how gay couples will affect their community. But they should not be. \n\nGay couples are the same as straight couples in many ways. They have the same kind of relationships and the same kinds of problems. \n\nThey can be good parents and good members of their community. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush and some other people have strong feelings about this issue because of their religion.

I think it would be a good idea to make marijuana legal gradually, not all at once. This way, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad opinion of marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change our opinion of marijuana, people might use it sensibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed a lot since the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday as a child. I wore cute dresses and matching shoes. I attended a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They have a 30-minute mass for teenagers. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes or jeans and khakis.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's how I see it. Some people may think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to marry, these problems could have been prevented. But I don't think that's true. There are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's the person themselves.\n\nSome other religions already allow priests to be married. For example, Seventh-day Adventists have reverends who can get married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might choose a different church. I think the church couldn't have prevented these problems. Maybe the church just didn't know about the abuse or tried to hide it. But it's not because of the rules they have.\n\nI also think that pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born that way. It's not because of how they were raised. While it's true that environment can play a role, I don't think it's the main reason. You can't hide someone's true nature through a marriage. If they have these feelings, they will usually come out.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a problem. But I don't think that was always the case. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church.",
            "I was not happy with the reason for going to war in Iraq. Many people were still upset about the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration said we went to war because of these attacks and because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, even said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is very bad.

They have not done what they said they would do since September 11th.\n\nI think they wanted to go to war from the beginning. A former official said this in a book. He said that President Bush wanted to go to war because his father had problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nNow, the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, there may be problems. Many people will die. The United Nations and the United States are trying a new plan. They want to work with nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to bring order to Iraq. But I think this may cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in control of its own country. The government is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have control.

I want the war to end because it is making their lives difficult. However, if we leave, we may make things worse for Iraq. \n\nWe are trying to change their culture, but it may not work.

            "The war in Iraq was not a good thing. The government did not tell the American people the truth about why they wanted to go to war. They made it seem like Iraq was connected to the terrorist attacks on September 11th, but that was not true. The government wanted to start the war in 2003, and many Americans did not agree.\n\nI am against war, especially a war that is not necessary. The US government should not have started the war in Iraq. It was like the Vietnam War, where the US government made mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war, and that was very sad.\n\nThe US government removed the Iraqi government, but they did not plan for what would happen after that. They thought it would be easy to create a new government, but it was not. The US government should have learned from past mistakes.\n\nThe US government wanted to create a democratic government in Iraq, but that was not an easy task. It is not easy to create a new government, and it takes a long time. The US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it was not.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was thinking about voting in the 2004 presidential election, and one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. But then I thought about the many American soldiers who died in the war, and I wondered if it was worth it.\n\nThe US government said they were going to Iraq to make it a democratic nation, but I am not sure why they only wanted to do that in Iraq. Why not in other countries too? I think it is because of the oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq, and that is why they went to war.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but the US did not go to war with them. I think the US government is not being honest in their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace in the country. But I do not think that will happen soon.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. Science has shown that being gay may be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. People are not responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it is unfair to deny them the right to marry because of something they cannot control.\n\nI do not think government should be involved in this issue. Marriage is a personal matter, not a government decision. It is not a state issue, it is a personal one. In my neighborhood, I know of two or three gay couples who are not married. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like anyone else.\n\nI think it is wrong for the government to try to decide what marriage means. It is not their place to interpret what marriage is. I think it is ridiculous for someone like President Bush to try to decide what marriage is.\n\nI have read and heard that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. It may be something people are born with, not something they develop because of their environment. This is different from being gay because of how they are raised.\n\nThe only reason I can think of to not allow gay marriage is that it may be seen as different. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately in Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to get married, it will be on the front page of the news. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.",

If you talk about violence or bad things happening, people might react. You should not put that online.\n\nThe internet is for everyone to see.

            "I think the war has gone on for too long. I believe the purpose was good at first. We wanted to help another country have a democracy. But now, I think we're fighting just for the sake of fighting. It's like we want to prove we're a strong nation. I'm not sure the reasons for the war were fair. There were personal problems with the leader of Iraq. George Bush's father had conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be good. But I don't think our reason for the war is fair now.\n\nI think we made our point in the first few months. The war was a statement. But it's been going on for many years. I think it's too long. If we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason for the war. But I don't think that's our reason anymore. I think we're fighting just to fight.\n\nI think the war has lasted too long. The country we're fighting to help should now be able to govern itself. We're spending a lot of money on the war. We have problems at home, like poverty. We should be spending money on those problems. The war is also hurting our economy. There are other important things we should be spending money on, like public roads and schools. I think the money would be better spent on our own country's needs.\n\nWe're spending billions of dollars on the war. War shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have many problems at home that need to be solved. We should be spending money on things like healthcare, which is very important. Instead, we're spending money to kill our own citizens in a war we're losing.",
            "I have a question. Do you want me to clarify something?\n\nIt happened because someone looked online and found something. They went to a website called Myspace. When you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nAnytime you put information on the internet, you need to know that many people will see it. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHowever, it's a problem if one person looks at everyone's profiles all the time. That is not fair. It's like looking at people and deciding who is good or bad. That's not right.\n\nI don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it depends on why they looked at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI don't have a Myspace account, but I have a Facebook account. It worries me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a show on TV about a man who wanted to prove how easy it is to get information about people. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name in less than a minute. He even talked to her on instant messenger.\n\nIt's hard because people you don't know can talk to you and know things about you. They can even see your photos and know where you are during the day. It's a problem because you think you're safe, but you're not.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but I don't want to limit it too much. I want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a tricky issue because you never know who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I don't understand how the school officials had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's a question of privacy.",
            "The Iraq War is a topic I do not like to discuss. I feel bad talking about it because many people already know my opinion. I was against the war from the start. But it is not important now because everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in charge. They do not want to admit they were wrong.\n\nNew polls show that 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis and 70 percent of American soldiers in Iraq think the war was a bad idea. They think the United States should leave Iraq within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we went there. Now it is even worse. There is no easy way to solve the problem. The United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The United States wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but was the war the best way to stop him? Before we went to war, we should have thought about the good and the bad. The war was like quicksand. We got stuck and now we are in trouble.\n\nI do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The government may have ideas about why we should stay, but I do not agree with them. If they say we can leave gradually over a year, I would not be opposed to that. But I do not see a reason why we should not leave now.\n\nIn fact, 80 percent of Iraqis think we should leave within a year. They are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen. If we leave, we can say we tried to help them. If something goes wrong, we can say they made the decision to leave.\n\nI do not think we will ever be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with unfair treatment of people because of their sex in the United States. Women have a harder time than men in many jobs. It is like a \"glass ceiling\" that makes it difficult for women to get ahead. Many people have difficulty accepting women in important positions. This is because of how society has taught them to think. \n\nIn some jobs, like business, it is rare to find a man working under a woman. People think women are not good leaders. But many women are very qualified for important jobs. They have the skills and knowledge to do the work. However, they may not be chosen for a position because of how things have been in the past. It is the same for men in some jobs, like fashion. They may not be taken seriously if they are not like other men who work in fashion. \n\nIf a man wants to stay at home to take care of his children, many people do not understand this. They think a man should work and earn money for the family. But some men want to stay home and take care of their children. This can be hard for them because people do not accept it. \n\nTo change this, we need to be patient. We have made progress, but it takes time. If we push too hard for change, people may resist. It is like a slow process. But we are moving forward. More women are getting important jobs and more men are staying home to care for their children. We need to show the good qualities of people who are often judged unfairly. We should not be too pushy, but we should show people that they are capable and qualified. \n\nWe also have to remember that people from different places and backgrounds may be judged unfairly. For example, someone who grew up on a farm may not have good grammar, but they may be very smart and capable. Other people may judge them because of their grammar. We need to respect and accept people for who they are, not for how they speak or where they come from.",
            "I think they did not make it a crime. \nThey made it less serious. \nIt is no longer a crime, but more like a traffic ticket. \nYou get a warning and do not go to jail. \nThis is good because people do not have to worry about getting in trouble for a long time. \nBut, some people are still concerned about the future. \nEven if it is not a crime, it can still make it hard to get a job. \nIt can still cause problems. \nBut, some people think it is a good idea to not spend so much money on arresting people and taking them to court. \nIt costs a lot to arrest, take to court, and keep someone in jail. \nSo, if a city is in trouble and does not have much money, they might not want to make it legal. \nHowever, some cities with more open-minded people think it is okay. \nThey can use the money they save to help other things, like schools and programs for the elderly. \nIt is a good idea because marijuana is not something we want on the streets. \nBut it is also about money and how we use our money. \nSome people think it should be sold like cigarettes, but that might be bad because people might smoke and drive. \nIt is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSo, it would be awkward to have it out in the open. \nAlcohol can hurt people's ability to drive, but marijuana can hurt people's lives in other ways. \nEvery person reacts differently to substances. \nSome people can handle them easily, but others cannot. \nIt makes it hard to say for sure how bad marijuana is.",
            "I say yes. \nBecause many things they do are very traditional. \nThey have done the same things for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be flexible and change. \n\nFor example, in the Catholic Church, many people must go to church every week. \nThey have strict rules for how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were from different religions. \nMy mom was Episcopalian and my dad was Episcopalian too. \nMy mom was a Catholic, but they could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic teaching is to love others. \nBut it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them. \nI think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the practice of the Church goes against it. \nThis is because the practice is old-fashioned, but the Church continues to do it anyway. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who do bad things will keep doing them, no matter what. \nIt is not the same to be married as it is to have a child. \nSo, it is not likely that allowing priests to be married would prevent bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure yet about this issue. It is very difficult to say if one side is right or wrong. The problem is between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. This is a hard problem because it is very sensitive.\n\nI think a civil union is the same as marriage. It is a union between two people. The government should not look at the kind of marriage or if the people were baptized. Marriage is just two people together.\n\nIf all states agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It is not big enough.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. I have some thoughts about homosexuality. It is a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to make their own choices. I do not think the government should decide for everyone. \n\nDifferent states have different opinions. Some states are democratic and others are republican. If you live in a democratic state, you agree with their decisions. If you do not like the decision, you can move to a different state. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. They should be able to get married if a state allows it. \n\nI already said this, but I will say it again. I do not think President Bush should decide what all states can and cannot do. It is up to each state to decide for itself. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will not be in office forever. If a new president does not like his decision, they can change it. Each state should make its own decisions because they will live with the results. It is not the president's job to decide for everyone. \n\nDo I want a ban on gay marriage? No, I do not.",
            "I don't agree with what you said. Let me explain. Myspace is a public place where people can post things for others to see. If you post something on Myspace, you have to know that others will see it. That includes school officials.\n\nIn this case, the school officials checked Myspace to prevent a school shooting. I think that's okay. The school's responsibility is to keep students safe. If they can find something on Myspace that helps them do that, I think that's fine.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to catch students breaking the rules. But I think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they use Myspace to make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion.\n\nIt's like when you post something on the internet. It's hard to control who sees it. I'm careful about what I post because I know it can come back to haunt me.\n\nIf you post something bad about someone on the internet, you can get in trouble. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. School officials shouldn't go on the internet just to catch students, but if they find something that helps keep the school safe, I think that's okay.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to be careful. They have to make sure students are safe. We practiced what to do in case of an emergency. School officials were just trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were doing what they thought was best to keep students safe. That's their job.",
            "I think about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. The attack on 9/11 affected me personally. I wanted to do something about it. I thought we should go to the country where the attack came from and cause some trouble. But I think we did not think about the long-term results. We went there without a clear plan. I believe this was a mistake. \n\nNow, I do not think the war was a good idea. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight with us too. I do not think our presence there will make a difference. They will continue to fight each other. \n\nBecause of 9/11, I have lost interest in what is happening in that country. I see the people there as not truly human. They fight and cannot work together. We should have thought before we went there. We did not know what to expect. The way they fight is different from how we fight. I think they want us to leave, not help them. \n\nI think we went there for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq. The people wanted revenge for 9/11. I understand why he did it, but I do not think it was the right decision. We could not just let Iraq do what it wanted and then expect us to rebuild it. \n\nWe did not have a clear plan for what to do in Iraq. We did not know what we were doing. We should have been more careful and thought more about the consequences. I do not think we can change the people in Iraq. They will always be like that. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. If we leave, the country will probably collapse. We are hurting ourselves by staying there. We should leave and stop fighting."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not accepting of some things. This includes gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they are old-fashioned. If the Church changed its views, it might not lose followers. \n\nSome people are unhappy with the Church because it does not agree with them on certain issues. For example, the Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage and other issues. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with your beliefs.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or priests to be married. However, this may not have prevented the problems the Church faces. It is hard to say. \n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married. The Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Some are born straight and some are born gay. They should not be blamed for this. If someone is born with a condition, we don't blame them, do we?\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in something like this. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of treating people fairly. I don't think it's right for the government to tell people who they can and cannot marry.\n\nThe government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should not judge people for who they are. People are born gay, and that's okay. They should not be punished for this.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and they have different needs.

This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same kind of relationships and the same kind of problems. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want to allow gay couples to get married because of their religion. But this is not a reason to deny them their rights. \n\nIf you are not allowed to get married in a church, why can't you get a marriage certificate from the government? \n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. \n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how gay couples will affect their community. But they should not be. \n\nGay couples are the same as straight couples in many ways. They have the same kind of relationships and the same kinds of problems. \n\nThey can be good parents and good members of their community. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush and some other people have strong feelings about this issue because of their religion.

I think it would be a good idea to make marijuana legal gradually, not all at once. This way, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad opinion of marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change our opinion of marijuana, people might use it sensibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed a lot since the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday as a child. I wore cute dresses and matching shoes. I attended a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They have a 30-minute mass for teenagers. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes or jeans and khakis.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's how I see it. Some people may think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to marry, these problems could have been prevented. But I don't think that's true. There are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's the person themselves.\n\nSome other religions already allow priests to be married. For example, Seventh-day Adventists have reverends who can get married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might choose a different church. I think the church couldn't have prevented these problems. Maybe the church just didn't know about the abuse or tried to hide it. But it's not because of the rules they have.\n\nI also think that pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born that way. It's not because of how they were raised. While it's true that environment can play a role, I don't think it's the main reason. You can't hide someone's true nature through a marriage. If they have these feelings, they will usually come out.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a problem. But I don't think that was always the case. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church.",
            "I was not happy with the reason for going to war in Iraq. Many people were still upset about the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration said we went to war because of these attacks and because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, even said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is very bad.

They have not done what they said they would do since September 11th.\n\nI think they wanted to go to war from the beginning. A former official said this in a book. He said that President Bush wanted to go to war because his father had problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nNow, the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, there may be problems. Many people will die. The United Nations and the United States are trying a new plan. They want to work with nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to bring order to Iraq. But I think this may cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in control of its own country. The government is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have control.

I want the war to end because it is making their lives difficult. However, if we leave, we may make things worse for Iraq. \n\nWe are trying to change their culture, but it may not work.

            "The war in Iraq was not a good thing. The government did not tell the American people the truth about why they wanted to go to war. They made it seem like Iraq was connected to the terrorist attacks on September 11th, but that was not true. The government wanted to start the war in 2003, and many Americans did not agree.\n\nI am against war, especially a war that is not necessary. The US government should not have started the war in Iraq. It was like the Vietnam War, where the US government made mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war, and that was very sad.\n\nThe US government removed the Iraqi government, but they did not plan for what would happen after that. They thought it would be easy to create a new government, but it was not. The US government should have learned from past mistakes.\n\nThe US government wanted to create a democratic government in Iraq, but that was not an easy task. It is not easy to create a new government, and it takes a long time. The US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it was not.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was thinking about voting in the 2004 presidential election, and one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. But then I thought about the many American soldiers who died in the war, and I wondered if it was worth it.\n\nThe US government said they were going to Iraq to make it a democratic nation, but I am not sure why they only wanted to do that in Iraq. Why not in other countries too? I think it is because of the oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq, and that is why they went to war.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but the US did not go to war with them. I think the US government is not being honest in their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace in the country. But I do not think that will happen soon.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. Science has shown that being gay may be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. People are not responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it is unfair to deny them the right to marry because of something they cannot control.\n\nI do not think government should be involved in this issue. Marriage is a personal matter, not a government decision. It is not a state issue, it is a personal one. In my neighborhood, I know of two or three gay couples who are not married. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like anyone else.\n\nI think it is wrong for the government to try to decide what marriage means. It is not their place to interpret what marriage is. I think it is ridiculous for someone like President Bush to try to decide what marriage is.\n\nI have read and heard that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. It may be something people are born with, not something they develop because of their environment. This is different from being gay because of how they are raised.\n\nThe only reason I can think of to not allow gay marriage is that it may be seen as different. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately in Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to get married, it will be on the front page of the news. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.",

If you talk about violence or bad things happening, people might react. You should not put that online.\n\nThe internet is for everyone to see.

            "I think the war has gone on for too long. I believe the purpose was good at first. We wanted to help another country have a democracy. But now, I think we're fighting just for the sake of fighting. It's like we want to prove we're a strong nation. I'm not sure the reasons for the war were fair. There were personal problems with the leader of Iraq. George Bush's father had conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be good. But I don't think our reason for the war is fair now.\n\nI think we made our point in the first few months. The war was a statement. But it's been going on for many years. I think it's too long. If we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason for the war. But I don't think that's our reason anymore. I think we're fighting just to fight.\n\nI think the war has lasted too long. The country we're fighting to help should now be able to govern itself. We're spending a lot of money on the war. We have problems at home, like poverty. We should be spending money on those problems. The war is also hurting our economy. There are other important things we should be spending money on, like public roads and schools. I think the money would be better spent on our own country's needs.\n\nWe're spending billions of dollars on the war. War shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have many problems at home that need to be solved. We should be spending money on things like healthcare, which is very important. Instead, we're spending money to kill our own citizens in a war we're losing.",
            "I have a question. Do you want me to clarify something?\n\nIt happened because someone looked online and found something. They went to a website called Myspace. When you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nAnytime you put information on the internet, you need to know that many people will see it. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHowever, it's a problem if one person looks at everyone's profiles all the time. That is not fair. It's like looking at people and deciding who is good or bad. That's not right.\n\nI don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it depends on why they looked at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI don't have a Myspace account, but I have a Facebook account. It worries me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a show on TV about a man who wanted to prove how easy it is to get information about people. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name in less than a minute. He even talked to her on instant messenger.\n\nIt's hard because people you don't know can talk to you and know things about you. They can even see your photos and know where you are during the day. It's a problem because you think you're safe, but you're not.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but I don't want to limit it too much. I want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a tricky issue because you never know who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I don't understand how the school officials had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's a question of privacy.",
            "The Iraq War is a topic I do not like to discuss. I feel bad talking about it because many people already know my opinion. I was against the war from the start. But it is not important now because everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in charge. They do not want to admit they were wrong.\n\nNew polls show that 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis and 70 percent of American soldiers in Iraq think the war was a bad idea. They think the United States should leave Iraq within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we went there. Now it is even worse. There is no easy way to solve the problem. The United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The United States wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but was the war the best way to stop him? Before we went to war, we should have thought about the good and the bad. The war was like quicksand. We got stuck and now we are in trouble.\n\nI do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The government may have ideas about why we should stay, but I do not agree with them. If they say we can leave gradually over a year, I would not be opposed to that. But I do not see a reason why we should not leave now.\n\nIn fact, 80 percent of Iraqis think we should leave within a year. They are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen. If we leave, we can say we tried to help them. If something goes wrong, we can say they made the decision to leave.\n\nI do not think we will ever be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with unfair treatment of people because of their sex in the United States. Women have a harder time than men in many jobs. It is like a \"glass ceiling\" that makes it difficult for women to get ahead. Many people have difficulty accepting women in important positions. This is because of how society has taught them to think. \n\nIn some jobs, like business, it is rare to find a man working under a woman. People think women are not good leaders. But many women are very qualified for important jobs. They have the skills and knowledge to do the work. However, they may not be chosen for a position because of how things have been in the past. It is the same for men in some jobs, like fashion. They may not be taken seriously if they are not like other men who work in fashion. \n\nIf a man wants to stay at home to take care of his children, many people do not understand this. They think a man should work and earn money for the family. But some men want to stay home and take care of their children. This can be hard for them because people do not accept it. \n\nTo change this, we need to be patient. We have made progress, but it takes time. If we push too hard for change, people may resist. It is like a slow process. But we are moving forward. More women are getting important jobs and more men are staying home to care for their children. We need to show the good qualities of people who are often judged unfairly. We should not be too pushy, but we should show people that they are capable and qualified. \n\nWe also have to remember that people from different places and backgrounds may be judged unfairly. For example, someone who grew up on a farm may not have good grammar, but they may be very smart and capable. Other people may judge them because of their grammar. We need to respect and accept people for who they are, not for how they speak or where they come from.",
            "I think they did not make it a crime. \nThey made it less serious. \nIt is no longer a crime, but more like a traffic ticket. \nYou get a warning and do not go to jail. \nThis is good because people do not have to worry about getting in trouble for a long time. \nBut, some people are still concerned about the future. \nEven if it is not a crime, it can still make it hard to get a job. \nIt can still cause problems. \nBut, some people think it is a good idea to not spend so much money on arresting people and taking them to court. \nIt costs a lot to arrest, take to court, and keep someone in jail. \nSo, if a city is in trouble and does not have much money, they might not want to make it legal. \nHowever, some cities with more open-minded people think it is okay. \nThey can use the money they save to help other things, like schools and programs for the elderly. \nIt is a good idea because marijuana is not something we want on the streets. \nBut it is also about money and how we use our money. \nSome people think it should be sold like cigarettes, but that might be bad because people might smoke and drive. \nIt is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSo, it would be awkward to have it out in the open. \nAlcohol can hurt people's ability to drive, but marijuana can hurt people's lives in other ways. \nEvery person reacts differently to substances. \nSome people can handle them easily, but others cannot. \nIt makes it hard to say for sure how bad marijuana is.",
            "I say yes. \nBecause many things they do are very traditional. \nThey have done the same things for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be flexible and change. \n\nFor example, in the Catholic Church, many people must go to church every week. \nThey have strict rules for how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were from different religions. \nMy mom was Episcopalian and my dad was Episcopalian too. \nMy mom was a Catholic, but they could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic teaching is to love others. \nBut it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them. \nI think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the practice of the Church goes against it. \nThis is because the practice is old-fashioned, but the Church continues to do it anyway. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who do bad things will keep doing them, no matter what. \nIt is not the same to be married as it is to have a child. \nSo, it is not likely that allowing priests to be married would prevent bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure yet about this issue. It is very difficult to say if one side is right or wrong. The problem is between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. This is a hard problem because it is very sensitive.\n\nI think a civil union is the same as marriage. It is a union between two people. The government should not look at the kind of marriage or if the people were baptized. Marriage is just two people together.\n\nIf all states agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It is not big enough.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. I have some thoughts about homosexuality. It is a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to make their own choices. I do not think the government should decide for everyone. \n\nDifferent states have different opinions. Some states are democratic and others are republican. If you live in a democratic state, you agree with their decisions. If you do not like the decision, you can move to a different state. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. They should be able to get married if a state allows it. \n\nI already said this, but I will say it again. I do not think President Bush should decide what all states can and cannot do. It is up to each state to decide for itself. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will not be in office forever. If a new president does not like his decision, they can change it. Each state should make its own decisions because they will live with the results. It is not the president's job to decide for everyone. \n\nDo I want a ban on gay marriage? No, I do not.",
            "I don't agree with what you said. Let me explain. Myspace is a public place where people can post things for others to see. If you post something on Myspace, you have to know that others will see it. That includes school officials.\n\nIn this case, the school officials checked Myspace to prevent a school shooting. I think that's okay. The school's responsibility is to keep students safe. If they can find something on Myspace that helps them do that, I think that's fine.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to catch students breaking the rules. But I think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they use Myspace to make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion.\n\nIt's like when you post something on the internet. It's hard to control who sees it. I'm careful about what I post because I know it can come back to haunt me.\n\nIf you post something bad about someone on the internet, you can get in trouble. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. School officials shouldn't go on the internet just to catch students, but if they find something that helps keep the school safe, I think that's okay.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to be careful. They have to make sure students are safe. We practiced what to do in case of an emergency. School officials were just trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were doing what they thought was best to keep students safe. That's their job.",
            "I think about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. The attack on 9/11 affected me personally. I wanted to do something about it. I thought we should go to the country where the attack came from and cause some trouble. But I think we did not think about the long-term results. We went there without a clear plan. I believe this was a mistake. \n\nNow, I do not think the war was a good idea. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight with us too. I do not think our presence there will make a difference. They will continue to fight each other. \n\nBecause of 9/11, I have lost interest in what is happening in that country. I see the people there as not truly human. They fight and cannot work together. We should have thought before we went there. We did not know what to expect. The way they fight is different from how we fight. I think they want us to leave, not help them. \n\nI think we went there for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq. The people wanted revenge for 9/11. I understand why he did it, but I do not think it was the right decision. We could not just let Iraq do what it wanted and then expect us to rebuild it. \n\nWe did not have a clear plan for what to do in Iraq. We did not know what we were doing. We should have been more careful and thought more about the consequences. I do not think we can change the people in Iraq. They will always be like that. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. If we leave, the country will probably collapse. We are hurting ourselves by staying there. We should leave and stop fighting."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. Many people are leaving the Church because it is not accepting of some things. This includes gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they are old-fashioned. If the Church changed its views, it might not lose followers. \n\nSome people are unhappy with the Church because it does not agree with them on certain issues. For example, the Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you may not want to be part of a Church that says it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage and other issues. You may not want to be in a Church that does not agree with your beliefs.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or priests to be married. However, this may not have prevented the problems the Church faces. It is hard to say. \n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married. The Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. I do not see why priests cannot have both.",

Some are born straight and some are born gay. They should not be blamed for this. If someone is born with a condition, we don't blame them, do we?\n\nI don't think the federal government should get involved in something like this. It's not a matter of law, but rather a matter of treating people fairly. I don't think it's right for the government to tell people who they can and cannot marry.\n\nThe government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should not judge people for who they are. People are born gay, and that's okay. They should not be punished for this.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. \n\nThere is no good reason not to. \n\nSome people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. \n\nGay couples are different, and they have different needs.

This is not fair. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same kind of relationships and the same kind of problems. \n\nThe main issue is that some people do not want to allow gay couples to get married because of their religion. But this is not a reason to deny them their rights. \n\nIf you are not allowed to get married in a church, why can't you get a marriage certificate from the government? \n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. \n\nSome people are worried about adoption and how gay couples will affect their community. But they should not be. \n\nGay couples are the same as straight couples in many ways. They have the same kind of relationships and the same kinds of problems. \n\nThey can be good parents and good members of their community. \n\nThe government should help make gay marriage legal in all states. \n\nPresident Bush and some other people have strong feelings about this issue because of their religion.

I think it would be a good idea to make marijuana legal gradually, not all at once. This way, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad opinion of marijuana because it is against the law. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change our opinion of marijuana, people might use it sensibly, especially for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed a lot since the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I grew up going to church every Sunday as a child. I wore cute dresses and matching shoes. I attended a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends. But now, the church has made some changes. They have a 30-minute mass for teenagers. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes or jeans and khakis.\n\nI think this is the biggest change I've noticed. I don't know much about the church's politics, but that's how I see it. Some people may think that if the church allowed female priests or priests to marry, these problems could have been prevented. But I don't think that's true. There are married men who still become pedophiles. It's not because they're allowed to get married or not. It's the person themselves.\n\nSome other religions already allow priests to be married. For example, Seventh-day Adventists have reverends who can get married. If someone wants to practice their faith and be married, they might choose a different church. I think the church couldn't have prevented these problems. Maybe the church just didn't know about the abuse or tried to hide it. But it's not because of the rules they have.\n\nI also think that pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born that way. It's not because of how they were raised. While it's true that environment can play a role, I don't think it's the main reason. You can't hide someone's true nature through a marriage. If they have these feelings, they will usually come out.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that's a problem. But I don't think that was always the case. I don't have any other thoughts on the Catholic Church.",
            "I was not happy with the reason for going to war in Iraq. Many people were still upset about the September 11th attacks. The Bush administration said we went to war because of these attacks and because Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.

Colin Powell, a high-ranking official, even said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is very bad.

They have not done what they said they would do since September 11th.\n\nI think they wanted to go to war from the beginning. A former official said this in a book. He said that President Bush wanted to go to war because his father had problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nNow, the war has gone on too long. If we leave now, there may be problems. Many people will die. The United Nations and the United States are trying a new plan. They want to work with nearby countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia to bring order to Iraq. But I think this may cause more problems in the long run.\n\nIraq will have trouble being in control of its own country. The government is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have control.

I want the war to end because it is making their lives difficult. However, if we leave, we may make things worse for Iraq. \n\nWe are trying to change their culture, but it may not work.

            "The war in Iraq was not a good thing. The government did not tell the American people the truth about why they wanted to go to war. They made it seem like Iraq was connected to the terrorist attacks on September 11th, but that was not true. The government wanted to start the war in 2003, and many Americans did not agree.\n\nI am against war, especially a war that is not necessary. The US government should not have started the war in Iraq. It was like the Vietnam War, where the US government made mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war, and that was very sad.\n\nThe US government removed the Iraqi government, but they did not plan for what would happen after that. They thought it would be easy to create a new government, but it was not. The US government should have learned from past mistakes.\n\nThe US government wanted to create a democratic government in Iraq, but that was not an easy task. It is not easy to create a new government, and it takes a long time. The US government made it seem like it would be easy, but it was not.\n\nI had mixed feelings about the war in Iraq. I was thinking about voting in the 2004 presidential election, and one of my reasons for voting for George Bush was to let him finish what he started. But then I thought about the many American soldiers who died in the war, and I wondered if it was worth it.\n\nThe US government said they were going to Iraq to make it a democratic nation, but I am not sure why they only wanted to do that in Iraq. Why not in other countries too? I think it is because of the oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq, and that is why they went to war.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they never found any. North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but the US did not go to war with them. I think the US government is not being honest in their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace in the country. But I do not think that will happen soon.",
            "I am for gay marriage. I have always been. I think it is a personal preference. Science has shown that being gay may be biological, not just a matter of how people are raised. People are not responsible for their sexual orientation. I think it is unfair to deny them the right to marry because of something they cannot control.\n\nI do not think government should be involved in this issue. Marriage is a personal matter, not a government decision. It is not a state issue, it is a personal one. In my neighborhood, I know of two or three gay couples who are not married. They live like any other family. They walk their dogs and live their lives like anyone else.\n\nI think it is wrong for the government to try to decide what marriage means. It is not their place to interpret what marriage is. I think it is ridiculous for someone like President Bush to try to decide what marriage is.\n\nI have read and heard that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain. It may be something people are born with, not something they develop because of their environment. This is different from being gay because of how they are raised.\n\nThe only reason I can think of to not allow gay marriage is that it may be seen as different. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately in Las Vegas. But if two gay people want to get married, it will be on the front page of the news. I think it should be a private matter, not a public one.",

If you talk about violence or bad things happening, people might react. You should not put that online.\n\nThe internet is for everyone to see.

            "I think the war has gone on for too long. I believe the purpose was good at first. We wanted to help another country have a democracy. But now, I think we're fighting just for the sake of fighting. It's like we want to prove we're a strong nation. I'm not sure the reasons for the war were fair. There were personal problems with the leader of Iraq. George Bush's father had conflicts with Saddam Hussein. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be good. But I don't think our reason for the war is fair now.\n\nI think we made our point in the first few months. The war was a statement. But it's been going on for many years. I think it's too long. If we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a dictator, that would be a good reason for the war. But I don't think that's our reason anymore. I think we're fighting just to fight.\n\nI think the war has lasted too long. The country we're fighting to help should now be able to govern itself. We're spending a lot of money on the war. We have problems at home, like poverty. We should be spending money on those problems. The war is also hurting our economy. There are other important things we should be spending money on, like public roads and schools. I think the money would be better spent on our own country's needs.\n\nWe're spending billions of dollars on the war. War shouldn't be a long-term expense. We have many problems at home that need to be solved. We should be spending money on things like healthcare, which is very important. Instead, we're spending money to kill our own citizens in a war we're losing.",
            "I have a question. Do you want me to clarify something?\n\nIt happened because someone looked online and found something. They went to a website called Myspace. When you put information on the internet, you must understand that many people can see it. On Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you accept someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your profile.\n\nAnytime you put information on the internet, you need to know that many people will see it. So, I think it's good that someone saw that information and was able to prevent a life from being lost.\n\nHowever, it's a problem if one person looks at everyone's profiles all the time. That is not fair. It's like looking at people and deciding who is good or bad. That's not right.\n\nI don't think it's right to have someone's job be to look at people's profiles. But it depends on why they looked at the profile. Were they looking for something specific or just looking at people's profiles randomly?\n\nI don't have a Myspace account, but I have a Facebook account. It worries me that there are people who can see things about me. I saw a show on TV about a man who wanted to prove how easy it is to get information about people. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name in less than a minute. He even talked to her on instant messenger.\n\nIt's hard because people you don't know can talk to you and know things about you. They can even see your photos and know where you are during the day. It's a problem because you think you're safe, but you're not.\n\nI try to limit what I put on Facebook, but I don't want to limit it too much. I want to be able to talk to my friends. It's a tricky issue because you never know who can see what.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I don't understand how the school officials had the right to tell students they couldn't have Myspace. That's a question of privacy.",
            "The Iraq War is a topic I do not like to discuss. I feel bad talking about it because many people already know my opinion. I was against the war from the start. But it is not important now because everyone agrees it was a bad idea except for the people in charge. They do not want to admit they were wrong.\n\nNew polls show that 75 to 80 percent of the world's population thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis and 70 percent of American soldiers in Iraq think the war was a bad idea. They think the United States should leave Iraq within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we went there. Now it is even worse. There is no easy way to solve the problem. The United States and the Middle East have different cultures. The United States wanted to bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq do not want it.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but was the war the best way to stop him? Before we went to war, we should have thought about the good and the bad. The war was like quicksand. We got stuck and now we are in trouble.\n\nI do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The government may have ideas about why we should stay, but I do not agree with them. If they say we can leave gradually over a year, I would not be opposed to that. But I do not see a reason why we should not leave now.\n\nIn fact, 80 percent of Iraqis think we should leave within a year. They are the people we are trying to help. If they tell us to leave, we should listen. If we leave, we can say we tried to help them. If something goes wrong, we can say they made the decision to leave.\n\nI do not think we will ever be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we will be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with unfair treatment of people because of their sex in the United States. Women have a harder time than men in many jobs. It is like a \"glass ceiling\" that makes it difficult for women to get ahead. Many people have difficulty accepting women in important positions. This is because of how society has taught them to think. \n\nIn some jobs, like business, it is rare to find a man working under a woman. People think women are not good leaders. But many women are very qualified for important jobs. They have the skills and knowledge to do the work. However, they may not be chosen for a position because of how things have been in the past. It is the same for men in some jobs, like fashion. They may not be taken seriously if they are not like other men who work in fashion. \n\nIf a man wants to stay at home to take care of his children, many people do not understand this. They think a man should work and earn money for the family. But some men want to stay home and take care of their children. This can be hard for them because people do not accept it. \n\nTo change this, we need to be patient. We have made progress, but it takes time. If we push too hard for change, people may resist. It is like a slow process. But we are moving forward. More women are getting important jobs and more men are staying home to care for their children. We need to show the good qualities of people who are often judged unfairly. We should not be too pushy, but we should show people that they are capable and qualified. \n\nWe also have to remember that people from different places and backgrounds may be judged unfairly. For example, someone who grew up on a farm may not have good grammar, but they may be very smart and capable. Other people may judge them because of their grammar. We need to respect and accept people for who they are, not for how they speak or where they come from.",
            "I think they did not make it a crime. \nThey made it less serious. \nIt is no longer a crime, but more like a traffic ticket. \nYou get a warning and do not go to jail. \nThis is good because people do not have to worry about getting in trouble for a long time. \nBut, some people are still concerned about the future. \nEven if it is not a crime, it can still make it hard to get a job. \nIt can still cause problems. \nBut, some people think it is a good idea to not spend so much money on arresting people and taking them to court. \nIt costs a lot to arrest, take to court, and keep someone in jail. \nSo, if a city is in trouble and does not have much money, they might not want to make it legal. \nHowever, some cities with more open-minded people think it is okay. \nThey can use the money they save to help other things, like schools and programs for the elderly. \nIt is a good idea because marijuana is not something we want on the streets. \nBut it is also about money and how we use our money. \nSome people think it should be sold like cigarettes, but that might be bad because people might smoke and drive. \nIt is still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. \nSo, it would be awkward to have it out in the open. \nAlcohol can hurt people's ability to drive, but marijuana can hurt people's lives in other ways. \nEvery person reacts differently to substances. \nSome people can handle them easily, but others cannot. \nIt makes it hard to say for sure how bad marijuana is.",
            "I say yes. \nBecause many things they do are very traditional. \nThey have done the same things for a long time. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be flexible and change. \n\nFor example, in the Catholic Church, many people must go to church every week. \nThey have strict rules for how things are done. \nSometimes I feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were from different religions. \nMy mom was Episcopalian and my dad was Episcopalian too. \nMy mom was a Catholic, but they could not get married in the Catholic Church because of my dad's religion. \n\nThe Catholic teaching is to love others. \nBut it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them. \nI think some Catholic teachings tell you to do things, but the practice of the Church goes against it. \nThis is because the practice is old-fashioned, but the Church continues to do it anyway. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop them from doing bad things. \nPeople who do bad things will keep doing them, no matter what. \nIt is not the same to be married as it is to have a child. \nSo, it is not likely that allowing priests to be married would prevent bad things from happening.",
            "I am not sure yet about this issue. It is very difficult to say if one side is right or wrong. The problem is between the separation of church and state and how to define marriage. This is a hard problem because it is very sensitive.\n\nI think a civil union is the same as marriage. It is a union between two people. The government should not look at the kind of marriage or if the people were baptized. Marriage is just two people together.\n\nIf all states agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But a constitutional amendment to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It is not big enough.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. I have some thoughts about homosexuality. It is a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle, but I think they should be allowed to make their own choices. I do not think the government should decide for everyone. \n\nDifferent states have different opinions. Some states are democratic and others are republican. If you live in a democratic state, you agree with their decisions. If you do not like the decision, you can move to a different state. I think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. They should be able to get married if a state allows it. \n\nI already said this, but I will say it again. I do not think President Bush should decide what all states can and cannot do. It is up to each state to decide for itself. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will not be in office forever. If a new president does not like his decision, they can change it. Each state should make its own decisions because they will live with the results. It is not the president's job to decide for everyone. \n\nDo I want a ban on gay marriage? No, I do not.",
            "I don't agree with what you said. Let me explain. Myspace is a public place where people can post things for others to see. If you post something on Myspace, you have to know that others will see it. That includes school officials.\n\nIn this case, the school officials checked Myspace to prevent a school shooting. I think that's okay. The school's responsibility is to keep students safe. If they can find something on Myspace that helps them do that, I think that's fine.\n\nSchool officials can look at Myspace to catch students breaking the rules. But I think that's an invasion of privacy. However, if they use Myspace to make the school a better and safer place, I don't think that's an invasion.\n\nIt's like when you post something on the internet. It's hard to control who sees it. I'm careful about what I post because I know it can come back to haunt me.\n\nIf you post something bad about someone on the internet, you can get in trouble. And once it's on the internet, it's there forever. School officials shouldn't go on the internet just to catch students, but if they find something that helps keep the school safe, I think that's okay.\n\nMy teacher told me that schools have to be careful. They have to make sure students are safe. We practiced what to do in case of an emergency. School officials were just trying to keep the school safe.\n\nThey were preventing something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were doing what they thought was best to keep students safe. That's their job.",
            "I think about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea. The attack on 9/11 affected me personally. I wanted to do something about it. I thought we should go to the country where the attack came from and cause some trouble. But I think we did not think about the long-term results. We went there without a clear plan. I believe this was a mistake. \n\nNow, I do not think the war was a good idea. The people in that country are fighting each other. They cannot fight with us too. I do not think our presence there will make a difference. They will continue to fight each other. \n\nBecause of 9/11, I have lost interest in what is happening in that country. I see the people there as not truly human. They fight and cannot work together. We should have thought before we went there. We did not know what to expect. The way they fight is different from how we fight. I think they want us to leave, not help them. \n\nI think we went there for revenge. President Bush wanted to go to war in Iraq. The people wanted revenge for 9/11. I understand why he did it, but I do not think it was the right decision. We could not just let Iraq do what it wanted and then expect us to rebuild it. \n\nWe did not have a clear plan for what to do in Iraq. We did not know what we were doing. We should have been more careful and thought more about the consequences. I do not think we can change the people in Iraq. They will always be like that. We cannot stay in Iraq forever. If we leave, the country will probably collapse. We are hurting ourselves by staying there. We should leave and stop fighting."
