            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. The church is losing followers, and this is partly because it is not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor example, the church has strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While these views are okay, they are a bit old-fashioned. If the church were to change its ideas to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nMany people do not agree with the church's views on these subjects. They see the church's opinions as wrong. The church is against abortion, and people who support abortion may not feel comfortable in a church that says it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage and other issues.\n\nI don't see why priests cannot be married or have women priests. The church says that priests are married to God, but I do not see why they cannot have a family and be devoted to both their job and their family.\n\nIt is hard to say if this would have prevented problems in the church. But it seems fair that priests should be able to have a family life like everyone else. They have a job, but they also have their own life. I do not see why they cannot be devoted to both God and their family.",

I haven't given the issue a lot of thought, but I think it is wrong.\n\nI believe that people cannot choose who they are attracted to. If someone is born straight, they are straight. If someone is born gay, they are gay. It is not a choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It is not a question of law or morality. It is just who people are. They should not be judged or punished for it.\n\nThe federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. This issue is not related to the security of our country. It is simply a matter of treating people with respect and kindness.\n\nPeople should be free to be who they are. We should not punish them for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason why it shouldn't be.\n\nMany people think that homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. They are a different kind of family, not the same as traditional families.\n\nThere are many rights that come with marriage, like property taxes and health care. If a gay couple gets married, their partner can be with them in the hospital and visit them when they are sick. This is a basic right.\n\nScience shows that gay couples are no different from straight couples. They have the same rates of success and the same factors that make a relationship happy.\n\nThe problem is that some people object to gay marriage because they don't want to allow it in their churches. But the government should not be involved in this. A marriage is a legal document, not a church ceremony.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, why not marriage? It's the same thing. It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their communities. But these are not good reasons. Every family is different, and gay families are no exception. They can be good parents just like straight couples.\n\nSome people say that children of gay parents will be hurt by their parents' choices. But there is no evidence for this. Children of gay parents can be happy and well-adjusted just like children of straight parents.\n\nThe government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should not interfere with this issue. The President has his own views, but they are based on his religion and not on what is fair and equal for all.\n\nIt's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of many Americans and impose one group's views on the rest. The government should not make laws based on one group's religious standards.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just our friends and neighbors.",

For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These medicines help people feel better. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is against the law, we are not using its good effects. \n\nSome people think that marijuana and alcohol are the same. But they are different. If you use too much marijuana or too much alcohol, you can have problems. I think it is not good to make marijuana legal all at once. We should remove the bad idea people have about marijuana first. Then, people might use it responsibly. \n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. It is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change our idea about marijuana, people might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I used to go to church every Sunday when I was young. I got dressed up in nice clothes and shoes. But now, they have a special service for teenagers that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They come in beach clothes. Even at morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I've seen is this. I don't know much about the church's government, but this is what I've noticed.\n\nRegarding the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think getting rid of men as priests or allowing them to marry would have stopped these problems. Some men who are married are still pedophiles. It's not because of the rules about marriage that they behave this way. When people choose to become priests, it's their choice. Some other religions allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to be married and follow their faith, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think being a pedophile is due to genetics. People are either born that way or they're not. It's not something that someone becomes because of their upbringing. I don't think the church could have prevented these problems, even if they had tried. If they knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "I am very unhappy about the way the United States went to war in Iraq.  After the September 11th attacks, the country was still in shock. The Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go to war in Iraq. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that was not true.\n\nThe administration lied to the American people. Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the United Nations. This is not acceptable. It is a serious mistake for government officials to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown no respect for the United States Constitution. They have tried to limit its power since September 11th. They wanted to go to war from the beginning.\n\nOne of the former government officials wrote that President Bush wanted to go to war because of a personal reason. He wanted to punish Saddam Hussein because his father was unhappy with him. The president also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has lasted too long. But if we leave now, there may be more violence and many more people will die. The United Nations and the United States are trying to find a way to end the war. They may ask other countries in the area to help restore order. However, this may cause more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government is not working well.

But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, it will take a long time to build a democracy. And when we leave, they will be angry with us.

They are in danger because of the different groups fighting each other. \n\nI am worried that if we stay, we will try to make Iraq like the United States. This will make things worse for them.

            "I do not think it is right for a state to make a law that is against what a person's church believes. This is because the United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state.

If the government does this, it will be against the Constitution. I don't think it is fair to pick one church's beliefs over another. For example, many Catholics and Christians do not agree with this thing. But some areas, like Boston, do agree.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been important in the United States for a long time. It has allowed people to practice their own religion freely. The government should not try to make an amendment to change this. It would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI also think this amendment would be the only one that would keep people from doing what they want. It would not limit the government, but the people. I don't think this is fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. The president wants to make a new law because of his own personal beliefs. But this would be unfair to other people who do not share his beliefs. The churches should decide what is right or wrong, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for this new law except for the president's personal views. It will not help the economy, and it might even make things better in society.\n\nI think I have said everything I want to say.",
            "The war in Iraq. The American government did not tell the people the truth about the reasons for the war. They said it was connected to the attacks on September 11th, but that was not true. The government used the people's anger to make them want to go to war. \n\nIn 2003, the US invaded Iraq. I do not believe in war. I think it is not right to make a preemptive attack. The US government should not have done this. \n\nThe war in Iraq is like the war in Vietnam. The US government should have learned from its mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the problems that would come after. They wanted to put a democratic government in its place. But this was difficult. The US should have known that it would be hard. \n\nThe US government should have planned for all the things that could happen after the war. They were not prepared. Many American soldiers are still in Iraq, and many are dying. The US is trying to train the Iraqi army and police to control their own country. This takes a long time. \n\nThe US government made the people think the war would be easy and short. But it is not easy to create a new government. It takes years. In the US, it took a long time to create a strong democracy. There was a lot of trouble and a civil war. \n\nThis decision to go to war in Iraq was hard. I was thinking about this in the 2004 election. I thought about voting for President Bush because he started the war, and it was hard to stop it. But then I thought, we cannot just leave the people of Iraq. We took their government and their way of life away. How can we leave them now? \n\nThe US is risking a lot of American lives to make a democratic Iraq. But I do not think it is right to risk so many lives just for oil. The US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. We know North Korea has these weapons, and we do not attack them. I do not think the US government is honest in its decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I do not think that will happen soon.",

Studies show that it may be caused by biology, not how we are raised.

They take care of their children and live normal lives.\n\nThe government should not try to decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try to change the definition of marriage. Many experts say that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain.

This is a problem I've dealt with as a Resident Advisor (R.A.). \n\nWhen you put something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. You cannot control what others think or say. \n\nThe internet is like a big public place. Many people see what you write. If you're friends with someone on a website like Myspace, you might see what they post. But the school can't control what you write. Someone might tell the school about a problem. They have to act on it.\n\nIt's hard to know what to believe because some people just joke around. But what happened was that someone overheard a conversation at school. They told the school about it. When they looked at a student's Facebook page, they found things that could be taken seriously. The student thought they were jokes, but they became serious.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have no control over who sees them. If you don't want people to know something, don't post it.

We may be fighting just to prove we are powerful.\n\nI do not think the reasons for starting the war were clear. Perhaps it was connected to a disagreement between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if personal issues were involved, it would not be good.\n\nI think we made our point in the beginning. But the war has gone on for many years. It's time to end it.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. But I don't think that's what we're doing now. It seems we are at war because we want to be at war.\n\nI think it's time to stop. The government of that country should take care of itself. We have our own problems, like poverty and bad roads, that we should be spending money on. We are spending billions of dollars on war when we could use that money to help our own people.\n\nWar is not something we should be doing in the long term. We have many problems at home that need our money. Our own citizens are fighting and dying in this war, and I don't think it's worth it.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Is it right to have someone look at students' online profiles to prevent a problem? \n\nWell, you see, if you post information on the internet, you can't really know who will see it. For example, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you accept someone as your friend, you're giving them permission to see your information.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, you have to understand that many people will see it. So, if someone found information that helped prevent a problem, I think that's good.\n\nHowever, it's a complicated issue. We can't have someone looking at everyone's online profiles all day to prevent problems. That would be like treating some students unfairly. They might look at the students who they think are more likely to cause trouble.\n\nBut, it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for a reason to worry, it's not right. They should not be looking at profiles just to find something to be worried about.\n\nI have a Facebook account. I know there are people who might see things about me that I don't want them to know. I saw a TV show about a man who showed how easily he could get information about someone online. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name in just a minute. He even tricked her into meeting with him.\n\nIt's hard to know who can see your online information. They might know your interests, what you look like, where you are, and who your friends are. They can even see pictures of you. I tried to limit what I post online, but it's hard to keep some things private.\n\nThe problem is that the internet is meant for communication, but it's not always private. So, it's a tricky issue.\n\nI heard that my roommate's school once had a rule against students having Myspace accounts. I didn't think that was right. How can school officials tell students what they can and can't do online? It's a complicated issue that I'm not really sure about.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It is a difficult thing to talk about. I feel bad saying what I am about to say. I was against the war from the beginning. I don't want to join the group of people who say \"I was against it from the start.\" But now, it's not important anymore. Everyone agrees it was a bad idea. The government does not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nIf we look at the polls, we can see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. This includes 80 percent of Iraqis and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq. They think we should leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the start. It was a disaster before we entered Iraq. Now, pulling out will also be a disaster. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. The United States and the Middle East have different cultures. This makes it hard for us to understand each other.\n\nWe thought we could bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not how the people of Iraq wanted to live. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nWe should listen to the Iraqis and leave. They want us to go. If we listen to them, we will not be responsible if things get worse. We can still help Iraq after we leave. This way, we will not be seen as the bad guys in the Middle East.\n\nWe should leave Iraq now. We can leave gradually over a year or a little longer if we want. I just don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and some want us to leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to go. They might know better than us.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if we should leave, and they say yes, then we are not responsible if things get worse. We can be the good guys again. We will never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not only women who face this issue, but also people in certain jobs or industries.\n\nIt is hard for women to be in high positions because of the \"glass ceiling\". This means that even if they are qualified, they may not be chosen for a job. This is because people are used to men being in charge.\n\nNot only women, but also men face this problem. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think, \"How can you know about fashion if you're a man?\" They may not understand that men can also be interested in fashion.\n\nIt is also a problem for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children. People may think, \"You're a man, you should be working.\" This can be hard for men who want to spend time with their families.\n\nTo change this, it takes time. We have made progress, but it is slow. We need to keep working to make society understand that men and women are equal. As more women become successful in business and men stay home to care for their children, society is starting to accept these changes.\n\nWe should not force change, but instead show people the good qualities of those who are often discriminated against. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We need to find a balance and let change happen naturally.\n\nAnother problem is that people from different places may be discriminated against. For example, someone from a farm may not speak well, but they are very intelligent and can be a good leader. Other people may look down on them because of the way they speak.\n\nSo, to sum up, gender discrimination is a big problem in the United States. It affects both men and women in different ways. We need to keep working to make society understand that everyone is equal.",
            "I think they did not make marijuana legal. \nThey made it not a crime. \nIt used to be a crime, but now it's not as serious. \nYou can get a ticket for it instead of being arrested and put in jail. \nThis means you do not have to go through all the trouble and expense of an arrest and court case. \nBut even if you get a ticket, it can still affect you in the future. \nFor example, it can affect how people see you when you try to get a job. \nBut some people think that making marijuana not a crime saves money. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and put people in jail. \nThen the government has to pay for the court case and lawyers. \nIf a community is short of money, they might not want to make marijuana not a crime. \nBut in Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it's okay to make marijuana not a crime. \nThis means they have more money to spend on things like education and helping the homeless. \nI think this is a good idea. \nMarijuana is not something we want to be everywhere. \nBut making it not a crime helps the community financially. \nOther reasons we might not want marijuana to be everywhere are that people might smoke it and drive. \nSome people think it is still wrong to smoke marijuana. \nThey do not want it to be out in the open. \nI think it would be awkward for many people if marijuana was sold in stores like cigarettes. \nAlcohol can be bad for people's ability to drive and make decisions. \nMarijuana can also be bad for people's lifestyles. \nBut different people react to substances in different ways. \nSome people can handle them well, and some people cannot. \nSo it is hard to say how marijuana will affect people. \nI think both marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. \nBut people can use them in different ways.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things in the Catholic Church are old ways of doing things. \nThey have done things in the same way for a long time. \nThis is good, because tradition is important. \nBut it is also important to change sometimes. \n\nI think many Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not a Catholic. \n\nI think this is not very tolerant. \nWe learned to love others in the Catholic Church. \nThis is a good teaching. \nBut it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them. \n\nI do not think that making priests able to get married would make a difference. \nI think some people who do bad things, like hurting children, would do that anyway. \nIt is not the same as having a spouse. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop bad things from happening. \nI think these things would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a clear opinion. Both sides have good and bad points. But this is a very difficult problem. It is hard to decide what is right and what is wrong. \n\nSomething important is the idea of separating church and state. And defining marriage is hard to do without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know what to think. \n\nI think governments should look at civil unions. A civil union is when two people agree to be together. This is what marriage is. It is two people who want to be together. Governments should not ask if their marriage is a \"sacrament\" or not. They should not ask about their church. \n\nIf two people are married, they should have the same rights. They should not be treated differently because of who they are. \n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married. What is important is that they are happy and love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on this issue, it should be made into a law for the whole country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not necessary. This is a small issue. It does not need to be in the constitution.\n\nThis is a simple idea. Marriage is between two people who love each other. It is not about what the government says.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states are more likely to approve gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept the state's decision.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, it should be up to each state to decide if they want to legalize gay marriage. I do not agree with the ban on gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for all states. President Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left up to each state. He will be out of office in a few years. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It is better to leave it up to each state. They will have to live with their decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think that.",
            "I don't agree with the idea of the school officials going on the internet to search for students. Myspace is a public website where people can post messages for others to see. If a student posts something on Myspace, it's like posting a sign on their wall for everyone to see.\n\nThe school officials have the right to know if students are doing things that can hurt themselves or others. If they see something that can help them keep the school safe, that's okay. They want to make sure students are safe, just like parents do.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, people can see it, including school officials. They can even find old posts from years ago. This is why I think it's okay for school officials to check the internet for things that can help them keep the school safe.\n\nIf school officials check the internet to see if students are doing bad things, it's not an invasion of privacy. They are trying to make the school a better and safer place for everyone. This is like what teachers and police do when they check the internet to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nI think it's a good idea for school officials to check the internet to make sure the school is safe. They can prevent things like school shootings from happening. This is what they did in this case, and it's a good thing.\n\nI'm not saying they should just go on the internet to catch students. But if it helps keep the school safe, that's okay. School officials are like the parents of the school. They want to keep everyone safe.\n\nI'm not worried about what I post on the internet. If I say something bad about someone, I wouldn't say it on the internet. But if I do, it's not a big deal. It's like putting a sign on your wall for everyone to see.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to keep the school safe, like they do during drills for emergencies. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like the Columbine school shooting.\n\nThat's my opinion.",
            "I have changed my mind about the war. At first, I was for it. I was affected by 9/11 and wanted to help. But I think we made a mistake. We went to war without a plan, and it did not work. We did not think about the long-term effects.\n\nNow I am against the war. I do not think it helped anything. The people in the country we were fighting could not fight with each other, so why should we be there? We went there to help, but we only created more problems.\n\nI do not care about what happens in that country. I think they are using war as a way to get rid of us, not to make their country better. I think we should leave and let them handle their own problems.\n\nWe were not prepared for war. We did not know what we were getting into. War is different for them than it is for us. They fight with no rules, and they are not trying to make their country better. We went to war seeking revenge, not thinking about the consequences.\n\nI think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it. He made a decision, but it was not a good one. We should have had a plan before we went in.\n\nWe did not have unity in our plan. We did not know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve. We created more problems instead of solving them. I do not think we can change the people in that country. They will always be like that.\n\nI do not think we are making progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay in the country. If we leave, the country will fall apart. We are hurting ourselves by staying there. We cannot stay forever, so it is time to go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. The church is losing followers, and this is partly because it is not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor example, the church has strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While these views are okay, they are a bit old-fashioned. If the church were to change its ideas to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nMany people do not agree with the church's views on these subjects. They see the church's opinions as wrong. The church is against abortion, and people who support abortion may not feel comfortable in a church that says it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage and other issues.\n\nI don't see why priests cannot be married or have women priests. The church says that priests are married to God, but I do not see why they cannot have a family and be devoted to both their job and their family.\n\nIt is hard to say if this would have prevented problems in the church. But it seems fair that priests should be able to have a family life like everyone else. They have a job, but they also have their own life. I do not see why they cannot be devoted to both God and their family.",

I haven't given the issue a lot of thought, but I think it is wrong.\n\nI believe that people cannot choose who they are attracted to. If someone is born straight, they are straight. If someone is born gay, they are gay. It is not a choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It is not a question of law or morality. It is just who people are. They should not be judged or punished for it.\n\nThe federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. This issue is not related to the security of our country. It is simply a matter of treating people with respect and kindness.\n\nPeople should be free to be who they are. We should not punish them for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason why it shouldn't be.\n\nMany people think that homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. They are a different kind of family, not the same as traditional families.\n\nThere are many rights that come with marriage, like property taxes and health care. If a gay couple gets married, their partner can be with them in the hospital and visit them when they are sick. This is a basic right.\n\nScience shows that gay couples are no different from straight couples. They have the same rates of success and the same factors that make a relationship happy.\n\nThe problem is that some people object to gay marriage because they don't want to allow it in their churches. But the government should not be involved in this. A marriage is a legal document, not a church ceremony.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, why not marriage? It's the same thing. It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their communities. But these are not good reasons. Every family is different, and gay families are no exception. They can be good parents just like straight couples.\n\nSome people say that children of gay parents will be hurt by their parents' choices. But there is no evidence for this. Children of gay parents can be happy and well-adjusted just like children of straight parents.\n\nThe government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should not interfere with this issue. The President has his own views, but they are based on his religion and not on what is fair and equal for all.\n\nIt's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of many Americans and impose one group's views on the rest. The government should not make laws based on one group's religious standards.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just our friends and neighbors.",

For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These medicines help people feel better. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is against the law, we are not using its good effects. \n\nSome people think that marijuana and alcohol are the same. But they are different. If you use too much marijuana or too much alcohol, you can have problems. I think it is not good to make marijuana legal all at once. We should remove the bad idea people have about marijuana first. Then, people might use it responsibly. \n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. It is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change our idea about marijuana, people might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I used to go to church every Sunday when I was young. I got dressed up in nice clothes and shoes. But now, they have a special service for teenagers that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They come in beach clothes. Even at morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I've seen is this. I don't know much about the church's government, but this is what I've noticed.\n\nRegarding the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think getting rid of men as priests or allowing them to marry would have stopped these problems. Some men who are married are still pedophiles. It's not because of the rules about marriage that they behave this way. When people choose to become priests, it's their choice. Some other religions allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to be married and follow their faith, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think being a pedophile is due to genetics. People are either born that way or they're not. It's not something that someone becomes because of their upbringing. I don't think the church could have prevented these problems, even if they had tried. If they knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "I am very unhappy about the way the United States went to war in Iraq.  After the September 11th attacks, the country was still in shock. The Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go to war in Iraq. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that was not true.\n\nThe administration lied to the American people. Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the United Nations. This is not acceptable. It is a serious mistake for government officials to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown no respect for the United States Constitution. They have tried to limit its power since September 11th. They wanted to go to war from the beginning.\n\nOne of the former government officials wrote that President Bush wanted to go to war because of a personal reason. He wanted to punish Saddam Hussein because his father was unhappy with him. The president also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has lasted too long. But if we leave now, there may be more violence and many more people will die. The United Nations and the United States are trying to find a way to end the war. They may ask other countries in the area to help restore order. However, this may cause more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government is not working well.

But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, it will take a long time to build a democracy. And when we leave, they will be angry with us.

They are in danger because of the different groups fighting each other. \n\nI am worried that if we stay, we will try to make Iraq like the United States. This will make things worse for them.

            "I do not think it is right for a state to make a law that is against what a person's church believes. This is because the United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state.

If the government does this, it will be against the Constitution. I don't think it is fair to pick one church's beliefs over another. For example, many Catholics and Christians do not agree with this thing. But some areas, like Boston, do agree.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been important in the United States for a long time. It has allowed people to practice their own religion freely. The government should not try to make an amendment to change this. It would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI also think this amendment would be the only one that would keep people from doing what they want. It would not limit the government, but the people. I don't think this is fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. The president wants to make a new law because of his own personal beliefs. But this would be unfair to other people who do not share his beliefs. The churches should decide what is right or wrong, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for this new law except for the president's personal views. It will not help the economy, and it might even make things better in society.\n\nI think I have said everything I want to say.",
            "The war in Iraq. The American government did not tell the people the truth about the reasons for the war. They said it was connected to the attacks on September 11th, but that was not true. The government used the people's anger to make them want to go to war. \n\nIn 2003, the US invaded Iraq. I do not believe in war. I think it is not right to make a preemptive attack. The US government should not have done this. \n\nThe war in Iraq is like the war in Vietnam. The US government should have learned from its mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the problems that would come after. They wanted to put a democratic government in its place. But this was difficult. The US should have known that it would be hard. \n\nThe US government should have planned for all the things that could happen after the war. They were not prepared. Many American soldiers are still in Iraq, and many are dying. The US is trying to train the Iraqi army and police to control their own country. This takes a long time. \n\nThe US government made the people think the war would be easy and short. But it is not easy to create a new government. It takes years. In the US, it took a long time to create a strong democracy. There was a lot of trouble and a civil war. \n\nThis decision to go to war in Iraq was hard. I was thinking about this in the 2004 election. I thought about voting for President Bush because he started the war, and it was hard to stop it. But then I thought, we cannot just leave the people of Iraq. We took their government and their way of life away. How can we leave them now? \n\nThe US is risking a lot of American lives to make a democratic Iraq. But I do not think it is right to risk so many lives just for oil. The US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. We know North Korea has these weapons, and we do not attack them. I do not think the US government is honest in its decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I do not think that will happen soon.",

Studies show that it may be caused by biology, not how we are raised.

They take care of their children and live normal lives.\n\nThe government should not try to decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try to change the definition of marriage. Many experts say that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain.

This is a problem I've dealt with as a Resident Advisor (R.A.). \n\nWhen you put something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. You cannot control what others think or say. \n\nThe internet is like a big public place. Many people see what you write. If you're friends with someone on a website like Myspace, you might see what they post. But the school can't control what you write. Someone might tell the school about a problem. They have to act on it.\n\nIt's hard to know what to believe because some people just joke around. But what happened was that someone overheard a conversation at school. They told the school about it. When they looked at a student's Facebook page, they found things that could be taken seriously. The student thought they were jokes, but they became serious.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have no control over who sees them. If you don't want people to know something, don't post it.

We may be fighting just to prove we are powerful.\n\nI do not think the reasons for starting the war were clear. Perhaps it was connected to a disagreement between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if personal issues were involved, it would not be good.\n\nI think we made our point in the beginning. But the war has gone on for many years. It's time to end it.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. But I don't think that's what we're doing now. It seems we are at war because we want to be at war.\n\nI think it's time to stop. The government of that country should take care of itself. We have our own problems, like poverty and bad roads, that we should be spending money on. We are spending billions of dollars on war when we could use that money to help our own people.\n\nWar is not something we should be doing in the long term. We have many problems at home that need our money. Our own citizens are fighting and dying in this war, and I don't think it's worth it.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Is it right to have someone look at students' online profiles to prevent a problem? \n\nWell, you see, if you post information on the internet, you can't really know who will see it. For example, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you accept someone as your friend, you're giving them permission to see your information.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, you have to understand that many people will see it. So, if someone found information that helped prevent a problem, I think that's good.\n\nHowever, it's a complicated issue. We can't have someone looking at everyone's online profiles all day to prevent problems. That would be like treating some students unfairly. They might look at the students who they think are more likely to cause trouble.\n\nBut, it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for a reason to worry, it's not right. They should not be looking at profiles just to find something to be worried about.\n\nI have a Facebook account. I know there are people who might see things about me that I don't want them to know. I saw a TV show about a man who showed how easily he could get information about someone online. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name in just a minute. He even tricked her into meeting with him.\n\nIt's hard to know who can see your online information. They might know your interests, what you look like, where you are, and who your friends are. They can even see pictures of you. I tried to limit what I post online, but it's hard to keep some things private.\n\nThe problem is that the internet is meant for communication, but it's not always private. So, it's a tricky issue.\n\nI heard that my roommate's school once had a rule against students having Myspace accounts. I didn't think that was right. How can school officials tell students what they can and can't do online? It's a complicated issue that I'm not really sure about.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It is a difficult thing to talk about. I feel bad saying what I am about to say. I was against the war from the beginning. I don't want to join the group of people who say \"I was against it from the start.\" But now, it's not important anymore. Everyone agrees it was a bad idea. The government does not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nIf we look at the polls, we can see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. This includes 80 percent of Iraqis and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq. They think we should leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the start. It was a disaster before we entered Iraq. Now, pulling out will also be a disaster. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. The United States and the Middle East have different cultures. This makes it hard for us to understand each other.\n\nWe thought we could bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not how the people of Iraq wanted to live. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nWe should listen to the Iraqis and leave. They want us to go. If we listen to them, we will not be responsible if things get worse. We can still help Iraq after we leave. This way, we will not be seen as the bad guys in the Middle East.\n\nWe should leave Iraq now. We can leave gradually over a year or a little longer if we want. I just don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and some want us to leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to go. They might know better than us.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if we should leave, and they say yes, then we are not responsible if things get worse. We can be the good guys again. We will never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not only women who face this issue, but also people in certain jobs or industries.\n\nIt is hard for women to be in high positions because of the \"glass ceiling\". This means that even if they are qualified, they may not be chosen for a job. This is because people are used to men being in charge.\n\nNot only women, but also men face this problem. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think, \"How can you know about fashion if you're a man?\" They may not understand that men can also be interested in fashion.\n\nIt is also a problem for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children. People may think, \"You're a man, you should be working.\" This can be hard for men who want to spend time with their families.\n\nTo change this, it takes time. We have made progress, but it is slow. We need to keep working to make society understand that men and women are equal. As more women become successful in business and men stay home to care for their children, society is starting to accept these changes.\n\nWe should not force change, but instead show people the good qualities of those who are often discriminated against. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We need to find a balance and let change happen naturally.\n\nAnother problem is that people from different places may be discriminated against. For example, someone from a farm may not speak well, but they are very intelligent and can be a good leader. Other people may look down on them because of the way they speak.\n\nSo, to sum up, gender discrimination is a big problem in the United States. It affects both men and women in different ways. We need to keep working to make society understand that everyone is equal.",
            "I think they did not make marijuana legal. \nThey made it not a crime. \nIt used to be a crime, but now it's not as serious. \nYou can get a ticket for it instead of being arrested and put in jail. \nThis means you do not have to go through all the trouble and expense of an arrest and court case. \nBut even if you get a ticket, it can still affect you in the future. \nFor example, it can affect how people see you when you try to get a job. \nBut some people think that making marijuana not a crime saves money. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and put people in jail. \nThen the government has to pay for the court case and lawyers. \nIf a community is short of money, they might not want to make marijuana not a crime. \nBut in Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it's okay to make marijuana not a crime. \nThis means they have more money to spend on things like education and helping the homeless. \nI think this is a good idea. \nMarijuana is not something we want to be everywhere. \nBut making it not a crime helps the community financially. \nOther reasons we might not want marijuana to be everywhere are that people might smoke it and drive. \nSome people think it is still wrong to smoke marijuana. \nThey do not want it to be out in the open. \nI think it would be awkward for many people if marijuana was sold in stores like cigarettes. \nAlcohol can be bad for people's ability to drive and make decisions. \nMarijuana can also be bad for people's lifestyles. \nBut different people react to substances in different ways. \nSome people can handle them well, and some people cannot. \nSo it is hard to say how marijuana will affect people. \nI think both marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. \nBut people can use them in different ways.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things in the Catholic Church are old ways of doing things. \nThey have done things in the same way for a long time. \nThis is good, because tradition is important. \nBut it is also important to change sometimes. \n\nI think many Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not a Catholic. \n\nI think this is not very tolerant. \nWe learned to love others in the Catholic Church. \nThis is a good teaching. \nBut it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them. \n\nI do not think that making priests able to get married would make a difference. \nI think some people who do bad things, like hurting children, would do that anyway. \nIt is not the same as having a spouse. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop bad things from happening. \nI think these things would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a clear opinion. Both sides have good and bad points. But this is a very difficult problem. It is hard to decide what is right and what is wrong. \n\nSomething important is the idea of separating church and state. And defining marriage is hard to do without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know what to think. \n\nI think governments should look at civil unions. A civil union is when two people agree to be together. This is what marriage is. It is two people who want to be together. Governments should not ask if their marriage is a \"sacrament\" or not. They should not ask about their church. \n\nIf two people are married, they should have the same rights. They should not be treated differently because of who they are. \n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married. What is important is that they are happy and love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on this issue, it should be made into a law for the whole country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not necessary. This is a small issue. It does not need to be in the constitution.\n\nThis is a simple idea. Marriage is between two people who love each other. It is not about what the government says.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states are more likely to approve gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept the state's decision.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, it should be up to each state to decide if they want to legalize gay marriage. I do not agree with the ban on gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for all states. President Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left up to each state. He will be out of office in a few years. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It is better to leave it up to each state. They will have to live with their decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think that.",
            "I don't agree with the idea of the school officials going on the internet to search for students. Myspace is a public website where people can post messages for others to see. If a student posts something on Myspace, it's like posting a sign on their wall for everyone to see.\n\nThe school officials have the right to know if students are doing things that can hurt themselves or others. If they see something that can help them keep the school safe, that's okay. They want to make sure students are safe, just like parents do.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, people can see it, including school officials. They can even find old posts from years ago. This is why I think it's okay for school officials to check the internet for things that can help them keep the school safe.\n\nIf school officials check the internet to see if students are doing bad things, it's not an invasion of privacy. They are trying to make the school a better and safer place for everyone. This is like what teachers and police do when they check the internet to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nI think it's a good idea for school officials to check the internet to make sure the school is safe. They can prevent things like school shootings from happening. This is what they did in this case, and it's a good thing.\n\nI'm not saying they should just go on the internet to catch students. But if it helps keep the school safe, that's okay. School officials are like the parents of the school. They want to keep everyone safe.\n\nI'm not worried about what I post on the internet. If I say something bad about someone, I wouldn't say it on the internet. But if I do, it's not a big deal. It's like putting a sign on your wall for everyone to see.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to keep the school safe, like they do during drills for emergencies. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like the Columbine school shooting.\n\nThat's my opinion.",
            "I have changed my mind about the war. At first, I was for it. I was affected by 9/11 and wanted to help. But I think we made a mistake. We went to war without a plan, and it did not work. We did not think about the long-term effects.\n\nNow I am against the war. I do not think it helped anything. The people in the country we were fighting could not fight with each other, so why should we be there? We went there to help, but we only created more problems.\n\nI do not care about what happens in that country. I think they are using war as a way to get rid of us, not to make their country better. I think we should leave and let them handle their own problems.\n\nWe were not prepared for war. We did not know what we were getting into. War is different for them than it is for us. They fight with no rules, and they are not trying to make their country better. We went to war seeking revenge, not thinking about the consequences.\n\nI think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it. He made a decision, but it was not a good one. We should have had a plan before we went in.\n\nWe did not have unity in our plan. We did not know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve. We created more problems instead of solving them. I do not think we can change the people in that country. They will always be like that.\n\nI do not think we are making progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay in the country. If we leave, the country will fall apart. We are hurting ourselves by staying there. We cannot stay forever, so it is time to go."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. The church is losing followers, and this is partly because it is not very accepting of many things. \n\nFor example, the church has strong views on topics like gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. While these views are okay, they are a bit old-fashioned. If the church were to change its ideas to be more modern, it would not lose so many followers.\n\nMany people do not agree with the church's views on these subjects. They see the church's opinions as wrong. The church is against abortion, and people who support abortion may not feel comfortable in a church that says it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage and other issues.\n\nI don't see why priests cannot be married or have women priests. The church says that priests are married to God, but I do not see why they cannot have a family and be devoted to both their job and their family.\n\nIt is hard to say if this would have prevented problems in the church. But it seems fair that priests should be able to have a family life like everyone else. They have a job, but they also have their own life. I do not see why they cannot be devoted to both God and their family.",

I haven't given the issue a lot of thought, but I think it is wrong.\n\nI believe that people cannot choose who they are attracted to. If someone is born straight, they are straight. If someone is born gay, they are gay. It is not a choice.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It is not a question of law or morality. It is just who people are. They should not be judged or punished for it.\n\nThe federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. This issue is not related to the security of our country. It is simply a matter of treating people with respect and kindness.\n\nPeople should be free to be who they are. We should not punish them for that.",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized. There is no good reason why it shouldn't be.\n\nMany people think that homosexual couples are a threat to the traditional family. But this is not true. They are a different kind of family, not the same as traditional families.\n\nThere are many rights that come with marriage, like property taxes and health care. If a gay couple gets married, their partner can be with them in the hospital and visit them when they are sick. This is a basic right.\n\nScience shows that gay couples are no different from straight couples. They have the same rates of success and the same factors that make a relationship happy.\n\nThe problem is that some people object to gay marriage because they don't want to allow it in their churches. But the government should not be involved in this. A marriage is a legal document, not a church ceremony.\n\nIf the government allows civil unions, why not marriage? It's the same thing. It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nPeople worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their communities. But these are not good reasons. Every family is different, and gay families are no exception. They can be good parents just like straight couples.\n\nSome people say that children of gay parents will be hurt by their parents' choices. But there is no evidence for this. Children of gay parents can be happy and well-adjusted just like children of straight parents.\n\nThe government should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should not interfere with this issue. The President has his own views, but they are based on his religion and not on what is fair and equal for all.\n\nIt's not fair to ignore the culture and morality of many Americans and impose one group's views on the rest. The government should not make laws based on one group's religious standards.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are psychologically damaged. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just our friends and neighbors.",

For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocets. These medicines help people feel better. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is against the law, we are not using its good effects. \n\nSome people think that marijuana and alcohol are the same. But they are different. If you use too much marijuana or too much alcohol, you can have problems. I think it is not good to make marijuana legal all at once. We should remove the bad idea people have about marijuana first. Then, people might use it responsibly. \n\nPeople have a bad idea about marijuana because it is against the law. It is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change our idea about marijuana, people might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It's not as strict as it used to be. I used to go to church every Sunday when I was young. I got dressed up in nice clothes and shoes. But now, they have a special service for teenagers that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They come in beach clothes. Even at morning services, people wear jeans and khakis. The church has become more casual.\n\nThe biggest change I've seen is this. I don't know much about the church's government, but this is what I've noticed.\n\nRegarding the problems with Catholic priests and pedophilia, I don't think getting rid of men as priests or allowing them to marry would have stopped these problems. Some men who are married are still pedophiles. It's not because of the rules about marriage that they behave this way. When people choose to become priests, it's their choice. Some other religions allow their leaders to be married. If someone wants to be married and follow their faith, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think being a pedophile is due to genetics. People are either born that way or they're not. It's not something that someone becomes because of their upbringing. I don't think the church could have prevented these problems, even if they had tried. If they knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that's wrong. But I don't think they always knew.",
            "I am very unhappy about the way the United States went to war in Iraq.  After the September 11th attacks, the country was still in shock. The Bush administration used the attacks as an excuse to go to war in Iraq. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but that was not true.\n\nThe administration lied to the American people. Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the United Nations. This is not acceptable. It is a serious mistake for government officials to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration has shown no respect for the United States Constitution. They have tried to limit its power since September 11th. They wanted to go to war from the beginning.\n\nOne of the former government officials wrote that President Bush wanted to go to war because of a personal reason. He wanted to punish Saddam Hussein because his father was unhappy with him. The president also wanted to control Iraq's oil.\n\nI think the war has lasted too long. But if we leave now, there may be more violence and many more people will die. The United Nations and the United States are trying to find a way to end the war. They may ask other countries in the area to help restore order. However, this may cause more problems in the long run.\n\nThe Iraqi government is not working well.

But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, it will take a long time to build a democracy. And when we leave, they will be angry with us.

They are in danger because of the different groups fighting each other. \n\nI am worried that if we stay, we will try to make Iraq like the United States. This will make things worse for them.

            "I do not think it is right for a state to make a law that is against what a person's church believes. This is because the United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state.

If the government does this, it will be against the Constitution. I don't think it is fair to pick one church's beliefs over another. For example, many Catholics and Christians do not agree with this thing. But some areas, like Boston, do agree.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been important in the United States for a long time. It has allowed people to practice their own religion freely. The government should not try to make an amendment to change this. It would be wrong and go against what is already written in the Constitution.\n\nI also think this amendment would be the only one that would keep people from doing what they want. It would not limit the government, but the people. I don't think this is fair.\n\nI don't think the federal government should be involved in this issue. The president wants to make a new law because of his own personal beliefs. But this would be unfair to other people who do not share his beliefs. The churches should decide what is right or wrong, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for this new law except for the president's personal views. It will not help the economy, and it might even make things better in society.\n\nI think I have said everything I want to say.",
            "The war in Iraq. The American government did not tell the people the truth about the reasons for the war. They said it was connected to the attacks on September 11th, but that was not true. The government used the people's anger to make them want to go to war. \n\nIn 2003, the US invaded Iraq. I do not believe in war. I think it is not right to make a preemptive attack. The US government should not have done this. \n\nThe war in Iraq is like the war in Vietnam. The US government should have learned from its mistakes. Many American soldiers died in the war. The US removed the Iraqi government without being prepared for the problems that would come after. They wanted to put a democratic government in its place. But this was difficult. The US should have known that it would be hard. \n\nThe US government should have planned for all the things that could happen after the war. They were not prepared. Many American soldiers are still in Iraq, and many are dying. The US is trying to train the Iraqi army and police to control their own country. This takes a long time. \n\nThe US government made the people think the war would be easy and short. But it is not easy to create a new government. It takes years. In the US, it took a long time to create a strong democracy. There was a lot of trouble and a civil war. \n\nThis decision to go to war in Iraq was hard. I was thinking about this in the 2004 election. I thought about voting for President Bush because he started the war, and it was hard to stop it. But then I thought, we cannot just leave the people of Iraq. We took their government and their way of life away. How can we leave them now? \n\nThe US is risking a lot of American lives to make a democratic Iraq. But I do not think it is right to risk so many lives just for oil. The US government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. We know North Korea has these weapons, and we do not attack them. I do not think the US government is honest in its decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I do not think that will happen soon.",

Studies show that it may be caused by biology, not how we are raised.

They take care of their children and live normal lives.\n\nThe government should not try to decide what marriage means. I think it's ridiculous for politicians to try to change the definition of marriage. Many experts say that being gay may be caused by a chemical in the brain.

This is a problem I've dealt with as a Resident Advisor (R.A.). \n\nWhen you put something online, it can affect how people think of you. If you talk about violence or shootings, people will react. You cannot control what others think or say. \n\nThe internet is like a big public place. Many people see what you write. If you're friends with someone on a website like Myspace, you might see what they post. But the school can't control what you write. Someone might tell the school about a problem. They have to act on it.\n\nIt's hard to know what to believe because some people just joke around. But what happened was that someone overheard a conversation at school. They told the school about it. When they looked at a student's Facebook page, they found things that could be taken seriously. The student thought they were jokes, but they became serious.\n\nWhen you post things online, you have no control over who sees them. If you don't want people to know something, don't post it.

We may be fighting just to prove we are powerful.\n\nI do not think the reasons for starting the war were clear. Perhaps it was connected to a disagreement between George Bush's father and Saddam Hussein. If the goal was to give democracy to a country without a fair system, that would be a good reason. But if personal issues were involved, it would not be good.\n\nI think we made our point in the beginning. But the war has gone on for many years. It's time to end it.\n\nIf we wanted to give democracy to a country ruled by a tyrant, that would be a good reason for war. But I don't think that's what we're doing now. It seems we are at war because we want to be at war.\n\nI think it's time to stop. The government of that country should take care of itself. We have our own problems, like poverty and bad roads, that we should be spending money on. We are spending billions of dollars on war when we could use that money to help our own people.\n\nWar is not something we should be doing in the long term. We have many problems at home that need our money. Our own citizens are fighting and dying in this war, and I don't think it's worth it.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. Is it right to have someone look at students' online profiles to prevent a problem? \n\nWell, you see, if you post information on the internet, you can't really know who will see it. For example, on Myspace, you have to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you accept someone as your friend, you're giving them permission to see your information.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, you have to understand that many people will see it. So, if someone found information that helped prevent a problem, I think that's good.\n\nHowever, it's a complicated issue. We can't have someone looking at everyone's online profiles all day to prevent problems. That would be like treating some students unfairly. They might look at the students who they think are more likely to cause trouble.\n\nBut, it depends on the situation. If someone was looking for a reason to worry, it's not right. They should not be looking at profiles just to find something to be worried about.\n\nI have a Facebook account. I know there are people who might see things about me that I don't want them to know. I saw a TV show about a man who showed how easily he could get information about someone online. He went onto a girl's profile and got her screen name in just a minute. He even tricked her into meeting with him.\n\nIt's hard to know who can see your online information. They might know your interests, what you look like, where you are, and who your friends are. They can even see pictures of you. I tried to limit what I post online, but it's hard to keep some things private.\n\nThe problem is that the internet is meant for communication, but it's not always private. So, it's a tricky issue.\n\nI heard that my roommate's school once had a rule against students having Myspace accounts. I didn't think that was right. How can school officials tell students what they can and can't do online? It's a complicated issue that I'm not really sure about.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It is a difficult thing to talk about. I feel bad saying what I am about to say. I was against the war from the beginning. I don't want to join the group of people who say \"I was against it from the start.\" But now, it's not important anymore. Everyone agrees it was a bad idea. The government does not want to admit they made a mistake.\n\nIf we look at the polls, we can see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. This includes 80 percent of Iraqis and 70 percent of U.S. troops in Iraq. They think we should leave within a year.\n\nThe war has been a disaster since the start. It was a disaster before we entered Iraq. Now, pulling out will also be a disaster. There is no easy way to deal with the Middle East. The United States and the Middle East have different cultures. This makes it hard for us to understand each other.\n\nWe thought we could bring democracy to Iraq, but this is not how the people of Iraq wanted to live. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the pros and cons before invading Iraq.\n\nWe should listen to the Iraqis and leave. They want us to go. If we listen to them, we will not be responsible if things get worse. We can still help Iraq after we leave. This way, we will not be seen as the bad guys in the Middle East.\n\nWe should leave Iraq now. We can leave gradually over a year or a little longer if we want. I just don't see a reason to stay any longer. Most Iraqis want us to leave within a year, and some want us to leave now. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to go. They might know better than us.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if we should leave, and they say yes, then we are not responsible if things get worse. We can be the good guys again. We will never be the good guys in the Middle East, but at least we will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think gender discrimination is still a problem in the United States. It is not only women who face this issue, but also people in certain jobs or industries.\n\nIt is hard for women to be in high positions because of the \"glass ceiling\". This means that even if they are qualified, they may not be chosen for a job. This is because people are used to men being in charge.\n\nNot only women, but also men face this problem. For example, in the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think, \"How can you know about fashion if you're a man?\" They may not understand that men can also be interested in fashion.\n\nIt is also a problem for men who want to stay at home and take care of their children. People may think, \"You're a man, you should be working.\" This can be hard for men who want to spend time with their families.\n\nTo change this, it takes time. We have made progress, but it is slow. We need to keep working to make society understand that men and women are equal. As more women become successful in business and men stay home to care for their children, society is starting to accept these changes.\n\nWe should not force change, but instead show people the good qualities of those who are often discriminated against. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We need to find a balance and let change happen naturally.\n\nAnother problem is that people from different places may be discriminated against. For example, someone from a farm may not speak well, but they are very intelligent and can be a good leader. Other people may look down on them because of the way they speak.\n\nSo, to sum up, gender discrimination is a big problem in the United States. It affects both men and women in different ways. We need to keep working to make society understand that everyone is equal.",
            "I think they did not make marijuana legal. \nThey made it not a crime. \nIt used to be a crime, but now it's not as serious. \nYou can get a ticket for it instead of being arrested and put in jail. \nThis means you do not have to go through all the trouble and expense of an arrest and court case. \nBut even if you get a ticket, it can still affect you in the future. \nFor example, it can affect how people see you when you try to get a job. \nBut some people think that making marijuana not a crime saves money. \nIt costs a lot to arrest and put people in jail. \nThen the government has to pay for the court case and lawyers. \nIf a community is short of money, they might not want to make marijuana not a crime. \nBut in Denver, people are more open-minded. \nThey think it's okay to make marijuana not a crime. \nThis means they have more money to spend on things like education and helping the homeless. \nI think this is a good idea. \nMarijuana is not something we want to be everywhere. \nBut making it not a crime helps the community financially. \nOther reasons we might not want marijuana to be everywhere are that people might smoke it and drive. \nSome people think it is still wrong to smoke marijuana. \nThey do not want it to be out in the open. \nI think it would be awkward for many people if marijuana was sold in stores like cigarettes. \nAlcohol can be bad for people's ability to drive and make decisions. \nMarijuana can also be bad for people's lifestyles. \nBut different people react to substances in different ways. \nSome people can handle them well, and some people cannot. \nSo it is hard to say how marijuana will affect people. \nI think both marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. \nBut people can use them in different ways.",
            "I think yes. \nBecause \nMany things in the Catholic Church are old ways of doing things. \nThey have done things in the same way for a long time. \nThis is good, because tradition is important. \nBut it is also important to change sometimes. \n\nI think many Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes I think the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not a Catholic. \n\nI think this is not very tolerant. \nWe learned to love others in the Catholic Church. \nThis is a good teaching. \nBut it is not fair to say to love others and then not accept them. \n\nI do not think that making priests able to get married would make a difference. \nI think some people who do bad things, like hurting children, would do that anyway. \nIt is not the same as having a spouse. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to be married would stop bad things from happening. \nI think these things would happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I do not have a clear opinion. Both sides have good and bad points. But this is a very difficult problem. It is hard to decide what is right and what is wrong. \n\nSomething important is the idea of separating church and state. And defining marriage is hard to do without hurting anyone's feelings. I do not know what to think. \n\nI think governments should look at civil unions. A civil union is when two people agree to be together. This is what marriage is. It is two people who want to be together. Governments should not ask if their marriage is a \"sacrament\" or not. They should not ask about their church. \n\nIf two people are married, they should have the same rights. They should not be treated differently because of who they are. \n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married. What is important is that they are happy and love each other.\n\nIf all states can agree on this issue, it should be made into a law for the whole country. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not necessary. This is a small issue. It does not need to be in the constitution.\n\nThis is a simple idea. Marriage is between two people who love each other. It is not about what the government says.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. But I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. It is not a national issue. Each state should decide.\n\nSome states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states are more likely to approve gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you know how the state feels about this issue. I do not think you can disagree with the state's decision if it legalizes gay marriage. You chose to live there, so you should accept the state's decision.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, it should be up to each state to decide if they want to legalize gay marriage. I do not agree with the ban on gay marriage.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for all states. President Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state runs itself. Some things should be left up to each state. He will be out of office in a few years. A new president may decide to lift the ban. It is better to leave it up to each state. They will have to live with their decision, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not think that.",
            "I don't agree with the idea of the school officials going on the internet to search for students. Myspace is a public website where people can post messages for others to see. If a student posts something on Myspace, it's like posting a sign on their wall for everyone to see.\n\nThe school officials have the right to know if students are doing things that can hurt themselves or others. If they see something that can help them keep the school safe, that's okay. They want to make sure students are safe, just like parents do.\n\nWhen you post something on the internet, people can see it, including school officials. They can even find old posts from years ago. This is why I think it's okay for school officials to check the internet for things that can help them keep the school safe.\n\nIf school officials check the internet to see if students are doing bad things, it's not an invasion of privacy. They are trying to make the school a better and safer place for everyone. This is like what teachers and police do when they check the internet to prevent bad things from happening.\n\nI think it's a good idea for school officials to check the internet to make sure the school is safe. They can prevent things like school shootings from happening. This is what they did in this case, and it's a good thing.\n\nI'm not saying they should just go on the internet to catch students. But if it helps keep the school safe, that's okay. School officials are like the parents of the school. They want to keep everyone safe.\n\nI'm not worried about what I post on the internet. If I say something bad about someone, I wouldn't say it on the internet. But if I do, it's not a big deal. It's like putting a sign on your wall for everyone to see.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to keep the school safe, like they do during drills for emergencies. They want to prevent bad things from happening, like the Columbine school shooting.\n\nThat's my opinion.",
            "I have changed my mind about the war. At first, I was for it. I was affected by 9/11 and wanted to help. But I think we made a mistake. We went to war without a plan, and it did not work. We did not think about the long-term effects.\n\nNow I am against the war. I do not think it helped anything. The people in the country we were fighting could not fight with each other, so why should we be there? We went there to help, but we only created more problems.\n\nI do not care about what happens in that country. I think they are using war as a way to get rid of us, not to make their country better. I think we should leave and let them handle their own problems.\n\nWe were not prepared for war. We did not know what we were getting into. War is different for them than it is for us. They fight with no rules, and they are not trying to make their country better. We went to war seeking revenge, not thinking about the consequences.\n\nI think President Bush declared war on Iraq because the people wanted it. He made a decision, but it was not a good one. We should have had a plan before we went in.\n\nWe did not have unity in our plan. We did not know what we were doing or what we wanted to achieve. We created more problems instead of solving them. I do not think we can change the people in that country. They will always be like that.\n\nI do not think we are making progress. We have made some progress, but not enough to stay in the country. If we leave, the country will fall apart. We are hurting ourselves by staying there. We cannot stay forever, so it is time to go."
