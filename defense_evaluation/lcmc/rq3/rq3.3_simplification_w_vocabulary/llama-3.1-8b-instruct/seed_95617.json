            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

For example, gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these subjects, but its views are old-fashioned in some ways.\n\nIf the Church changes its thinking, it will not lose its followers. Some people disagree with the Church on these issues. They do not like the Church's views. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married. Many people do not think this is fair. They think priests should be able to have families like other people. The Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too.\n\nI do not think it is fair for priests to be different from everyone else. They should be able to have both a job and a family. This would make the Church more accepting and fair.",

This is not fair.\n\nPeople are born gay. They are not born straight. It is not a choice.

            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Many people think gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that's not true. It's different, but it's not the same.\n\nGay couples have the right to the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to visit each other in the hospital and make decisions about each other's care. It's not fair to call them anything less than family.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are like other couples in many ways. They have the same chance of a happy and successful relationship. They just want a marriage certificate, not a church wedding.\n\nIf we separate church and state, there's no reason to deny gay couples the same rights as everyone else. It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their community. But kids from gay parents are the same as kids from straight parents. They need love and support, not a certain kind of family.\n\nPeople worry about how kids will turn out, but it's not fair to blame a child's parents for their choices. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.\n\nI think the government should help make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment to ban it is unfair. President Bush's views on this are based on his own morals, but morality can be different from person to person.\n\nSome people believe gay people are damaged or have a personality problem, but that's not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not popular opinion.\n\nIf we listen to people who know, we might see things differently. We should treat everyone equal, regardless of their orientation.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I want to say something about marijuana. Just because a drug is illegal does not mean it has good qualities. I think it is not good to make marijuana available to the public. But I do think it can be good for medical use. If a drug is illegal, it does not mean it has no good qualities. I think people should be able to use its good qualities.\n\nThere are some medicines that are illegal, but doctors use them. For example, oxycotton, Vicodin, and Perocets. They are controlled medicines, but they are good for people. If we do not use marijuana because it is taboo, that is not fair. We should look at its good qualities.\n\nMarijuana is different from alcohol. If you use too much marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you use too much alcohol, it can also cause problems. It is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but slowly. If we make it legal all at once, people might use it too much. But if we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, people might use it for medical reasons.",
            "The church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends.\n\nThe church now has a special service for teenagers. It lasts only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes or jeans and khakis. In the past, people dressed up for church. Now it is more casual.\n\nI do not know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change I see is how people dress.\n\nThe church has been accused of problems with priests and pedophilia. I do not think allowing priests to marry or allowing female priests would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. It is the person, not the marriage or the job, that causes the problem.\n\nPeople choose to become priests. If they want to be married, they should choose a different religion. There are religions that allow priests to be married. \n\nI think pedophilia is a genetic problem. People are born with it. It is not something they become. Genetics play a big role in it. The church cannot stop people from being born with these tendencies.\n\nIf the church knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The US went to war in Iraq for many reasons. Some people think that the Bush administration used the war as a reason to take action. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this has been proven wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration told the American people that Iraq was connected to the September 11th attacks. They said Saddam Hussein was like Osama Bin Laden. But this was a lie.\n\nThis makes me very upset. Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not sure about the evidence. He was unsure even when he was presenting it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is very wrong. The Bush administration should have told the truth to the American people. This is a serious mistake. It is against the law for a president to lie.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They tried to make it less important. They wanted to go to war.\n\nOne of the former Treasury Secretaries said that President Bush wanted to go to war because of a personal reason. He wanted to avenge his father's failed war with Iraq.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be more violence and people could die. The US and the United Nations are trying to find a solution. They want to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help restore order.\n\nBut I am not sure this is a good idea.

            "I have thoughts about the War in Iraq. I feel it is not a good idea. The war was not officially declared by the U.S. government. I think we went to war because of the September 11 attacks. Iraq was blamed for the attacks. I am not very informed about the war. But I know that our goal is to help Iraq build a democracy. We also want to control their oil. However, I think this is not a good reason to stay in Iraq. The war makes many people unhappy. If we stay in Iraq, we will have to make them like us. This will take a long time. If we leave, they will be angry with us. They will have to start all over. I am not sure what to think.\n\nI think the war should continue, but we should not call it a war anymore. We only use guns to show that we are strong. I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. The war was not officially declared by Congress. This is important. Congress must declare a war before it starts. I do not think it is fair to stay in Iraq. We are wasting our resources. I also feel bad for President Bush. He is making a bad decision. It is like the Vietnam War. That war was not officially declared either. It was called a meaningless war. Now, President Bush is being called a bad president for starting this war. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end because it is hurting them. But I also do not want to leave them behind. They have lives too. However, if we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture. This will make things worse. The Al-Kaida group will get stronger and they will hate us more.

            "I do not think a government should make something legal or not.  I think this is a decision for churches to make. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is stated very clearly in the Constitution. If a government tries to make a law about it, they would be going against the Constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make something illegal are choosing which church's beliefs are right and which are wrong. Many Catholics and Christians do not support it. But I do not think the government can tell churches what to do. The government's job is to protect people's freedom to believe what they want.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a key part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom in the United States. If we had an amendment about this, it would be against what is already in the Constitution. It would also be one of the only amendments that helps the government, not the people. I do not think this is right.\n\nI do not believe the government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment is because of his own personal feelings. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. I think it is up to the churches to decide what is right or wrong, not the government.\n\nI do not see how this amendment will help the country. It may even make things better.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the US government was not honest with Americans about why we went to war. They said we went to war because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. But the two things are not closely connected. The government made the American people believe this, using their anger towards the terrorists. In 2003, the US invaded Iraq.\n\nI am against war, especially a surprise attack. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in Iraq. This is sad. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but it did not prepare for the problems that would come after. There was chaos and a power vacuum. Now the US is trying to put a democracy in Iraq, but it is a difficult process.\n\nIn the past, the US tried to do the same thing in Vietnam. They wanted to remove the Communists and put a democracy in place. But it did not work well. It was a long and hard process. The US government should have known this.\n\nIf the US is going to go to war, it must be prepared for all outcomes. The government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq. Many American soldiers are still dying, and the Iraqi troops are still learning how to police their own country. It takes time to build a new government.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people. They made it seem like the war would be easy and short. But it is not that simple. Democracy is not easy to create. In the US, it took a long time to build our democracy.\n\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004. I wanted to give President Bush a chance to finish what he started. But now, it's hard to leave Iraq. The US took away their government and way of life. We can't just leave now.\n\nHowever, we must also think about the many American casualties. How many lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq? The reason we invaded Iraq was to make it a democracy, but why not do the same in other countries? I think the real reason is the oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nBefore the war, the US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Why did the US not attack North Korea, which actually had those weapons? I don't think the US government is honest or thorough in its decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I don't think that will happen soon.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage.  I have always been.  I think it is a personal preference.  Recently, science has shown that it may be biological, not caused by society.  This makes it unfair for people to be treated differently because of something they cannot control.  I believe it is inhumane.\n\nI think politics and government should not interfere with personal matters.  Marriage is a personal choice, not a government issue.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because of the law.  But they live like any other family.  They walk their dogs and do other normal things.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush and others who try to define marriage in their own way.  I think this is ridiculous.\n\nI have read and heard that some people may be born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay.  This is different from growing up in a certain way.  So, it may not be a choice.\n\nThe main problem is that marriage is a private matter.  If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it secretly.  But if two people of the same sex want to get married, it is a big public issue.  I think marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it becomes public. It can be seen by everyone. You cannot control what people think about you later. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I have already dealt with this issue. When you put something on the internet, it can affect people's opinions of you. If you talk about bad things, like violence or shootings, people will talk about it. You cannot control what they say.\n\nThe internet is public. If you have friends on Myspace or Facebook, they can see your messages. The school administration must take notice of these messages. They cannot ignore them. If they do, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nBut, some people just joke around on the internet. It can be hard to know what is serious and what is not. In our school, something like this happened. A student was overheard saying something, and someone reported it to the school. We found out who said it and looked at their Facebook page. They had posted some things that might seem funny, but were not funny in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it is not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think or take seriously. School officials should not be friends with their students on the internet. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a teacher should not make a fake Facebook account to friend their students. That is not right. I wouldn't want to be friends with my residents on the internet, either. I don't want to know about their private lives. If they post things on Facebook, that's not my problem.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. I think the purpose of the war was good at first. It was to help another country have a fair government. But now, I think we are fighting mainly to show we are a strong country. I do not think this is a good reason.\n\nI think the original motivation was to help a country with no fair government. If there were other reasons, I do not think it was a good idea. I think we made our point in the first few months. But the war has gone on for many years. I think it is too long.\n\nI think our purpose has changed over time. I think we started the war to help a country, but now we are fighting just to fight. We do not want to leave without winning. \n\nI think the war should end now. The country's government will have to help itself soon. I think this time has come. We are spending a lot of money on the war. We have problems in our own country, like poverty and poor schools. We should spend our money on these things.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. War should not be a long-term expense. We have other problems that need our money, like health care and public roads. Our own citizens are getting hurt in the war. I think this money could be spent better.\n\nI think that is all I want to say.",
            "I have a question. You were not allowed to [REWRITE: participate in an activity] because someone looked at your personal information on the internet. They found it on Myspace. Myspace is a website where people can share information about themselves. If you want to see someone's information on Myspace, you must be a friend with them. This means you have agreed to let them see your information too.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, many people can see it. This is something you should understand. \n\nI think it's good that someone found that information and was able to stop something bad from happening.\n\nBut it's not fair to watch everyone's information all the time. It's not fair to pick on some people and not others. And it's not right to have someone's job be to look at everyone's information.\n\nI don't have a Myspace, but I have Facebook. It bothers me that people can see things about me. I saw a show on TV that showed how easy it is for people to get information from the internet. They can even find out personal things like your school schedule.\n\nOn Facebook, people can see your photos and your friends. They can even find out where you are during the day. But the point of Facebook is to communicate with friends. I don't want to limit what I put up, but it's hard because you never know who can see it.\n\nI only accept friends I know, but I still worry about who can see my information. My roommate told me that her high school banned students from having Myspace. I think that's strange. I don't know if the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. I was against it from the start, but now it's not as important. Everyone agrees it was a bad idea, except the people in the government who made the decision. They do not want to admit their mistake.\n\nPolls show that 75 to 80% of people around the world think the war was a bad idea. This is true in Iraq, where 80% of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 70% of the US soldiers in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and that we should leave in a year.\n\nThe war was already a problem before we went in. Now, leaving is also a problem. It's hard to know what to do in the Middle East. We have a big difference in culture between the US and Middle Eastern countries. The US thought it could bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq would have made different choices.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the pros and cons before going to war. The war has made things worse. We should leave Iraq now.\n\nI don't see a reason to stay in Iraq. The US government has ideas about why we should stay, but I do not agree. I think it's better to leave now. Many Iraqis want us to leave, and we should listen to them.\n\nIf we ask Iraqis what to do, they want us to leave. They know their country better than we do. If we leave and things get worse, we can say, \"We did what you asked us to do.\" We can help Iraq after we leave, but we will not be heroes in the Middle East. We can at least say we tried to do the right thing.",
            "I think there is still a problem with different treatment of men and women in the United States. This is not just for women, but also for men in some jobs. Many people have a hard time working below a woman because of how society has been since a long time ago. \n\nWomen often see a job they can do and have good qualifications for it, but the group in charge does not choose them for the job because historically, women do not usually work in high positions. The same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a parent at home. People often look down on men who stay home to take care of children because society thinks they should be working to make money.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. People may think that men who like fashion do not know what fashion is for women. \n\nSociety has a set way of thinking, but it is changing slowly. Women are doing better in their jobs and becoming leaders. Men are also staying home to take care of their children and people are starting to accept this. If we continue working at this pace, I think the problem will be solved. We need to show the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against, but we should not force it. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We have made a lot of progress and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against because of where they are from. If someone from a farm goes to a high position in a company, others might look down on them because of their accent. This is another example of how people can be discriminated against.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is no longer a crime. It has been made legal by law. They changed it from a crime to a traffic ticket. When you get caught with marijuana, you get a ticket, not arrested or punished. This is good for people who have jobs. It is bad to have a drug charge because it affects your future. But if it is not a crime, it is better.\n\nSome people think it is not good to make marijuana legal because it costs a lot to arrest and punish people. They think it is better to use that money for important things like education, help for the elderly, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nIn some cities, people do not want marijuana to be legal because they do not agree with it. But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea to make money from it to help the city.\n\nI do not think marijuana should be everywhere like cigarettes. It is still not accepted in some places. If it is sold openly, it might be bad. Some people think it is not good to smoke and drive. They also think it is not good for people's lifestyles.\n\nAlcohol is bad for people's driving skills. Marijuana can be bad for people's behavior. Both substances have bad effects. But people react differently to them. Some people can use them and be fine, but some people cannot.\n\nI think both substances are bad for people. We should not generalize about them because people are different. We should think about the bad effects and decide what is best.",
            "I agree with this idea. \nBecause \nMany things in the Catholic Church are old customs. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt's good to have these traditions. \nBut it's also important to adapt to change. \nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes, the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nMy mom was an Episcopalian. \nMy dad was an Episcopalian. \nMy mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to others. \nWe always learn to love others in the Catholic Church. \nBut it's not kind to say love others and not accept them. \nSo, I think some Catholic teachings are good. \nBut the way the church acts is not always the same. \nIt's old-fashioned and they do not change. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop them from hurting children. \nThose people will do bad things no matter what. \nA child is not the same as a spouse. \nThey will do bad things if they want to. \n\nFor example, people who hurt children will do that anyway. \nIt's not because they are married or not married. \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I have thought about this issue, but I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is hard to say if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. The relationship between church and state is a problem. And defining marriage is also hard. It is hard to make a decision without hurting someone's feelings. I do not know what to think.\n\nI think that all civil unions are the same. Marriage is not just a government decision. It is a personal choice. People get tax breaks and special treatment if they are married. This is not fair if it only happens to some people. If two people want to be together, they should be able to. It is not up to the government to decide what kind of marriage it is.\n\nSome people want to allow gay marriage. This means two people of the same sex can be married. I think this is fair. They can have a civil union like anyone else.\n\nIf all states can agree on this, it should become a national law. But changing the constitution to say gay marriage is bad is not a good idea. The constitution is for big important issues, not for small ones.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution to say gay marriage is not allowed. This is just a simple issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think many states are Democratic or Republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, it should be up to each state whether or not to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said that. I do not think the president should decide what each state can or cannot do. The president is not in every state, so he should not make decisions for all states.\n\nI think some things should be left to the individual states. The president will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision because they will live with it.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I don't think the school officials acted wrong. Myspace is a public place on the internet. If you post something there, you know it's for everyone to see. School officials can see it even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it from home.\n\nIf they see something that could stop a school shooting, they have the right to see it. They have a responsibility to keep students safe. If they go on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, that's okay. They want to keep the school safe and good.\n\nBut if they go on just to get students in trouble, that's not okay. I think it's an invasion of privacy. However, if they can make the school a safer place, I don't think it's a problem.\n\nIt's easy to say things on the internet, but you never know who will see them. If you say something bad about someone, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something on the internet, it's always there. If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.\n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy. School officials are trying to keep the school safe. If they see something that can help, they should see it.\n\nI don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they see something that can make the school safer, that's okay. If they go on the internet to help keep students safe, it's not a problem.\n\nThey were just trying to keep the school safe. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening. They were trying to stop something like the Columbine school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help stop the people who did it. I thought we should go over there and make them stop fighting with each other. But I was not prepared for the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake by going to war without a clear plan. We just went in without thinking about the problems we might face. War is different for them than it is for us. They think about war in a way that is very different from how we think about it. They want to fight for their country, but I don't think they want to make their country better.\n\nWe went to war for revenge, and because the people wanted to go. President Bush thought it was the right thing to do. But I think he should have thought more carefully about the consequences. We couldn't just let them go on hurting people, but we should have had a better plan to help them.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They will always be like that. We are not the right people to change them. I think we are just causing problems for ourselves by staying there. We are wasting our time and resources. We can't stay in their country forever. Once we leave, things will fall apart again. We are not making enough progress, and it's time to go home."

studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

For example, gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these subjects, but its views are old-fashioned in some ways.\n\nIf the Church changes its thinking, it will not lose its followers. Some people disagree with the Church on these issues. They do not like the Church's views. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married. Many people do not think this is fair. They think priests should be able to have families like other people. The Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too.\n\nI do not think it is fair for priests to be different from everyone else. They should be able to have both a job and a family. This would make the Church more accepting and fair.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I believe people are born with their sexual orientation. They do not choose it. It is not something they can control. \n\nGay people should not be blamed for being gay. They should not be treated unfairly because of who they are. \n\nIt is not right to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. This is not fair.\n\nPeople are born gay. They are not born straight. It is not a choice. They should not be punished for being gay.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. Marriage is not a matter for the government. It is a personal thing. \n\nThe government should not tell people they are wrong for being gay. They should not punish them for being who they are. \n\nThe government should not interfere in people's lives. They should not decide who people can love and marry. \n\nPeople should be free to love who they want and get married if they want. The government should not stop them.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Many people think gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that's not true. It's different, but it's not the same.\n\nGay couples have the right to the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to visit each other in the hospital and make decisions about each other's care. It's not fair to call them anything less than family.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are like other couples in many ways. They have the same chance of a happy and successful relationship. They just want a marriage certificate, not a church wedding.\n\nIf we separate church and state, there's no reason to deny gay couples the same rights as everyone else. It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their community. But kids from gay parents are the same as kids from straight parents. They need love and support, not a certain kind of family.\n\nPeople worry about how kids will turn out, but it's not fair to blame a child's parents for their choices. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.\n\nI think the government should help make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment to ban it is unfair. President Bush's views on this are based on his own morals, but morality can be different from person to person.\n\nSome people believe gay people are damaged or have a personality problem, but that's not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not popular opinion.\n\nIf we listen to people who know, we might see things differently. We should treat everyone equal, regardless of their orientation.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I want to say something about marijuana. Just because a drug is illegal does not mean it has good qualities. I think it is not good to make marijuana available to the public. But I do think it can be good for medical use. If a drug is illegal, it does not mean it has no good qualities. I think people should be able to use its good qualities.\n\nThere are some medicines that are illegal, but doctors use them. For example, oxycotton, Vicodin, and Perocets. They are controlled medicines, but they are good for people. If we do not use marijuana because it is taboo, that is not fair. We should look at its good qualities.\n\nMarijuana is different from alcohol. If you use too much marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you use too much alcohol, it can also cause problems. It is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but slowly. If we make it legal all at once, people might use it too much. But if we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, people might use it for medical reasons.",
            "The church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends.\n\nThe church now has a special service for teenagers. It lasts only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes or jeans and khakis. In the past, people dressed up for church. Now it is more casual.\n\nI do not know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change I see is how people dress.\n\nThe church has been accused of problems with priests and pedophilia. I do not think allowing priests to marry or allowing female priests would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. It is the person, not the marriage or the job, that causes the problem.\n\nPeople choose to become priests. If they want to be married, they should choose a different religion. There are religions that allow priests to be married. \n\nI think pedophilia is a genetic problem. People are born with it. It is not something they become. Genetics play a big role in it. The church cannot stop people from being born with these tendencies.\n\nIf the church knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The US went to war in Iraq for many reasons. Some people think that the Bush administration used the war as a reason to take action. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this has been proven wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration told the American people that Iraq was connected to the September 11th attacks. They said Saddam Hussein was like Osama Bin Laden. But this was a lie.\n\nThis makes me very upset. Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not sure about the evidence. He was unsure even when he was presenting it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is very wrong. The Bush administration should have told the truth to the American people. This is a serious mistake. It is against the law for a president to lie.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They tried to make it less important. They wanted to go to war.\n\nOne of the former Treasury Secretaries said that President Bush wanted to go to war because of a personal reason. He wanted to avenge his father's failed war with Iraq.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be more violence and people could die. The US and the United Nations are trying to find a solution. They want to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help restore order.\n\nBut I am not sure this is a good idea. It could make more problems in the long run. Iraq's government is weak. The parliament is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have much control.

            "I have thoughts about the War in Iraq. I feel it is not a good idea. The war was not officially declared by the U.S. government. I think we went to war because of the September 11 attacks. Iraq was blamed for the attacks. I am not very informed about the war. But I know that our goal is to help Iraq build a democracy. We also want to control their oil. However, I think this is not a good reason to stay in Iraq. The war makes many people unhappy. If we stay in Iraq, we will have to make them like us. This will take a long time. If we leave, they will be angry with us. They will have to start all over. I am not sure what to think.\n\nI think the war should continue, but we should not call it a war anymore. We only use guns to show that we are strong. I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. The war was not officially declared by Congress. This is important. Congress must declare a war before it starts. I do not think it is fair to stay in Iraq. We are wasting our resources. I also feel bad for President Bush. He is making a bad decision. It is like the Vietnam War. That war was not officially declared either. It was called a meaningless war. Now, President Bush is being called a bad president for starting this war. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end because it is hurting them. But I also do not want to leave them behind. They have lives too. However, if we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture. This will make things worse. The Al-Kaida group will get stronger and they will hate us more. I think the war will last for a long time.",
            "I do not think a government should make something legal or not.  I think this is a decision for churches to make. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is stated very clearly in the Constitution. If a government tries to make a law about it, they would be going against the Constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make something illegal are choosing which church's beliefs are right and which are wrong. Many Catholics and Christians do not support it. But I do not think the government can tell churches what to do. The government's job is to protect people's freedom to believe what they want.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a key part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom in the United States. If we had an amendment about this, it would be against what is already in the Constitution. It would also be one of the only amendments that helps the government, not the people. I do not think this is right.\n\nI do not believe the government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment is because of his own personal feelings. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. I think it is up to the churches to decide what is right or wrong, not the government.\n\nI do not see how this amendment will help the country. It may even make things better.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the US government was not honest with Americans about why we went to war. They said we went to war because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. But the two things are not closely connected. The government made the American people believe this, using their anger towards the terrorists. In 2003, the US invaded Iraq.\n\nI am against war, especially a surprise attack. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in Iraq. This is sad. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but it did not prepare for the problems that would come after. There was chaos and a power vacuum. Now the US is trying to put a democracy in Iraq, but it is a difficult process.\n\nIn the past, the US tried to do the same thing in Vietnam. They wanted to remove the Communists and put a democracy in place. But it did not work well. It was a long and hard process. The US government should have known this.\n\nIf the US is going to go to war, it must be prepared for all outcomes. The government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq. Many American soldiers are still dying, and the Iraqi troops are still learning how to police their own country. It takes time to build a new government.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people. They made it seem like the war would be easy and short. But it is not that simple. Democracy is not easy to create. In the US, it took a long time to build our democracy.\n\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004. I wanted to give President Bush a chance to finish what he started. But now, it's hard to leave Iraq. The US took away their government and way of life. We can't just leave now.\n\nHowever, we must also think about the many American casualties. How many lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq? The reason we invaded Iraq was to make it a democracy, but why not do the same in other countries? I think the real reason is the oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nBefore the war, the US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Why did the US not attack North Korea, which actually had those weapons? I don't think the US government is honest or thorough in its decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I don't think that will happen soon.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage.  I have always been.  I think it is a personal preference.  Recently, science has shown that it may be biological, not caused by society.  This makes it unfair for people to be treated differently because of something they cannot control.  I believe it is inhumane.\n\nI think politics and government should not interfere with personal matters.  Marriage is a personal choice, not a government issue.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because of the law.  But they live like any other family.  They walk their dogs and do other normal things.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush and others who try to define marriage in their own way.  I think this is ridiculous.\n\nI have read and heard that some people may be born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay.  This is different from growing up in a certain way.  So, it may not be a choice.\n\nThe main problem is that marriage is a private matter.  If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it secretly.  But if two people of the same sex want to get married, it is a big public issue.  I think marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that.",

You cannot control what people think about you later. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I have already dealt with this issue. When you put something on the internet, it can affect people's opinions of you. If you talk about bad things, like violence or shootings, people will talk about it. You cannot control what they say.\n\nThe internet is public. If you have friends on Myspace or Facebook, they can see your messages. The school administration must take notice of these messages. They cannot ignore them. If they do, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nBut, some people just joke around on the internet. It can be hard to know what is serious and what is not. In our school, something like this happened. A student was overheard saying something, and someone reported it to the school. We found out who said it and looked at their Facebook page. They had posted some things that might seem funny, but were not funny in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it is not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think or take seriously. School officials should not be friends with their students on the internet. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a teacher should not make a fake Facebook account to friend their students. That is not right. I wouldn't want to be friends with my residents on the internet, either. I don't want to know about their private lives. If they post things on Facebook, that's not my problem.",

Myspace is a website where people can share information about themselves. If you want to see someone's information on Myspace, you must be a friend with them.

They do not want to admit their mistake.\n\nPolls show that 75 to 80% of people around the world think the war was a bad idea. This is true in Iraq, where 80% of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 70% of the US soldiers in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and that we should leave in a year.\n\nThe war was already a problem before we went in. Now, leaving is also a problem. It's hard to know what to do in the Middle East. We have a big difference in culture between the US and Middle Eastern countries. The US thought it could bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq would have made different choices.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the pros and cons before going to war. The war has made things worse. We should leave Iraq now.\n\nI don't see a reason to stay in Iraq. The US government has ideas about why we should stay, but I do not agree. I think it's better to leave now. Many Iraqis want us to leave, and we should listen to them.\n\nIf we ask Iraqis what to do, they want us to leave. They know their country better than we do. If we leave and things get worse, we can say, \"We did what you asked us to do.\" We can help Iraq after we leave, but we will not be heroes in the Middle East. We can at least say we tried to do the right thing.",
            "I think there is still a problem with different treatment of men and women in the United States. This is not just for women, but also for men in some jobs. Many people have a hard time working below a woman because of how society has been since a long time ago. \n\nWomen often see a job they can do and have good qualifications for it, but the group in charge does not choose them for the job because historically, women do not usually work in high positions. The same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a parent at home. People often look down on men who stay home to take care of children because society thinks they should be working to make money.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. People may think that men who like fashion do not know what fashion is for women. \n\nSociety has a set way of thinking, but it is changing slowly. Women are doing better in their jobs and becoming leaders. Men are also staying home to take care of their children and people are starting to accept this. If we continue working at this pace, I think the problem will be solved. We need to show the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against, but we should not force it. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We have made a lot of progress and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against because of where they are from. If someone from a farm goes to a high position in a company, others might look down on them because of their accent. This is another example of how people can be discriminated against.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is no longer a crime. It has been made legal by law. They changed it from a crime to a traffic ticket. When you get caught with marijuana, you get a ticket, not arrested or punished. This is good for people who have jobs. It is bad to have a drug charge because it affects your future. But if it is not a crime, it is better.\n\nSome people think it is not good to make marijuana legal because it costs a lot to arrest and punish people. They think it is better to use that money for important things like education, help for the elderly, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nIn some cities, people do not want marijuana to be legal because they do not agree with it. But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea to make money from it to help the city.\n\nI do not think marijuana should be everywhere like cigarettes. It is still not accepted in some places. If it is sold openly, it might be bad. Some people think it is not good to smoke and drive. They also think it is not good for people's lifestyles.\n\nAlcohol is bad for people's driving skills. Marijuana can be bad for people's behavior. Both substances have bad effects. But people react differently to them. Some people can use them and be fine, but some people cannot.\n\nI think both substances are bad for people. We should not generalize about them because people are different. We should think about the bad effects and decide what is best.",
            "I agree with this idea. \nBecause \nMany things in the Catholic Church are old customs. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt's good to have these traditions. \nBut it's also important to adapt to change. \nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes, the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nMy mom was an Episcopalian. \nMy dad was an Episcopalian. \nMy mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to others. \nWe always learn to love others in the Catholic Church. \nBut it's not kind to say love others and not accept them. \nSo, I think some Catholic teachings are good. \nBut the way the church acts is not always the same. \nIt's old-fashioned and they do not change. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop them from hurting children. \nThose people will do bad things no matter what. \nA child is not the same as a spouse. \nThey will do bad things if they want to. \n\nFor example, people who hurt children will do that anyway. \nIt's not because they are married or not married. \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I have thought about this issue, but I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is hard to say if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. The relationship between church and state is a problem. And defining marriage is also hard. It is hard to make a decision without hurting someone's feelings. I do not know what to think.\n\nI think that all civil unions are the same. Marriage is not just a government decision. It is a personal choice. People get tax breaks and special treatment if they are married. This is not fair if it only happens to some people. If two people want to be together, they should be able to. It is not up to the government to decide what kind of marriage it is.\n\nSome people want to allow gay marriage. This means two people of the same sex can be married. I think this is fair. They can have a civil union like anyone else.\n\nIf all states can agree on this, it should become a national law. But changing the constitution to say gay marriage is bad is not a good idea. The constitution is for big important issues, not for small ones.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution to say gay marriage is not allowed. This is just a simple issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think many states are Democratic or Republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, it should be up to each state whether or not to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said that. I do not think the president should decide what each state can or cannot do. The president is not in every state, so he should not make decisions for all states.\n\nI think some things should be left to the individual states. The president will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision because they will live with it.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I don't think the school officials acted wrong. Myspace is a public place on the internet. If you post something there, you know it's for everyone to see. School officials can see it even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it from home.\n\nIf they see something that could stop a school shooting, they have the right to see it. They have a responsibility to keep students safe. If they go on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, that's okay. They want to keep the school safe and good.\n\nBut if they go on just to get students in trouble, that's not okay. I think it's an invasion of privacy. However, if they can make the school a safer place, I don't think it's a problem.\n\nIt's easy to say things on the internet, but you never know who will see them. If you say something bad about someone, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something on the internet, it's always there. If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.\n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy. School officials are trying to keep the school safe. If they see something that can help, they should see it.\n\nI don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they see something that can make the school safer, that's okay. If they go on the internet to help keep students safe, it's not a problem.\n\nThey were just trying to keep the school safe. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening. They were trying to stop something like the Columbine school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help stop the people who did it. I thought we should go over there and make them stop fighting with each other. But I was not prepared for the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake by going to war without a clear plan. We just went in without thinking about the problems we might face. War is different for them than it is for us. They think about war in a way that is very different from how we think about it. They want to fight for their country, but I don't think they want to make their country better.\n\nWe went to war for revenge, and because the people wanted to go. President Bush thought it was the right thing to do. But I think he should have thought more carefully about the consequences. We couldn't just let them go on hurting people, but we should have had a better plan to help them.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They will always be like that. We are not the right people to change them. I think we are just causing problems for ourselves by staying there. We are wasting our time and resources. We can't stay in their country forever. Once we leave, things will fall apart again. We are not making enough progress, and it's time to go home."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

For example, gay marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong opinions on these subjects, but its views are old-fashioned in some ways.\n\nIf the Church changes its thinking, it will not lose its followers. Some people disagree with the Church on these issues. They do not like the Church's views. They think the Church is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or for priests to be married. Many people do not think this is fair. They think priests should be able to have families like other people. The Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too.\n\nI do not think it is fair for priests to be different from everyone else. They should be able to have both a job and a family. This would make the Church more accepting and fair.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I believe people are born with their sexual orientation. They do not choose it. It is not something they can control. \n\nGay people should not be blamed for being gay. They should not be treated unfairly because of who they are. \n\nIt is not right to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. This is not fair.\n\nPeople are born gay. They are not born straight. It is not a choice. They should not be punished for being gay.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. Marriage is not a matter for the government. It is a personal thing. \n\nThe government should not tell people they are wrong for being gay. They should not punish them for being who they are. \n\nThe government should not interfere in people's lives. They should not decide who people can love and marry. \n\nPeople should be free to love who they want and get married if they want. The government should not stop them.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere's no good reason not to. Many people think gay couples threaten the traditional family, but that's not true. It's different, but it's not the same.\n\nGay couples have the right to the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to visit each other in the hospital and make decisions about each other's care. It's not fair to call them anything less than family.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are like other couples in many ways. They have the same chance of a happy and successful relationship. They just want a marriage certificate, not a church wedding.\n\nIf we separate church and state, there's no reason to deny gay couples the same rights as everyone else. It's like segregation - separate but unequal.\n\nSome people worry about adoption and how gay couples will affect their community. But kids from gay parents are the same as kids from straight parents. They need love and support, not a certain kind of family.\n\nPeople worry about how kids will turn out, but it's not fair to blame a child's parents for their choices. Gay couples can be just as good parents as straight couples.\n\nI think the government should help make gay marriage legal everywhere. The amendment to ban it is unfair. President Bush's views on this are based on his own morals, but morality can be different from person to person.\n\nSome people believe gay people are damaged or have a personality problem, but that's not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not popular opinion.\n\nIf we listen to people who know, we might see things differently. We should treat everyone equal, regardless of their orientation.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. I want to say something about marijuana. Just because a drug is illegal does not mean it has good qualities. I think it is not good to make marijuana available to the public. But I do think it can be good for medical use. If a drug is illegal, it does not mean it has no good qualities. I think people should be able to use its good qualities.\n\nThere are some medicines that are illegal, but doctors use them. For example, oxycotton, Vicodin, and Perocets. They are controlled medicines, but they are good for people. If we do not use marijuana because it is taboo, that is not fair. We should look at its good qualities.\n\nMarijuana is different from alcohol. If you use too much marijuana, it can cause problems. But if you use too much alcohol, it can also cause problems. It is a difficult issue. I think we should make marijuana legal, but slowly. If we make it legal all at once, people might use it too much. But if we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly.\n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, people might use it for medical reasons.",
            "The church has changed a lot in the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was a child, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends at church on weekends.\n\nThe church now has a special service for teenagers. It lasts only 30 minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. They wear beach clothes or jeans and khakis. In the past, people dressed up for church. Now it is more casual.\n\nI do not know about the church's politics. But I think the biggest change I see is how people dress.\n\nThe church has been accused of problems with priests and pedophilia. I do not think allowing priests to marry or allowing female priests would have prevented these problems. Some married men are still pedophiles. It is the person, not the marriage or the job, that causes the problem.\n\nPeople choose to become priests. If they want to be married, they should choose a different religion. There are religions that allow priests to be married. \n\nI think pedophilia is a genetic problem. People are born with it. It is not something they become. Genetics play a big role in it. The church cannot stop people from being born with these tendencies.\n\nIf the church knew about the problems and tried to hide them, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea at first. But then the September 11th attacks happened. The US went to war in Iraq for many reasons. Some people think that the Bush administration used the war as a reason to take action. They said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this has been proven wrong.\n\nThe Bush administration told the American people that Iraq was connected to the September 11th attacks. They said Saddam Hussein was like Osama Bin Laden. But this was a lie.\n\nThis makes me very upset. Colin Powell, the former Secretary of State, said he was not sure about the evidence. He was unsure even when he was presenting it to the United Nations.\n\nI think this is very wrong. The Bush administration should have told the truth to the American people. This is a serious mistake. It is against the law for a president to lie.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution. They tried to make it less important. They wanted to go to war.\n\nOne of the former Treasury Secretaries said that President Bush wanted to go to war because of a personal reason. He wanted to avenge his father's failed war with Iraq.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US leaves now, there could be more violence and people could die. The US and the United Nations are trying to find a solution. They want to get other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia involved to help restore order.\n\nBut I am not sure this is a good idea. It could make more problems in the long run. Iraq's government is weak. The parliament is not working well. The Prime Minister does not have much control.

            "I have thoughts about the War in Iraq. I feel it is not a good idea. The war was not officially declared by the U.S. government. I think we went to war because of the September 11 attacks. Iraq was blamed for the attacks. I am not very informed about the war. But I know that our goal is to help Iraq build a democracy. We also want to control their oil. However, I think this is not a good reason to stay in Iraq. The war makes many people unhappy. If we stay in Iraq, we will have to make them like us. This will take a long time. If we leave, they will be angry with us. They will have to start all over. I am not sure what to think.\n\nI think the war should continue, but we should not call it a war anymore. We only use guns to show that we are strong. I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. The war was not officially declared by Congress. This is important. Congress must declare a war before it starts. I do not think it is fair to stay in Iraq. We are wasting our resources. I also feel bad for President Bush. He is making a bad decision. It is like the Vietnam War. That war was not officially declared either. It was called a meaningless war. Now, President Bush is being called a bad president for starting this war. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end because it is hurting them. But I also do not want to leave them behind. They have lives too. However, if we stay in Iraq, we will try to change their culture. This will make things worse. The Al-Kaida group will get stronger and they will hate us more. I think the war will last for a long time.",
            "I do not think a government should make something legal or not.  I think this is a decision for churches to make. The Constitution says there must be a separation of church and state. This is clear. It is stated very clearly in the Constitution. If a government tries to make a law about it, they would be going against the Constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make something illegal are choosing which church's beliefs are right and which are wrong. Many Catholics and Christians do not support it. But I do not think the government can tell churches what to do. The government's job is to protect people's freedom to believe what they want.\n\nThe separation of church and state has been a key part of the Constitution. It helps us have religious freedom in the United States. If we had an amendment about this, it would be against what is already in the Constitution. It would also be one of the only amendments that helps the government, not the people. I do not think this is right.\n\nI do not believe the government should be involved in this issue. The president's push for this amendment is because of his own personal feelings. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. I think it is up to the churches to decide what is right or wrong, not the government.\n\nI do not see how this amendment will help the country. It may even make things better.

            "The war in Iraq. I think the US government was not honest with Americans about why we went to war. They said we went to war because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. But the two things are not closely connected. The government made the American people believe this, using their anger towards the terrorists. In 2003, the US invaded Iraq.\n\nI am against war, especially a surprise attack. I think the war in Iraq is similar to the Vietnam War. The US government should have learned from its past mistakes.\n\nMany American soldiers have died in Iraq. This is sad. The US government removed the Iraqi government, but it did not prepare for the problems that would come after. There was chaos and a power vacuum. Now the US is trying to put a democracy in Iraq, but it is a difficult process.\n\nIn the past, the US tried to do the same thing in Vietnam. They wanted to remove the Communists and put a democracy in place. But it did not work well. It was a long and hard process. The US government should have known this.\n\nIf the US is going to go to war, it must be prepared for all outcomes. The government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq. Many American soldiers are still dying, and the Iraqi troops are still learning how to police their own country. It takes time to build a new government.\n\nI think the US government tried to deceive the American people. They made it seem like the war would be easy and short. But it is not that simple. Democracy is not easy to create. In the US, it took a long time to build our democracy.\n\nI was thinking about the presidential election in 2004. I wanted to give President Bush a chance to finish what he started. But now, it's hard to leave Iraq. The US took away their government and way of life. We can't just leave now.\n\nHowever, we must also think about the many American casualties. How many lives are we willing to risk for a free Iraq? The reason we invaded Iraq was to make it a democracy, but why not do the same in other countries? I think the real reason is the oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nBefore the war, the US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Why did the US not attack North Korea, which actually had those weapons? I don't think the US government is honest or thorough in its decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I don't think that will happen soon.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage.  I have always been.  I think it is a personal preference.  Recently, science has shown that it may be biological, not caused by society.  This makes it unfair for people to be treated differently because of something they cannot control.  I believe it is inhumane.\n\nI think politics and government should not interfere with personal matters.  Marriage is a personal choice, not a government issue.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because of the law.  But they live like any other family.  They walk their dogs and do other normal things.\n\nI do not agree with President Bush and others who try to define marriage in their own way.  I think this is ridiculous.\n\nI have read and heard that some people may be born with a chemical in their brain that makes them gay.  This is different from growing up in a certain way.  So, it may not be a choice.\n\nThe main problem is that marriage is a private matter.  If a man and woman want to get married, they can do it secretly.  But if two people of the same sex want to get married, it is a big public issue.  I think marriage should be a private matter, not a public one.\n\nNo, I do not agree with that.",

You cannot control what people think about you later. \n\nAs a Resident Advisor, I have already dealt with this issue. When you put something on the internet, it can affect people's opinions of you. If you talk about bad things, like violence or shootings, people will talk about it. You cannot control what they say.\n\nThe internet is public. If you have friends on Myspace or Facebook, they can see your messages. The school administration must take notice of these messages. They cannot ignore them. If they do, something bad might happen, and they could have prevented it.\n\nBut, some people just joke around on the internet. It can be hard to know what is serious and what is not. In our school, something like this happened. A student was overheard saying something, and someone reported it to the school. We found out who said it and looked at their Facebook page. They had posted some things that might seem funny, but were not funny in that situation.\n\nWhen you put something on the internet, it is not private. If you don't want people to see it, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think or take seriously. School officials should not be friends with their students on the internet. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nFor example, a teacher should not make a fake Facebook account to friend their students. That is not right. I wouldn't want to be friends with my residents on the internet, either. I don't want to know about their private lives. If they post things on Facebook, that's not my problem.",

Myspace is a website where people can share information about themselves. If you want to see someone's information on Myspace, you must be a friend with them.

They do not want to admit their mistake.\n\nPolls show that 75 to 80% of people around the world think the war was a bad idea. This is true in Iraq, where 80% of people think the war was a bad idea. Even 70% of the US soldiers in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and that we should leave in a year.\n\nThe war was already a problem before we went in. Now, leaving is also a problem. It's hard to know what to do in the Middle East. We have a big difference in culture between the US and Middle Eastern countries. The US thought it could bring democracy to Iraq, but the people of Iraq would have made different choices.\n\nSaddam was a bad leader, but we should have thought about the pros and cons before going to war. The war has made things worse. We should leave Iraq now.\n\nI don't see a reason to stay in Iraq. The US government has ideas about why we should stay, but I do not agree. I think it's better to leave now. Many Iraqis want us to leave, and we should listen to them.\n\nIf we ask Iraqis what to do, they want us to leave. They know their country better than we do. If we leave and things get worse, we can say, \"We did what you asked us to do.\" We can help Iraq after we leave, but we will not be heroes in the Middle East. We can at least say we tried to do the right thing.",
            "I think there is still a problem with different treatment of men and women in the United States. This is not just for women, but also for men in some jobs. Many people have a hard time working below a woman because of how society has been since a long time ago. \n\nWomen often see a job they can do and have good qualifications for it, but the group in charge does not choose them for the job because historically, women do not usually work in high positions. The same thing happens to men in jobs like fashion or being a parent at home. People often look down on men who stay home to take care of children because society thinks they should be working to make money.\n\nIn the fashion industry, some people do not take men seriously if they are interested in fashion. This is because men who like fashion often have different styles of life. People may think that men who like fashion do not know what fashion is for women. \n\nSociety has a set way of thinking, but it is changing slowly. Women are doing better in their jobs and becoming leaders. Men are also staying home to take care of their children and people are starting to accept this. If we continue working at this pace, I think the problem will be solved. We need to show the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against, but we should not force it. If we do it too fast, people will resist. We have made a lot of progress and change takes time.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against because of where they are from. If someone from a farm goes to a high position in a company, others might look down on them because of their accent. This is another example of how people can be discriminated against.",
            "My understanding is that marijuana is no longer a crime. It has been made legal by law. They changed it from a crime to a traffic ticket. When you get caught with marijuana, you get a ticket, not arrested or punished. This is good for people who have jobs. It is bad to have a drug charge because it affects your future. But if it is not a crime, it is better.\n\nSome people think it is not good to make marijuana legal because it costs a lot to arrest and punish people. They think it is better to use that money for important things like education, help for the elderly, and food for people who do not have enough.\n\nIn some cities, people do not want marijuana to be legal because they do not agree with it. But in some places, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it is a good idea to make money from it to help the city.\n\nI do not think marijuana should be everywhere like cigarettes. It is still not accepted in some places. If it is sold openly, it might be bad. Some people think it is not good to smoke and drive. They also think it is not good for people's lifestyles.\n\nAlcohol is bad for people's driving skills. Marijuana can be bad for people's behavior. Both substances have bad effects. But people react differently to them. Some people can use them and be fine, but some people cannot.\n\nI think both substances are bad for people. We should not generalize about them because people are different. We should think about the bad effects and decide what is best.",
            "I agree with this idea. \nBecause \nMany things in the Catholic Church are old customs. \nThey do things the same way for a long time. \nIt's good to have these traditions. \nBut it's also important to adapt to change. \nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey are strict about how things are done. \nSometimes, the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nThey also do not accept people of other religions. \nMy mom was an Episcopalian. \nMy dad was an Episcopalian. \nMy mom was a Catholic. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry my parents because of my dad's religion. \nThis is not being kind to others. \nWe always learn to love others in the Catholic Church. \nBut it's not kind to say love others and not accept them. \nSo, I think some Catholic teachings are good. \nBut the way the church acts is not always the same. \nIt's old-fashioned and they do not change. \nI don't think allowing priests to be married would stop them from hurting children. \nThose people will do bad things no matter what. \nA child is not the same as a spouse. \nThey will do bad things if they want to. \n\nFor example, people who hurt children will do that anyway. \nIt's not because they are married or not married. \nSo, I don't think allowing priests to be married would help.",
            "I have thought about this issue, but I do not have a strong opinion yet. It is hard to say if one side is right or wrong. This is a very difficult topic. The relationship between church and state is a problem. And defining marriage is also hard. It is hard to make a decision without hurting someone's feelings. I do not know what to think.\n\nI think that all civil unions are the same. Marriage is not just a government decision. It is a personal choice. People get tax breaks and special treatment if they are married. This is not fair if it only happens to some people. If two people want to be together, they should be able to. It is not up to the government to decide what kind of marriage it is.\n\nSome people want to allow gay marriage. This means two people of the same sex can be married. I think this is fair. They can have a civil union like anyone else.\n\nIf all states can agree on this, it should become a national law. But changing the constitution to say gay marriage is bad is not a good idea. The constitution is for big important issues, not for small ones.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution to say gay marriage is not allowed. This is just a simple issue.\n\nNo.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends. I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be allowed. Each state should decide for itself, not the president.\n\nI think many states are Democratic or Republican. Democratic states often support gay marriage. If you live in a state that supports gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should accept their laws.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. So, it should be up to each state whether or not to allow gay marriage.\n\nI already said that. I do not think the president should decide what each state can or cannot do. The president is not in every state, so he should not make decisions for all states.\n\nI think some things should be left to the individual states. The president will be out of office soon. If a new president wants to change the law, it will just go back and forth. Each state should make its own decision because they will live with it.\n\nI do not think so.",
            "I don't think the school officials acted wrong. Myspace is a public place on the internet. If you post something there, you know it's for everyone to see. School officials can see it even if it's not under the school's name. They can see it from home.\n\nIf they see something that could stop a school shooting, they have the right to see it. They have a responsibility to keep students safe. If they go on Myspace to check if students are doing things they shouldn't, that's okay. They want to keep the school safe and good.\n\nBut if they go on just to get students in trouble, that's not okay. I think it's an invasion of privacy. However, if they can make the school a safer place, I don't think it's a problem.\n\nIt's easy to say things on the internet, but you never know who will see them. If you say something bad about someone, it can come back to hurt you. If you post something on the internet, it's always there. If you do something bad, you will get in trouble.\n\nI don't think it was an invasion of privacy. School officials are trying to keep the school safe. If they see something that can help, they should see it.\n\nI don't think they should go on the internet just to catch students. But if they see something that can make the school safer, that's okay. If they go on the internet to help keep students safe, it's not a problem.\n\nThey were just trying to keep the school safe. They were trying to prevent something bad from happening. They were trying to stop something like the Columbine school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. At first, I thought it was a good idea because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to help stop the people who did it. I thought we should go over there and make them stop fighting with each other. But I was not prepared for the long-term effects.\n\nI think we made a mistake by going to war without a clear plan. We just went in without thinking about the problems we might face. War is different for them than it is for us. They think about war in a way that is very different from how we think about it. They want to fight for their country, but I don't think they want to make their country better.\n\nWe went to war for revenge, and because the people wanted to go. President Bush thought it was the right thing to do. But I think he should have thought more carefully about the consequences. We couldn't just let them go on hurting people, but we should have had a better plan to help them.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They will always be like that. We are not the right people to change them. I think we are just causing problems for ourselves by staying there. We are wasting our time and resources. We can't stay in their country forever. Once we leave, things will fall apart again. We are not making enough progress, and it's time to go home."
