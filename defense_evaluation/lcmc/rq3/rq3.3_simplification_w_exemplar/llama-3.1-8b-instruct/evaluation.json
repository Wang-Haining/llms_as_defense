            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. The Church is losing followers because many people think it is not accepting of some things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they may seem old-fashioned to some people.\n\nIf the Church were to change its views and think more like people today, it might not lose followers. Many people disagree with the Church's views and do not want to be a part of it. The Church is against abortion, which can be a problem for people who think abortion is okay. The same is true for gay marriage. If someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family. So why can't priests have both? It is hard to know for sure if the Church would be different if priests could get married or if there were women priests.\n\nI think the Church should be more open to new ideas. It should think about what people want and need. This might help the Church keep its followers.",

But it is not a choice if you are born gay. I was born straight, and my friend was born gay. We did not choose it.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can or cannot get married. Marriage and love are personal things. The government should not judge people's love.\n\nPeople should be free to love whoever they want. We should not punish them for being different. The federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should only worry about the country's security and laws.\n\nI think same-sex marriage is a right.

Many medicines that are not allowed are used in the pharmacy because they have good qualities. We use medicines like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. These medicines are controlled. They are good and we use them. If we do not allow marijuana because of a bad image, that is not fair.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the new century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church service is now thirty minutes long. People dress casually, even in summer when they come straight from the beach. Families arrive late, and some wear jeans and khakis. The atmosphere has become more casual.\n\nAs for other things, this is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know the church's politics and rules.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I do not think these problems could have been stopped. There are married men who become pedophiles, and their attraction to young children is a personal issue, not because of their marriage status.\n\nWhen someone chooses to be a priest, it is their decision. Some religions allow their leaders to be married, but it does not prevent pedophilia. A person's sexuality is based on genetics. It is not something they become due to their upbringing. Genetics are something you are born with. You cannot hide it by getting married.\n\nThe church cannot prevent pedophilia. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they were always aware of these problems.\n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

One of their advisors said that the younger Bush wanted to get revenge against Saddam Hussein because of a problem from the past.\n\nNow, the war has been going on for a long time.

I think we use guns to show our power and to prove we are strong. \n\nI do not think it is fair to call it a war because it was not declared by Congress. We have to declare war to Congress to make it official.\n\nI think it is a good idea to stay in Iraq and help them, but it is also a waste of resources. It is making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war, and it was a waste of time.

            "The war in Iraq was a complicated situation. Some people think the government was not honest with Americans about why the war started. Before the war, the government suggested a connection between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. However, the two events are not closely related.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. I do not support war. I think the war was a mistake. It is like the Vietnam War. The US government learned from its mistakes in Vietnam, but it did not use this knowledge in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad. The US government took out the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for what happened after that. There was a power vacuum and chaos. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was a difficult process.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be hard to win. It was not a clear victory. We were fighting against the Iraqi people, not a regular army. Many people in Iraq did not want the US to be there. It's hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the US government should not have gone to war. If it did, it should have planned carefully for all possible outcomes. The government was not well prepared for what happened after the Iraqi government was removed. We are still in Iraq and many American soldiers are still dying. The US is trying to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but this takes a long time.\n\nThe US government tried to make the American people believe that the war would be easy and successful. But democracy is not easy to create. It took the US many years to develop its own democratic government. The government should have been honest with the American people about the difficulties of creating a new government in Iraq.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in Iraq. We have been there for a long time, and we cannot just leave now. We took away the Iraqi government and their way of life. But we must also consider the many American soldiers who have died. We should try to finish what we started, but we must think about the cost.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic country. But why did we not do the same thing in other countries? The reason is often oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but these were never found. We did know that North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade that country.\n\nI just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace there.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. I have always thought this. I believe it is a personal preference. Many scientists now think that a person's sexual preference is not because of their family or society, but because of their biology. I think this is a good reason to give them equal rights.\n\nI do not think the government should say who can get married. Marriage is a personal thing, not something the government should decide. I have friends who are gay but not married. They behave just like any other family. They walk their dogs and live like everyone else.\n\nI do not think it is right for someone like President Bush to tell us what marriage means. I think this is too much power for one person. I have read and heard that some scientists think that being gay is because of a chemical in the brain that is not normal in most people.\n\nI think there are many reasons why people are gay. It is not just because of how they were raised. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married without anyone bothering them.\n\nIt is not fair that gay couples have to get married in secret, like in Las Vegas. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big deal. I think marriage should be a private thing, not something the whole country talks about.",

It could be a test gone wrong, like one we did in school for our sociology class. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nIn our situation, someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found the person and looked at their Facebook page. They had some things on there that might be funny, but now they are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. If you don't want people to see something, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their personal pages. But if something is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously.\n\nFor example, if a teacher makes a fake account and friends students, that's not right. It's the same as spying. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal pictures or know what they are doing. It's not my job.\n\nThe school must take care of problems they find. But they should not be looking at students' private information.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. The purpose was good at the start. We wanted to help a country with no fair government. But now I am not sure we are doing this for the right reasons. We may be fighting just to show that we are strong.\n\nI think our motives were once good. We wanted to help a country with no freedom. But now I think we are fighting for other things. It started with a good reason, but now I am not sure. It makes me think of the past when we had problems with other leaders, like Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we made our point early on. Starting the war was a strong statement. But it has gone on for many years. I think that is too long. We should have stopped a long time ago.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country with a bad leader, that is a good reason to fight. But I do not think that is why we are fighting now. I think we are fighting just to fight. We want to win, but we do not have a clear victory.\n\nI think it is time to stop the war. The country we are fighting for will soon have to take care of itself. We should be spending our money on our own problems, like poverty and poor schools. We have many problems that need our help.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. This money could be used for better things, like building roads or helping people get health care. We should be using our money to improve our own country, not to fight a war that we are not winning.\n\nI think that is all I want to say about this.",
            "I have a question. It is about online privacy. On the internet, it is easy to see information that people put on websites like Myspace. If you post something on the internet, it is likely that many people will see it.\n\nMyspace is a website where you can list your friends. You need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you add someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put something on the internet, you should understand that many people will see it.\n\nIt is hard to have someone check all students' online profiles to prevent problems. But if someone finds something bad by accident, is that good or bad? It depends on the situation. If someone is looking for something bad, it is not good. But if they just happened to see it by chance, it might be good that they did.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that people can see things about me. There was a TV show about a man who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information online. You put your class schedule and photos, and people can know a lot about you. I limit what I put on my Facebook, but I also want to be able to talk to my friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I am not sure if that was right. I don't know if they had the power to tell students they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. I want to talk about it. But I feel strange saying it now. Many people already said they were against the war from the start. I also said I was against it. However, I think it's not as important now.\n\nI looked at many polls. People from the United States, Iraq, and all over the world said the war was a bad idea. More than 75% of the world's population thinks so. Most Iraqis, American soldiers, and even people from the United States agree with them.\n\nThe war started as a bad situation. It became worse. Now, pulling out is a difficult problem. The US and the Middle East have big cultural differences. It's hard to understand each other.\n\nThe US government thought they could bring democracy to Iraq easily. But Iraqis want to make their own decisions. They don't want democracy forced on them. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but that's no reason to go to war.\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the advantages and disadvantages. We should not invade a country and make it a disaster. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The Iraqi people want us to leave. They even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know better.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help them later, we can be seen as the good guys. But, unfortunately, it's hard to be the good guys in the Middle East.",
            "I think the United States still has a problem with gender discrimination. This problem exists in many areas, but it is worse in some jobs than others. The issue is not just with women. Men can also face discrimination in certain jobs.\n\nFor example, some men have trouble getting promoted to higher positions because they work for women. This is because society has always seen men as the leaders. As a result, people have a hard time accepting men working for women.\n\nIn other areas like fashion, men who like fashion are often looked down upon. People think it's not a typical job for men. And if a man is a stay-at-home parent, society sees it as strange. They think he should be working and bringing home the money.\n\nIn some industries, people don't take men seriously if they are into fashion. They think that men who like fashion are different. This can make it hard for men to succeed in these jobs.\n\nGender discrimination is a problem in the United States. It will take a lot of time to change. But we can see some progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in the business world. More men are staying home to raise their children, and people are starting to see this as a good thing.\n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different. We should not force people to accept these qualities, but instead, let them see the good things about these people. If we do this slowly, people will start to accept them.\n\nIt's not just about men and women. People from different places and with different backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm who doesn't have perfect grammar can still be a great leader. But other people might look down on him because of his grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States still has a problem with gender and social discrimination. But we can make progress if we do things slowly and promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a criminal offense. This means people who use it will get a ticket, not arrested. This is a good idea because it saves money for the government. They do not have to pay for court cases and jails. In a place like Denver, where people are open-minded, this is a good idea. The city can use the saved money for important things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some people are concerned about the effects of marijuana. They think it should not be everywhere. Some people worry that if it is legalized, people will smoke it and drive, which is not safe. Many people still do not like the idea of smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana both have bad effects. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can affect how people live their lives. But people react differently to these substances. Some people can use them and be fine, while others have problems.\n\nIt is hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. But one thing is true: both alcohol and marijuana have bad effects.",
            "I agree with you. Here's why: Many things they do are traditional. They have done them for a long time. This is good. It's also important to change and adapt. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, they look down on people who do not follow their rules. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents were not married in a Catholic church. My mom was a Catholic, and my dad was not. This was not because of my dad's religion, but because the church did not accept him.\n\nCatholic teaching says to love others. But some Catholic practices go against this teaching. This is because they are out of date. They continue to follow these practices anyway.\n\nI do not think this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could marry. But I do not think this would stop them from hurting children. It is a different situation. They would probably still do bad things.\n\nSome people who hurt children will do it no matter what. They will do it because they are hurting a child, not a partner. If they want to do something bad, they will do it. Getting married or not will not stop them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop these bad things from happening. They would probably still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this problem. I do not have enough information to say who is right or wrong. This is a difficult issue. \n\nIt is about the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage. It is hard to do this without hurting anyone's feelings. I think civil unions are a good idea. But I do not know if marriage should be a civil union.\n\nMarriage is a very important thing. It is when two people join together. The government should not care about the type of marriage. It should just be a union of two people. \n\nSome people want to get married because of their church. But the government should not care about this. It is not fair to say some people can get married and others cannot.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is similar. Two people who love each other should be able to join together. I do not think it is right to say no to this.\n\nIf many states agree on this, they should try to make it a law for the whole country. But making a change to the constitution to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It should only be changed for very big reasons. \n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This is why I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends, and I think being gay is a personal choice. However, I do not agree with this lifestyle. I do think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national issue. Instead, I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some states are more democratic and some are more republican. Democratic states will probably support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you probably know how the people feel about gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should be willing to accept the laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I believe each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. This way, each state can make its own choice.\n\nI already said that I believe each state should decide. I do not think the president should make a decision for the whole country. President Bush wants to ban gay marriage nationwide. I disagree with this. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president does not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state runs itself. He will be out of office soon, and a new president may change the law. This decision should be left to each state, so it is clear what the people want.\n\nNo, I do not want a national ban on gay marriage.",
            "I don't agree with school officials looking at what students post on the internet. \nHowever, if they are searching for things that might make the school safer, that's okay. \nIf school officials want to know if students are doing something bad, they can find it on the internet, even if it's not on the school's website. \nSo, it's not really private.\n\nWhen people post things on the internet, they have to know that others will see them. \nThis includes school officials. \nIf school officials find something that might make the school safer, they can use that information. \n\nSchools have a job to keep students safe. \nThey can look at things on the internet to do this. \nFor example, they might want to know if students are drinking or smoking. \nIf they find out about this, they can get the students in trouble.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy for school officials to look at things on the internet. \nHowever, if it makes the school safer, it's okay. \nSchool officials are just trying to keep students safe.\n\nWhen students post things on the internet, they should be careful. \nIt's easy to get in trouble if something they post is not good. \nIt's like writing a letter that someone else can read. \nIf you post something on the internet, it will stay there forever. \n\nSchool officials looked at things on the internet to keep the school safe. \nThey wanted to make sure nothing bad would happen, like a school shooting. \nThis is like practicing for emergencies. \nThey want to be ready to keep students safe.\n\nSchool officials are doing their job by looking at things on the internet. \nThey want to make sure the school is a safe place for students. \nThis is what they are supposed to do.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. I think it was a big mistake. I was upset after nine eleven happened. I wanted to help. But now I think we went into the situation unprepared. We did not think about the results. We were angry and wanted revenge. \n\nWe did not think about what would happen next. This caused problems. The people over there were already fighting with each other. We going there did not help. They could not fight with us because they were busy fighting with themselves.\n\nI do not care about what happens over there now. I think they are not very organized. They do not think about making their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war without a plan. We did not know what we were doing. We thought we could change their country. But we cannot change people. They will always be the same. We made a mistake by staying in that country.\n\nWe are not making progress. We are just making things worse. If we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should go home."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. The Church is losing followers because many people think it is not accepting of some things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they may seem old-fashioned to some people.\n\nIf the Church were to change its views and think more like people today, it might not lose followers. Many people disagree with the Church's views and do not want to be a part of it. The Church is against abortion, which can be a problem for people who think abortion is okay. The same is true for gay marriage. If someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family. So why can't priests have both? It is hard to know for sure if the Church would be different if priests could get married or if there were women priests.\n\nI think the Church should be more open to new ideas. It should think about what people want and need. This might help the Church keep its followers.",

But it is not a choice if you are born gay. I was born straight, and my friend was born gay. We did not choose it.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can or cannot get married. Marriage and love are personal things. The government should not judge people's love.\n\nPeople should be free to love whoever they want. We should not punish them for being different. The federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should only worry about the country's security and laws.\n\nI think same-sex marriage is a right.

Many medicines that are not allowed are used in the pharmacy because they have good qualities. We use medicines like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. These medicines are controlled. They are good and we use them. If we do not allow marijuana because of a bad image, that is not fair.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the new century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church service is now thirty minutes long. People dress casually, even in summer when they come straight from the beach. Families arrive late, and some wear jeans and khakis. The atmosphere has become more casual.\n\nAs for other things, this is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know the church's politics and rules.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I do not think these problems could have been stopped. There are married men who become pedophiles, and their attraction to young children is a personal issue, not because of their marriage status.\n\nWhen someone chooses to be a priest, it is their decision. Some religions allow their leaders to be married, but it does not prevent pedophilia. A person's sexuality is based on genetics. It is not something they become due to their upbringing. Genetics are something you are born with. You cannot hide it by getting married.\n\nThe church cannot prevent pedophilia. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they were always aware of these problems.\n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

One of their advisors said that the younger Bush wanted to get revenge against Saddam Hussein because of a problem from the past.\n\nNow, the war has been going on for a long time.

I think we use guns to show our power and to prove we are strong. \n\nI do not think it is fair to call it a war because it was not declared by Congress. We have to declare war to Congress to make it official.\n\nI think it is a good idea to stay in Iraq and help them, but it is also a waste of resources. It is making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war, and it was a waste of time.

            "The war in Iraq was a complicated situation. Some people think the government was not honest with Americans about why the war started. Before the war, the government suggested a connection between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. However, the two events are not closely related.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. I do not support war. I think the war was a mistake. It is like the Vietnam War. The US government learned from its mistakes in Vietnam, but it did not use this knowledge in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad. The US government took out the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for what happened after that. There was a power vacuum and chaos. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was a difficult process.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be hard to win. It was not a clear victory. We were fighting against the Iraqi people, not a regular army. Many people in Iraq did not want the US to be there. It's hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the US government should not have gone to war. If it did, it should have planned carefully for all possible outcomes. The government was not well prepared for what happened after the Iraqi government was removed. We are still in Iraq and many American soldiers are still dying. The US is trying to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but this takes a long time.\n\nThe US government tried to make the American people believe that the war would be easy and successful. But democracy is not easy to create. It took the US many years to develop its own democratic government. The government should have been honest with the American people about the difficulties of creating a new government in Iraq.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in Iraq. We have been there for a long time, and we cannot just leave now. We took away the Iraqi government and their way of life. But we must also consider the many American soldiers who have died. We should try to finish what we started, but we must think about the cost.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic country. But why did we not do the same thing in other countries? The reason is often oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but these were never found. We did know that North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade that country.\n\nI just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace there.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. I have always thought this. I believe it is a personal preference. Many scientists now think that a person's sexual preference is not because of their family or society, but because of their biology. I think this is a good reason to give them equal rights.\n\nI do not think the government should say who can get married. Marriage is a personal thing, not something the government should decide. I have friends who are gay but not married. They behave just like any other family. They walk their dogs and live like everyone else.\n\nI do not think it is right for someone like President Bush to tell us what marriage means. I think this is too much power for one person. I have read and heard that some scientists think that being gay is because of a chemical in the brain that is not normal in most people.\n\nI think there are many reasons why people are gay. It is not just because of how they were raised. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married without anyone bothering them.\n\nIt is not fair that gay couples have to get married in secret, like in Las Vegas. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big deal. I think marriage should be a private thing, not something the whole country talks about.",

It could be a test gone wrong, like one we did in school for our sociology class. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nIn our situation, someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found the person and looked at their Facebook page. They had some things on there that might be funny, but now they are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. If you don't want people to see something, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their personal pages. But if something is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously.\n\nFor example, if a teacher makes a fake account and friends students, that's not right. It's the same as spying. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal pictures or know what they are doing. It's not my job.\n\nThe school must take care of problems they find. But they should not be looking at students' private information.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. The purpose was good at the start. We wanted to help a country with no fair government. But now I am not sure we are doing this for the right reasons. We may be fighting just to show that we are strong.\n\nI think our motives were once good. We wanted to help a country with no freedom. But now I think we are fighting for other things. It started with a good reason, but now I am not sure. It makes me think of the past when we had problems with other leaders, like Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we made our point early on. Starting the war was a strong statement. But it has gone on for many years. I think that is too long. We should have stopped a long time ago.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country with a bad leader, that is a good reason to fight. But I do not think that is why we are fighting now. I think we are fighting just to fight. We want to win, but we do not have a clear victory.\n\nI think it is time to stop the war. The country we are fighting for will soon have to take care of itself. We should be spending our money on our own problems, like poverty and poor schools. We have many problems that need our help.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. This money could be used for better things, like building roads or helping people get health care. We should be using our money to improve our own country, not to fight a war that we are not winning.\n\nI think that is all I want to say about this.",
            "I have a question. It is about online privacy. On the internet, it is easy to see information that people put on websites like Myspace. If you post something on the internet, it is likely that many people will see it.\n\nMyspace is a website where you can list your friends. You need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you add someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put something on the internet, you should understand that many people will see it.\n\nIt is hard to have someone check all students' online profiles to prevent problems. But if someone finds something bad by accident, is that good or bad? It depends on the situation. If someone is looking for something bad, it is not good. But if they just happened to see it by chance, it might be good that they did.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that people can see things about me. There was a TV show about a man who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information online. You put your class schedule and photos, and people can know a lot about you. I limit what I put on my Facebook, but I also want to be able to talk to my friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I am not sure if that was right. I don't know if they had the power to tell students they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. I want to talk about it. But I feel strange saying it now. Many people already said they were against the war from the start. I also said I was against it. However, I think it's not as important now.\n\nI looked at many polls. People from the United States, Iraq, and all over the world said the war was a bad idea. More than 75% of the world's population thinks so. Most Iraqis, American soldiers, and even people from the United States agree with them.\n\nThe war started as a bad situation. It became worse. Now, pulling out is a difficult problem. The US and the Middle East have big cultural differences. It's hard to understand each other.\n\nThe US government thought they could bring democracy to Iraq easily. But Iraqis want to make their own decisions. They don't want democracy forced on them. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but that's no reason to go to war.\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the advantages and disadvantages. We should not invade a country and make it a disaster. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The Iraqi people want us to leave. They even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know better.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help them later, we can be seen as the good guys. But, unfortunately, it's hard to be the good guys in the Middle East.",
            "I think the United States still has a problem with gender discrimination. This problem exists in many areas, but it is worse in some jobs than others. The issue is not just with women. Men can also face discrimination in certain jobs.\n\nFor example, some men have trouble getting promoted to higher positions because they work for women. This is because society has always seen men as the leaders. As a result, people have a hard time accepting men working for women.\n\nIn other areas like fashion, men who like fashion are often looked down upon. People think it's not a typical job for men. And if a man is a stay-at-home parent, society sees it as strange. They think he should be working and bringing home the money.\n\nIn some industries, people don't take men seriously if they are into fashion. They think that men who like fashion are different. This can make it hard for men to succeed in these jobs.\n\nGender discrimination is a problem in the United States. It will take a lot of time to change. But we can see some progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in the business world. More men are staying home to raise their children, and people are starting to see this as a good thing.\n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different. We should not force people to accept these qualities, but instead, let them see the good things about these people. If we do this slowly, people will start to accept them.\n\nIt's not just about men and women. People from different places and with different backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm who doesn't have perfect grammar can still be a great leader. But other people might look down on him because of his grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States still has a problem with gender and social discrimination. But we can make progress if we do things slowly and promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a criminal offense. This means people who use it will get a ticket, not arrested. This is a good idea because it saves money for the government. They do not have to pay for court cases and jails. In a place like Denver, where people are open-minded, this is a good idea. The city can use the saved money for important things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some people are concerned about the effects of marijuana. They think it should not be everywhere. Some people worry that if it is legalized, people will smoke it and drive, which is not safe. Many people still do not like the idea of smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana both have bad effects. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can affect how people live their lives. But people react differently to these substances. Some people can use them and be fine, while others have problems.\n\nIt is hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. But one thing is true: both alcohol and marijuana have bad effects.",
            "I agree with you. Here's why: Many things they do are traditional. They have done them for a long time. This is good. It's also important to change and adapt. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, they look down on people who do not follow their rules. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents were not married in a Catholic church. My mom was a Catholic, and my dad was not. This was not because of my dad's religion, but because the church did not accept him.\n\nCatholic teaching says to love others. But some Catholic practices go against this teaching. This is because they are out of date. They continue to follow these practices anyway.\n\nI do not think this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could marry. But I do not think this would stop them from hurting children. It is a different situation. They would probably still do bad things.\n\nSome people who hurt children will do it no matter what. They will do it because they are hurting a child, not a partner. If they want to do something bad, they will do it. Getting married or not will not stop them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop these bad things from happening. They would probably still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this problem. I do not have enough information to say who is right or wrong. This is a difficult issue. \n\nIt is about the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage. It is hard to do this without hurting anyone's feelings. I think civil unions are a good idea. But I do not know if marriage should be a civil union.\n\nMarriage is a very important thing. It is when two people join together. The government should not care about the type of marriage. It should just be a union of two people. \n\nSome people want to get married because of their church. But the government should not care about this. It is not fair to say some people can get married and others cannot.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is similar. Two people who love each other should be able to join together. I do not think it is right to say no to this.\n\nIf many states agree on this, they should try to make it a law for the whole country. But making a change to the constitution to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It should only be changed for very big reasons. \n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This is why I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends, and I think being gay is a personal choice. However, I do not agree with this lifestyle. I do think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national issue. Instead, I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some states are more democratic and some are more republican. Democratic states will probably support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you probably know how the people feel about gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should be willing to accept the laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I believe each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. This way, each state can make its own choice.\n\nI already said that I believe each state should decide. I do not think the president should make a decision for the whole country. President Bush wants to ban gay marriage nationwide. I disagree with this. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president does not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state runs itself. He will be out of office soon, and a new president may change the law. This decision should be left to each state, so it is clear what the people want.\n\nNo, I do not want a national ban on gay marriage.",
            "I don't agree with school officials looking at what students post on the internet. \nHowever, if they are searching for things that might make the school safer, that's okay. \nIf school officials want to know if students are doing something bad, they can find it on the internet, even if it's not on the school's website. \nSo, it's not really private.\n\nWhen people post things on the internet, they have to know that others will see them. \nThis includes school officials. \nIf school officials find something that might make the school safer, they can use that information. \n\nSchools have a job to keep students safe. \nThey can look at things on the internet to do this. \nFor example, they might want to know if students are drinking or smoking. \nIf they find out about this, they can get the students in trouble.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy for school officials to look at things on the internet. \nHowever, if it makes the school safer, it's okay. \nSchool officials are just trying to keep students safe.\n\nWhen students post things on the internet, they should be careful. \nIt's easy to get in trouble if something they post is not good. \nIt's like writing a letter that someone else can read. \nIf you post something on the internet, it will stay there forever. \n\nSchool officials looked at things on the internet to keep the school safe. \nThey wanted to make sure nothing bad would happen, like a school shooting. \nThis is like practicing for emergencies. \nThey want to be ready to keep students safe.\n\nSchool officials are doing their job by looking at things on the internet. \nThey want to make sure the school is a safe place for students. \nThis is what they are supposed to do.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. I think it was a big mistake. I was upset after nine eleven happened. I wanted to help. But now I think we went into the situation unprepared. We did not think about the results. We were angry and wanted revenge. \n\nWe did not think about what would happen next. This caused problems. The people over there were already fighting with each other. We going there did not help. They could not fight with us because they were busy fighting with themselves.\n\nI do not care about what happens over there now. I think they are not very organized. They do not think about making their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war without a plan. We did not know what we were doing. We thought we could change their country. But we cannot change people. They will always be the same. We made a mistake by staying in that country.\n\nWe are not making progress. We are just making things worse. If we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should go home."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change some of its views. The Church is losing followers because many people think it is not accepting of some things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Church has strong views on these issues, but they may seem old-fashioned to some people.\n\nIf the Church were to change its views and think more like people today, it might not lose followers. Many people disagree with the Church's views and do not want to be a part of it. The Church is against abortion, which can be a problem for people who think abortion is okay. The same is true for gay marriage. If someone believes in gay marriage, they might not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nI do not see why priests cannot be married or why there cannot be female priests. The Church says priests are married to God, but everyone else has a job and a family. So why can't priests have both? It is hard to know for sure if the Church would be different if priests could get married or if there were women priests.\n\nI think the Church should be more open to new ideas. It should think about what people want and need. This might help the Church keep its followers.",

But it is not a choice if you are born gay. I was born straight, and my friend was born gay. We did not choose it.\n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can or cannot get married. Marriage and love are personal things. The government should not judge people's love.\n\nPeople should be free to love whoever they want. We should not punish them for being different. The federal government should not interfere in people's personal lives. They should only worry about the country's security and laws.\n\nI think same-sex marriage is a right.

Many medicines that are not allowed are used in the pharmacy because they have good qualities. We use medicines like oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet. These medicines are controlled. They are good and we use them. If we do not allow marijuana because of a bad image, that is not fair.

            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the new century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I went to a private school, and I saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together.\n\nThe church service is now thirty minutes long. People dress casually, even in summer when they come straight from the beach. Families arrive late, and some wear jeans and khakis. The atmosphere has become more casual.\n\nAs for other things, this is what I have noticed about the church I know. I do not know the church's politics and rules.\n\nRegarding the accusations against Catholic priests and pedophilia, I do not think these problems could have been stopped. There are married men who become pedophiles, and their attraction to young children is a personal issue, not because of their marriage status.\n\nWhen someone chooses to be a priest, it is their decision. Some religions allow their leaders to be married, but it does not prevent pedophilia. A person's sexuality is based on genetics. It is not something they become due to their upbringing. Genetics are something you are born with. You cannot hide it by getting married.\n\nThe church cannot prevent pedophilia. If they knew about it and tried to cover it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they were always aware of these problems.\n\nI have no other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",

One of their advisors said that the younger Bush wanted to get revenge against Saddam Hussein because of a problem from the past.\n\nNow, the war has been going on for a long time.

I think we use guns to show our power and to prove we are strong. \n\nI do not think it is fair to call it a war because it was not declared by Congress. We have to declare war to Congress to make it official.\n\nI think it is a good idea to stay in Iraq and help them, but it is also a waste of resources. It is making President Bush look bad. \n\nThe Vietnam War was also an undeclared war, and it was a waste of time.

            "The war in Iraq was a complicated situation. Some people think the government was not honest with Americans about why the war started. Before the war, the government suggested a connection between the invasion of Iraq and the 9/11 attacks. However, the two events are not closely related.\n\nThe United States invaded Iraq in 2003. I do not support war. I think the war was a mistake. It is like the Vietnam War. The US government learned from its mistakes in Vietnam, but it did not use this knowledge in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad. The US government took out the Iraqi government, but it was not prepared for what happened after that. There was a power vacuum and chaos. The US tried to put a democratic government in Iraq, but this was a difficult process.\n\nThe US government should have known that the war would be hard to win. It was not a clear victory. We were fighting against the Iraqi people, not a regular army. Many people in Iraq did not want the US to be there. It's hard to defeat people who are fighting for their country.\n\nI think the US government should not have gone to war. If it did, it should have planned carefully for all possible outcomes. The government was not well prepared for what happened after the Iraqi government was removed. We are still in Iraq and many American soldiers are still dying. The US is trying to train Iraqi soldiers and police, but this takes a long time.\n\nThe US government tried to make the American people believe that the war would be easy and successful. But democracy is not easy to create. It took the US many years to develop its own democratic government. The government should have been honest with the American people about the difficulties of creating a new government in Iraq.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in Iraq. We have been there for a long time, and we cannot just leave now. We took away the Iraqi government and their way of life. But we must also consider the many American soldiers who have died. We should try to finish what we started, but we must think about the cost.\n\nOne of the main reasons for the invasion was to make Iraq a democratic country. But why did we not do the same thing in other countries? The reason is often oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. Another reason for the war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but these were never found. We did know that North Korea had weapons of mass destruction, but we did not invade that country.\n\nI just hope that the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace there.

            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. I have always thought this. I believe it is a personal preference. Many scientists now think that a person's sexual preference is not because of their family or society, but because of their biology. I think this is a good reason to give them equal rights.\n\nI do not think the government should say who can get married. Marriage is a personal thing, not something the government should decide. I have friends who are gay but not married. They behave just like any other family. They walk their dogs and live like everyone else.\n\nI do not think it is right for someone like President Bush to tell us what marriage means. I think this is too much power for one person. I have read and heard that some scientists think that being gay is because of a chemical in the brain that is not normal in most people.\n\nI think there are many reasons why people are gay. It is not just because of how they were raised. If two people love each other, they should be able to get married without anyone bothering them.\n\nIt is not fair that gay couples have to get married in secret, like in Las Vegas. If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it without telling anyone. But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a big deal. I think marriage should be a private thing, not something the whole country talks about.",

It could be a test gone wrong, like one we did in school for our sociology class. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nIn our situation, someone overheard someone talking and called the school. We found the person and looked at their Facebook page. They had some things on there that might be funny, but now they are serious.\n\nThe internet is public. If you don't want people to see something, don't put it there. You cannot control what people think. School officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their personal pages. But if something is brought to their attention, they must take it seriously.\n\nFor example, if a teacher makes a fake account and friends students, that's not right. It's the same as spying. I wouldn't friend my residents because I don't want to see their personal pictures or know what they are doing. It's not my job.\n\nThe school must take care of problems they find. But they should not be looking at students' private information.",
            "I think the war has gone on for too long. The purpose was good at the start. We wanted to help a country with no fair government. But now I am not sure we are doing this for the right reasons. We may be fighting just to show that we are strong.\n\nI think our motives were once good. We wanted to help a country with no freedom. But now I think we are fighting for other things. It started with a good reason, but now I am not sure. It makes me think of the past when we had problems with other leaders, like Saddam Hussein.\n\nI think we made our point early on. Starting the war was a strong statement. But it has gone on for many years. I think that is too long. We should have stopped a long time ago.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country with a bad leader, that is a good reason to fight. But I do not think that is why we are fighting now. I think we are fighting just to fight. We want to win, but we do not have a clear victory.\n\nI think it is time to stop the war. The country we are fighting for will soon have to take care of itself. We should be spending our money on our own problems, like poverty and poor schools. We have many problems that need our help.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on the war. This money could be used for better things, like building roads or helping people get health care. We should be using our money to improve our own country, not to fight a war that we are not winning.\n\nI think that is all I want to say about this.",
            "I have a question. It is about online privacy. On the internet, it is easy to see information that people put on websites like Myspace. If you post something on the internet, it is likely that many people will see it.\n\nMyspace is a website where you can list your friends. You need to be friends with someone to see their profile. But when you add someone as a friend, you are giving them permission to see your information. So, if you put something on the internet, you should understand that many people will see it.\n\nIt is hard to have someone check all students' online profiles to prevent problems. But if someone finds something bad by accident, is that good or bad? It depends on the situation. If someone is looking for something bad, it is not good. But if they just happened to see it by chance, it might be good that they did.\n\nI have a Facebook account. It bothers me that people can see things about me. There was a TV show about a man who wanted to show how easy it is to get information. He got a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. I wouldn't meet someone like that.\n\nIt is hard to know who can see your information online. You put your class schedule and photos, and people can know a lot about you. I limit what I put on my Facebook, but I also want to be able to talk to my friends.\n\nMy roommate told me that her high school banned Myspace. I am not sure if that was right. I don't know if they had the power to tell students they couldn't have Myspace.",
            "I have thoughts about the war in Iraq. I want to talk about it. But I feel strange saying it now. Many people already said they were against the war from the start. I also said I was against it. However, I think it's not as important now.\n\nI looked at many polls. People from the United States, Iraq, and all over the world said the war was a bad idea. More than 75% of the world's population thinks so. Most Iraqis, American soldiers, and even people from the United States agree with them.\n\nThe war started as a bad situation. It became worse. Now, pulling out is a difficult problem. The US and the Middle East have big cultural differences. It's hard to understand each other.\n\nThe US government thought they could bring democracy to Iraq easily. But Iraqis want to make their own decisions. They don't want democracy forced on them. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but that's no reason to go to war.\n\nBefore going to war, we should think about the advantages and disadvantages. We should not invade a country and make it a disaster. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It's hard to get out.\n\nI don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq any longer. The Iraqi people want us to leave. They even think we should leave now. We are trying to help them, but they're telling us to go. I think they know better.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, then we can't blame them if things go wrong. If we decide to help them later, we can be seen as the good guys. But, unfortunately, it's hard to be the good guys in the Middle East.",
            "I think the United States still has a problem with gender discrimination. This problem exists in many areas, but it is worse in some jobs than others. The issue is not just with women. Men can also face discrimination in certain jobs.\n\nFor example, some men have trouble getting promoted to higher positions because they work for women. This is because society has always seen men as the leaders. As a result, people have a hard time accepting men working for women.\n\nIn other areas like fashion, men who like fashion are often looked down upon. People think it's not a typical job for men. And if a man is a stay-at-home parent, society sees it as strange. They think he should be working and bringing home the money.\n\nIn some industries, people don't take men seriously if they are into fashion. They think that men who like fashion are different. This can make it hard for men to succeed in these jobs.\n\nGender discrimination is a problem in the United States. It will take a lot of time to change. But we can see some progress. More women are becoming leaders and getting accepted in the business world. More men are staying home to raise their children, and people are starting to see this as a good thing.\n\nWe need to promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different. We should not force people to accept these qualities, but instead, let them see the good things about these people. If we do this slowly, people will start to accept them.\n\nIt's not just about men and women. People from different places and with different backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone from a farm who doesn't have perfect grammar can still be a great leader. But other people might look down on him because of his grammar.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States still has a problem with gender and social discrimination. But we can make progress if we do things slowly and promote the qualities of people who are often seen as different.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a criminal offense. This means people who use it will get a ticket, not arrested. This is a good idea because it saves money for the government. They do not have to pay for court cases and jails. In a place like Denver, where people are open-minded, this is a good idea. The city can use the saved money for important things like education, social programs, and food for the homeless.\n\nHowever, some people are concerned about the effects of marijuana. They think it should not be everywhere. Some people worry that if it is legalized, people will smoke it and drive, which is not safe. Many people still do not like the idea of smoking marijuana in public.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana both have bad effects. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can affect how people live their lives. But people react differently to these substances. Some people can use them and be fine, while others have problems.\n\nIt is hard to say how people will react to marijuana because everyone is different. But one thing is true: both alcohol and marijuana have bad effects.",
            "I agree with you. Here's why: Many things they do are traditional. They have done them for a long time. This is good. It's also important to change and adapt. \n\nA lot of Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, they look down on people who do not follow their rules. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people of other religions.\n\nFor example, my parents were not married in a Catholic church. My mom was a Catholic, and my dad was not. This was not because of my dad's religion, but because the church did not accept him.\n\nCatholic teaching says to love others. But some Catholic practices go against this teaching. This is because they are out of date. They continue to follow these practices anyway.\n\nI do not think this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could marry. But I do not think this would stop them from hurting children. It is a different situation. They would probably still do bad things.\n\nSome people who hurt children will do it no matter what. They will do it because they are hurting a child, not a partner. If they want to do something bad, they will do it. Getting married or not will not stop them.\n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop these bad things from happening. They would probably still happen.",
            "I am not sure about this problem. I do not have enough information to say who is right or wrong. This is a difficult issue. \n\nIt is about the separation of church and state, and how to define marriage. It is hard to do this without hurting anyone's feelings. I think civil unions are a good idea. But I do not know if marriage should be a civil union.\n\nMarriage is a very important thing. It is when two people join together. The government should not care about the type of marriage. It should just be a union of two people. \n\nSome people want to get married because of their church. But the government should not care about this. It is not fair to say some people can get married and others cannot.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is similar. Two people who love each other should be able to join together. I do not think it is right to say no to this.\n\nIf many states agree on this, they should try to make it a law for the whole country. But making a change to the constitution to stop gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution. It should only be changed for very big reasons. \n\nI do not think so.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This is why I have mixed feelings about homosexuality. I have many gay friends, and I think being gay is a personal choice. However, I do not agree with this lifestyle. I do think it should be legal. I do not think it is a national issue. Instead, I believe each state should decide for itself.\n\nI think some states are more democratic and some are more republican. Democratic states will probably support gay marriage. If you live in a democratic state, you probably know how the people feel about gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that decision. You chose to live there, so you should be willing to accept the laws.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I believe each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. This way, each state can make its own choice.\n\nI already said that I believe each state should decide. I do not think the president should make a decision for the whole country. President Bush wants to ban gay marriage nationwide. I disagree with this. Each state should make its own decision.\n\nI think some things should be left up to each state. The president does not live in every state, so he should not decide how each state runs itself. He will be out of office soon, and a new president may change the law. This decision should be left to each state, so it is clear what the people want.\n\nNo, I do not want a national ban on gay marriage.",
            "I don't agree with school officials looking at what students post on the internet. \nHowever, if they are searching for things that might make the school safer, that's okay. \nIf school officials want to know if students are doing something bad, they can find it on the internet, even if it's not on the school's website. \nSo, it's not really private.\n\nWhen people post things on the internet, they have to know that others will see them. \nThis includes school officials. \nIf school officials find something that might make the school safer, they can use that information. \n\nSchools have a job to keep students safe. \nThey can look at things on the internet to do this. \nFor example, they might want to know if students are drinking or smoking. \nIf they find out about this, they can get the students in trouble.\n\nSome people might think it's an invasion of privacy for school officials to look at things on the internet. \nHowever, if it makes the school safer, it's okay. \nSchool officials are just trying to keep students safe.\n\nWhen students post things on the internet, they should be careful. \nIt's easy to get in trouble if something they post is not good. \nIt's like writing a letter that someone else can read. \nIf you post something on the internet, it will stay there forever. \n\nSchool officials looked at things on the internet to keep the school safe. \nThey wanted to make sure nothing bad would happen, like a school shooting. \nThis is like practicing for emergencies. \nThey want to be ready to keep students safe.\n\nSchool officials are doing their job by looking at things on the internet. \nThey want to make sure the school is a safe place for students. \nThis is what they are supposed to do.",
            "I have mixed feelings about the war. I think it was a big mistake. I was upset after nine eleven happened. I wanted to help. But now I think we went into the situation unprepared. We did not think about the results. We were angry and wanted revenge. \n\nWe did not think about what would happen next. This caused problems. The people over there were already fighting with each other. We going there did not help. They could not fight with us because they were busy fighting with themselves.\n\nI do not care about what happens over there now. I think they are not very organized. They do not think about making their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave.\n\nWe went to war without a plan. We did not know what we were doing. We thought we could change their country. But we cannot change people. They will always be the same. We made a mistake by staying in that country.\n\nWe are not making progress. We are just making things worse. If we leave, their country will fall apart. We cannot stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should go home."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church has some problems. They are losing followers. This is because the Church is not very accepting of many things. They have strong views on things like marriage between two men or women, abortion, and birth control. These views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its views, they might not lose followers.\n\nMany people are against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on some subjects. The Church says abortion is wrong, and if you think abortion is right, you may not want to be a part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you support gay marriage, you may not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow priests to be married or have women as priests. But this may not have stopped the Church's problems. It is hard to say what would have happened if priests could be married or if there were women priests.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God and are devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. They can balance work and family life. Why can't priests?",
            "I am not opposed to marriage between people of the same sex. \n\nI think people are born gay. They do not make this choice. \n\nOthers and I do not think it is right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. \n\nPeople are born gay. They do not have a choice. This is not a decision they made. \n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. This is a personal issue. \n\nI do not think gay people should be punished. They should be free to be who they are. \n\nI believe the federal government should not be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of national security or morality. It is a personal issue. \n\nPeople should be free to live as they are. They should not be punished for being gay.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Here is why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But this is not true. Gay couples are not the same as heterosexual couples. They have their own unique things.\n\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin. One side is heads, and the other side is tails. They are not the same.\n\nGay couples have the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to own property and get health care just like anyone else. If a gay person is sick, their partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is not just about being family, it's about love.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are happy and successful just like any other couple. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship as everyone else.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church. It's about getting a marriage certificate from the government. This is a legal document, not a church thing.\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. If the government gives gay couples a civil union, they should be allowed to marry.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and community issues. But this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They are the same as any other couple.\n\nThe main problem is how children are treated by other people in society. Gay couples should be treated the same as any other couple. They should be able to go to school and play with their friends like everyone else.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like anyone else. They can be involved in their community and be good neighbors.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The government should not make laws based on one person's moral views. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue. He thinks about this because of his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are not normal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to scientists and experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.\n\nIf we listen to the experts, we will see that gay people are just like everyone else. They are normal people who deserve to be treated with respect.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. A drug is not good or bad just because the law says so. I don't think we should make it available to the public. But we can use it to help people if a doctor says it is okay.\n\nMany medicines are not legal, but we use them because they are helpful. We use oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet to help patients. These are not available to just anyone. We use them because they are good for people. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is not legal, then that is not fair. Everyone should be able to use marijuana if it helps them.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you take too much marijuana, it can be bad for you. But if you drink too much alcohol, it can also be bad for you. We should not ban marijuana like we do with alcohol. We should make it legal, but people must use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea of marijuana because it is not allowed. But marijuana is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way we think about marijuana, people will use it responsibly. We can use it to help people who are sick.",
            "The church has changed over time. It is not as strict as it was before. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes. I also had a matching purse. This was what I wore every time I went to church. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on the weekends. We would go to church together. Now, things are different. The church now has a shorter service. It lasts only thirty minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families often come in late. The church is more casual now, even on Sundays. People wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change.\n\nThere are other things I notice about the church. This is the church I know. I do not understand the church's politics. I do not know why they make some decisions.\n\nSome people say the Catholic Church could have prevented problems with priests by allowing women to be priests or by allowing priests to get married. I do not think this would have helped. Some men are married and still have problems with children. Their choice to be a priest is not the reason for their problems. \n\nIn some religions, priests are allowed to get married. Some people become priests and still want to be married. If they want to practice their faith and be married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think the reasons for some priests' problems are based on their genes. I do not think people become this way because of how they are raised. It is their genes. We cannot change that with marriage. It may come out later. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about the problem and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea, but the September 11th attacks changed everything. Many people were in shock and the US went to war in Iraq for different reasons. The Bush administration connected the war to Osama Bin Laden and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people and still has not admitted it. Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the UN. This is wrong and against the law. It is an impeachable offense to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution and has tried to limit its power since 9/11. They wanted to go to war from the start. A former treasury secretary said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's feud with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to get more oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US withdraws now, there will be civil war and more deaths. But a new plan to have other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia help Iraq is not good. It will create more problems because Iraq's independence will be at risk.\n\nThe new Iraqi government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A radical leader's party has a lot of power and there are still many groups fighting for control. This is causing problems in the political process.",
            "I did not know what to say. Let me think about it. \n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated problem. I do not know a lot about it. However, I think it started because of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11. We went to war in Iraq because we thought they were involved. \n\nNow, I am not sure why we are staying there. I think it is because we want to build a democratic government in Iraq. We also want to get oil from them. But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we have to build a democracy. This will take time. It is not easy to build a new government. If we leave, people in Iraq will be unhappy with us. They will have to start again. \n\nI am confused about the war in Iraq. I do not know what to say. I think we should not call it a war anymore. It was not officially declared by Congress. I do not think it is a good reason to stay in Iraq.\n\nI do think it is good to help the people in Iraq. But it is also wasting our resources. I feel sorry for President Bush. The war is making him look bad. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared. That war is now known as a meaningless war.\n\nIt is hard to say what I think about the war in Iraq. There are many families with sons and daughters in the war. I want to help them, but I also think we are hurting the people in Iraq. We are making their lives harder. They have different customs and ways of life. If we stay, we will try to change them. This will make things worse for them.\n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a complicated problem. I do not know what to say.",
            "I do not think it is right for a state or government to make laws about what churches can or cannot do. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control the church. \n\nThe Constitution clearly says this. If the government tries to make laws about the church, it would go against what is already written. \n\nSome people are trying to make it illegal because most Catholics and Christians do not support it. But that is not right. The government should not decide what churches can or cannot do. It is up to the churches to decide.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows people to be free to believe what they want. The government did plan to make an amendment to the Constitution, but that would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this amendment because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not right. The church should decide what it wants to do, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for an amendment to ban this. It will not help the economy. It might even help society in some way.\n\nI have said all I need to say.",
            "The war in Iraq was a serious problem. The American government did not tell the truth about why it started the war. They said it was because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. However, that was not the real reason.\n\nMany people do not like war. I am one of them. I think it is never a good idea to start a war just to be safe. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq without a good reason.\n\nThis war was very similar to the Vietnam War. The US government wanted to remove the government of Iraq and make a new one. But they did not think about what would happen after the war. Many American soldiers died in the war. It was a sad and tragic thing.\n\nThe US government said it would be easy to make Iraq a democracy. But it was not that easy. It takes a long time to build a new government. The US government did not think about this before the war. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nThe war in Iraq is difficult to end. If we start a war, we must think about what will happen after. We must be prepared for all possible outcomes. The US government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers are still in Iraq and many are dying. The US government is trying to teach the Iraqi people how to govern themselves. But it is a long and hard process. I think the US government made a mistake by going to war. They did not tell the truth about their reasons. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this. If we go to war, we must finish what we start. But we must also think about the cost. Many American soldiers have died in the war. Is it worth it? I am not sure.\n\nOne of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was to get their oil. Oil is a very important resource. I think the US government was not honest about its reasons for the war. They said it was to make Iraq a democracy, but that was not true.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon and there will be peace. But I do not think it will be easy.",
            "I am for gay marriage.  I have always been.  I believe it is a personal preference and not something that people should be judged for.  Many studies have shown that being gay is not chosen, but rather something that people are born with.\n\nI do not think that government should decide who can and cannot get married.  Marriage is a personal choice between two people, not something that should be controlled by the state.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live normal lives and contribute to our community just like anyone else.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to limit gay marriage is wrong.  Marriage is not something that he or anyone else should be able to decide.  I believe it is ridiculous for him to try to control what is a personal choice.\n\nMany studies have shown that being gay is not a choice, but rather something that people are born with.  It is not something that people can change, and it is not something that they should be ashamed of.  I believe that people should be free to make their own choices about who they love and who they want to marry.\n\nMarriage is a personal choice between two people, and it should not be controlled by the government.  If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing.  But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a different story.\n\nI believe that gay marriage should be a personal choice and not something that is decided by the government.  It is a private matter that should not be made public.",
            "You cannot put something on the internet that is not true. The internet is a public place. Anything you put there is seen by many people. When you are friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you can see their messages. But this does not mean that the school can look at your private messages. The school can only act on something if someone tells them about it. They cannot ignore it or do nothing.\n\nIt can be hard to know what to believe. Some people only joke around on the internet. It could be like a school project that went wrong. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nSomething like this happened at our school. Someone overheard a student saying something and told the school. We found out it was not true, but it was on the student's Facebook page. The school got worried because it looked like he meant it. When you put something on the internet, you have no control over who sees it. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it on the internet.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their pages or messages. If a student's friend tells the school something, it's not an invasion of privacy. The school has to act on it if there is danger. They should not listen to phone calls or texts without a good reason.\n\nA teacher should not make a secret account on the internet to be friends with students. This is not right. It's not fair to the students. The teacher should not know things about them that they don't want to share.",
            "I think the war has gone too long. \n\nThe purpose of the war was good at first. We wanted to bring democracy to a country that did not have a fair government. But now, it seems like the main reason for the war is just to show that we are a powerful country.\n\nI also think the original reasons for the war were not clear. We were influenced by past events, like problems between the United States and Iraq. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons involved, it would not be good.\n\nI believe we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a strong statement. But the war has gone on for many years. This is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, it would be a good reason for war. But I think our reason has changed over time. We are now fighting just to fight.\n\nThe war has gone on too long. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used to solve problems in our own country, like poverty and poor public services.\n\nWe should stop the war. We have our own problems to solve. We should use our money to make our country better, not to fight a war that we no longer believe in.\n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. War should not be in our long-term budget. We have many problems in our country that need our attention, like health care and education.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question about something. It is true that people can see information on the internet. This is because when you put something online, it can be seen by many people. If you have a profile on a website, you allow others to see it when you add them as friends. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to have someone watch all students in school to prevent bad things. This could be unfair to some students. It is also not right to look at everyone's profiles just to find something wrong with them.\n\nPeople are worried about strangers seeing their personal information online. For example, someone on TV showed how easy it is to get information about someone on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. You can also put pictures, class schedules, and other information on the internet. It can be hard to decide how much to share because you want to keep in touch with your friends.\n\nYou can limit what you put online, but you never know who can see it. My friend's high school did not allow students to have Myspace accounts. This made me wonder if the school had the right to tell students what to do online.",
            "I am a little confused. We have a lot to talk about, including the Iraq War. I do not want to be part of the group of people who always say they were against the war from the start. But, I was against it. However, it does not matter much now. Most people agree that the war was not a good idea. In fact, almost eighty percent of people around the world think this way. Even many U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we arrived. It was a disaster. Now, leaving is also a difficult problem. There is a big difference in culture between the United States and countries in the Middle East. This makes it hard for us to understand each other. We must respect how other people want to live their lives.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading Iraq. We must weigh the good and bad results of our actions. The war has been a disaster, like quicksand that pulls us down.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may think there are good reasons to stay, but I do not agree. I do not see a reason why we should not leave now. Many Iraqis think the same way. They say we should leave within a year. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to leave.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, we cannot blame them if things go badly. If we decide to help them later, we will at least be seen as trying to do the right thing. Maybe we will never be seen as good guys in the Middle East, but it will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem called gender bias in the United States. It is not just about men and women. The kind of work you do also makes a difference. \n\nFor women, it can be harder to succeed because of a thing called the glass ceiling. Even though there should be equality, it is hard for women to find jobs where they can be in charge. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In the past, men have been in charge. \n\nIn many workplaces, women may have the qualifications for a job, but they may not get it because of their gender. It is the same for men in some industries, like fashion. \n\nSometimes, people do not take men seriously if they are into fashion. They may think that men who like fashion are not normal. \n\nThe same thing happens with men who stay at home to raise their children. Society does not expect men to do this, and it can be hard for them. \n\nBut things are changing. More and more women are getting important jobs, and people are starting to accept this. Men who stay at home are also becoming more accepted. \n\nWe need to promote people who are different and show their good qualities. If we do this in a gentle way, people will accept it. We have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. \n\nWe also have a problem with people from different places being judged. If someone from a farm has poor grammar but is very smart, they may have trouble getting ahead because of where they come from. \n\nThis is another example of discrimination. It can be between men and women, or it can be between people from different places. \n\nI do not know what the solution is, but we need to keep working on it.",
            "I think they made marijuana a less serious crime. They changed it from a crime that gets you arrested to a ticket you get for something like a traffic ticket. This means that you don't have to be arrested and taken to jail. But, even if it's no longer a serious crime, some people worry about the future problems it can cause. These problems can affect things like job interviews and other important situations.\n\nSome people think it costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for their lawyers. This is true, especially for small cities that don't have much money. That's why some cities don't want to make marijuana a less serious crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some cities, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it's okay to make marijuana less serious. This means the city can use the money it saves to help people, like children, the elderly, and those who are homeless.\n\nI think it's a good idea to make marijuana less serious. It's not something that should be everywhere, and there are good reasons for that. Also, making it less serious can save money for cities.\n\nOne problem with making it totally legal is that people might smoke it and drive cars. This is not safe. Also, in some places, smoking marijuana is still not accepted. If it's out in the open, it might be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlcohol can be more dangerous than marijuana because it affects your driving skills. But marijuana can still have bad effects on people's lifestyles. How people react to substances is different. Some people are careful and don't have problems, while others do.\n\nIt's hard to say how marijuana affects people because everyone reacts differently. But I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. Here's why:\n\nThe Catholic Church has many old customs that have been done for a long time. Some are good, but it is also important to change when necessary. Many Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules perfectly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people from other religions. For example, my parents' religions were different. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not Catholic.\n\nI do not think this is fair. We are taught to love others, which is a basic Catholic rule. It is hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them. I think the Catholic Church's teachings and its practices do not match.\n\nI do not think my own opinion on this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could get married, but it would not stop them from behaving badly. Some people would harm children, even if they were married. This is because they are harming children, not because they are single or married.\n\nThe Church should be fair and accept people from all religions. They should also be careful with the people they choose to be priests. This is because priests have a lot of power and influence.",
            "This is a very difficult subject. I am not sure what to think. Two things are very important here: government and church rules. One is about marriage and how it is defined. It is hard to decide on this issue without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a very special thing. It is between two people. But it is also a union of two people. It is like a partnership. The government should not decide what kind of marriage it is. This is because the government and church are separate.\n\nIf two people get married, they should be treated the same. They should not be looked at differently because of their marriage. They should get the same rights and taxes.\n\nThe question of gay marriage is also important. Two people love each other, and they want to be together. They should be able to get married and be treated the same as other couples.\n\nIf many states agree on this issue, it should be made into a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution. We should not make a big deal out of it.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends, and this makes me think carefully about the subject. I do not agree with the idea, but I believe it should be legal. I do not think it's a national issue. Instead, I think each state should make its own decision.\n\nIf a state is democratic, it will probably support gay marriage. If you live in that state, you will know how it feels about this issue. I don't think you should disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect its choice.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI already answered this question. This is my opinion.\n\nI don't think President Bush should decide for the whole country what to do about gay marriage. I believe each state should decide for itself. I disagree with his decision to ban gay marriage.\n\nI just think that the president should not make decisions for every state. He does not live in every state, so he cannot know what is best for each one. Some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nThe president will not be in office for much longer. If a new president decides to change the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. I think each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the choice, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have the answer to that question.",
            "I do not think school officials are wrong to look at student posts on Myspace. When you put something on the internet, it is like posting it in a public place. Everyone can see it, including school officials. They can find it even if it is not under the school's name.\n\nIf school officials look at Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think it is okay. Keeping students safe is the school's job. They should do what they can to make the school a safe place.\n\nSome school officials look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they should not be doing. They go on the internet to catch students who are breaking the rules. I think this is not right. It is an invasion of privacy. But if it helps make the school safer, I think it is okay.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself more when you are writing than when you are talking. When you post something on Myspace, you should think about what could happen. Once something is on the internet, it is always there. It can hurt you in the future.\n\nIf you do something bad when you are a student, it can come back and hurt you when you are older and important. You should think about this before you post something on the internet.\n\nI do not think school officials should go on Myspace just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to look, like to make the school safer, it is okay. Parents trust the school to be a safe place for their children. I think school officials are just trying to do their job.\n\nWhen I went to school, we had drills to prepare for a school shooting. We practiced what to do if someone came into the building. The school officials were trying to keep us safe. I think they are doing the same thing now by looking at Myspace.\n\nThey were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were just doing their job to keep the school a safe place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. I was affected by the September 11 attacks. I wanted to help. I thought we should go to another country and show them what we can do. But I now think we made a mistake.\n\nWe went to war without a good plan. We were angry and wanted revenge. I think we should have thought about the long-term effects. We didn't consider the people we were helping. They were busy fighting with each other.\n\nI don't think it's our job to help them. If they can't work together, we can't make a difference. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think the people there are fighting for themselves, not for a better country.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are not interested in improving their country; they want us to leave. I think we should do that. We went to war on impulse, without thinking. We were looking for revenge, not a solution.\n\nThe president wanted to go to war because the people wanted it. But he should have had a better plan. He should have thought about what we would do there. We didn't have a clear goal. We didn't work together. We just went to war.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They are the way they are. We can't stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We should not be there.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. We didn't think about what would happen. We were too angry. I don't think we should be in that country anymore."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church has some problems. They are losing followers. This is because the Church is not very accepting of many things. They have strong views on things like marriage between two men or women, abortion, and birth control. These views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its views, they might not lose followers.\n\nMany people are against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on some subjects. The Church says abortion is wrong, and if you think abortion is right, you may not want to be a part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you support gay marriage, you may not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow priests to be married or have women as priests. But this may not have stopped the Church's problems. It is hard to say what would have happened if priests could be married or if there were women priests.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God and are devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. They can balance work and family life. Why can't priests?",
            "I am not opposed to marriage between people of the same sex. \n\nI think people are born gay. They do not make this choice. \n\nOthers and I do not think it is right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. \n\nPeople are born gay. They do not have a choice. This is not a decision they made. \n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. This is a personal issue. \n\nI do not think gay people should be punished. They should be free to be who they are. \n\nI believe the federal government should not be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of national security or morality. It is a personal issue. \n\nPeople should be free to live as they are. They should not be punished for being gay.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Here is why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But this is not true. Gay couples are not the same as heterosexual couples. They have their own unique things.\n\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin. One side is heads, and the other side is tails. They are not the same.\n\nGay couples have the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to own property and get health care just like anyone else. If a gay person is sick, their partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is not just about being family, it's about love.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are happy and successful just like any other couple. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship as everyone else.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church. It's about getting a marriage certificate from the government. This is a legal document, not a church thing.\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. If the government gives gay couples a civil union, they should be allowed to marry.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and community issues. But this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They are the same as any other couple.\n\nThe main problem is how children are treated by other people in society. Gay couples should be treated the same as any other couple. They should be able to go to school and play with their friends like everyone else.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like anyone else. They can be involved in their community and be good neighbors.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The government should not make laws based on one person's moral views. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue. He thinks about this because of his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are not normal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to scientists and experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.\n\nIf we listen to the experts, we will see that gay people are just like everyone else. They are normal people who deserve to be treated with respect.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. A drug is not good or bad just because the law says so. I don't think we should make it available to the public. But we can use it to help people if a doctor says it is okay.\n\nMany medicines are not legal, but we use them because they are helpful. We use oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet to help patients. These are not available to just anyone. We use them because they are good for people. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is not legal, then that is not fair. Everyone should be able to use marijuana if it helps them.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you take too much marijuana, it can be bad for you. But if you drink too much alcohol, it can also be bad for you. We should not ban marijuana like we do with alcohol. We should make it legal, but people must use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea of marijuana because it is not allowed. But marijuana is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way we think about marijuana, people will use it responsibly. We can use it to help people who are sick.",
            "The church has changed over time. It is not as strict as it was before. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes. I also had a matching purse. This was what I wore every time I went to church. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on the weekends. We would go to church together. Now, things are different. The church now has a shorter service. It lasts only thirty minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families often come in late. The church is more casual now, even on Sundays. People wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change.\n\nThere are other things I notice about the church. This is the church I know. I do not understand the church's politics. I do not know why they make some decisions.\n\nSome people say the Catholic Church could have prevented problems with priests by allowing women to be priests or by allowing priests to get married. I do not think this would have helped. Some men are married and still have problems with children. Their choice to be a priest is not the reason for their problems. \n\nIn some religions, priests are allowed to get married. Some people become priests and still want to be married. If they want to practice their faith and be married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think the reasons for some priests' problems are based on their genes. I do not think people become this way because of how they are raised. It is their genes. We cannot change that with marriage. It may come out later. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about the problem and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea, but the September 11th attacks changed everything. Many people were in shock and the US went to war in Iraq for different reasons. The Bush administration connected the war to Osama Bin Laden and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people and still has not admitted it. Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the UN. This is wrong and against the law. It is an impeachable offense to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution and has tried to limit its power since 9/11. They wanted to go to war from the start. A former treasury secretary said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's feud with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to get more oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US withdraws now, there will be civil war and more deaths. But a new plan to have other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia help Iraq is not good. It will create more problems because Iraq's independence will be at risk.\n\nThe new Iraqi government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A radical leader's party has a lot of power and there are still many groups fighting for control. This is causing problems in the political process.",
            "I did not know what to say. Let me think about it. \n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated problem. I do not know a lot about it. However, I think it started because of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11. We went to war in Iraq because we thought they were involved. \n\nNow, I am not sure why we are staying there. I think it is because we want to build a democratic government in Iraq. We also want to get oil from them. But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we have to build a democracy. This will take time. It is not easy to build a new government. If we leave, people in Iraq will be unhappy with us. They will have to start again. \n\nI am confused about the war in Iraq. I do not know what to say. I think we should not call it a war anymore. It was not officially declared by Congress. I do not think it is a good reason to stay in Iraq.\n\nI do think it is good to help the people in Iraq. But it is also wasting our resources. I feel sorry for President Bush. The war is making him look bad. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared. That war is now known as a meaningless war.\n\nIt is hard to say what I think about the war in Iraq. There are many families with sons and daughters in the war. I want to help them, but I also think we are hurting the people in Iraq. We are making their lives harder. They have different customs and ways of life. If we stay, we will try to change them. This will make things worse for them.\n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a complicated problem. I do not know what to say.",
            "I do not think it is right for a state or government to make laws about what churches can or cannot do. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control the church. \n\nThe Constitution clearly says this. If the government tries to make laws about the church, it would go against what is already written. \n\nSome people are trying to make it illegal because most Catholics and Christians do not support it. But that is not right. The government should not decide what churches can or cannot do. It is up to the churches to decide.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows people to be free to believe what they want. The government did plan to make an amendment to the Constitution, but that would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this amendment because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not right. The church should decide what it wants to do, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for an amendment to ban this. It will not help the economy. It might even help society in some way.\n\nI have said all I need to say.",
            "The war in Iraq was a serious problem. The American government did not tell the truth about why it started the war. They said it was because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. However, that was not the real reason.\n\nMany people do not like war. I am one of them. I think it is never a good idea to start a war just to be safe. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq without a good reason.\n\nThis war was very similar to the Vietnam War. The US government wanted to remove the government of Iraq and make a new one. But they did not think about what would happen after the war. Many American soldiers died in the war. It was a sad and tragic thing.\n\nThe US government said it would be easy to make Iraq a democracy. But it was not that easy. It takes a long time to build a new government. The US government did not think about this before the war. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nThe war in Iraq is difficult to end. If we start a war, we must think about what will happen after. We must be prepared for all possible outcomes. The US government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers are still in Iraq and many are dying. The US government is trying to teach the Iraqi people how to govern themselves. But it is a long and hard process. I think the US government made a mistake by going to war. They did not tell the truth about their reasons. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this. If we go to war, we must finish what we start. But we must also think about the cost. Many American soldiers have died in the war. Is it worth it? I am not sure.\n\nOne of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was to get their oil. Oil is a very important resource. I think the US government was not honest about its reasons for the war. They said it was to make Iraq a democracy, but that was not true.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon and there will be peace. But I do not think it will be easy.",
            "I am for gay marriage.  I have always been.  I believe it is a personal preference and not something that people should be judged for.  Many studies have shown that being gay is not chosen, but rather something that people are born with.\n\nI do not think that government should decide who can and cannot get married.  Marriage is a personal choice between two people, not something that should be controlled by the state.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live normal lives and contribute to our community just like anyone else.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to limit gay marriage is wrong.  Marriage is not something that he or anyone else should be able to decide.  I believe it is ridiculous for him to try to control what is a personal choice.\n\nMany studies have shown that being gay is not a choice, but rather something that people are born with.  It is not something that people can change, and it is not something that they should be ashamed of.  I believe that people should be free to make their own choices about who they love and who they want to marry.\n\nMarriage is a personal choice between two people, and it should not be controlled by the government.  If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing.  But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a different story.\n\nI believe that gay marriage should be a personal choice and not something that is decided by the government.  It is a private matter that should not be made public.",
            "You cannot put something on the internet that is not true. The internet is a public place. Anything you put there is seen by many people. When you are friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you can see their messages. But this does not mean that the school can look at your private messages. The school can only act on something if someone tells them about it. They cannot ignore it or do nothing.\n\nIt can be hard to know what to believe. Some people only joke around on the internet. It could be like a school project that went wrong. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nSomething like this happened at our school. Someone overheard a student saying something and told the school. We found out it was not true, but it was on the student's Facebook page. The school got worried because it looked like he meant it. When you put something on the internet, you have no control over who sees it. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it on the internet.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their pages or messages. If a student's friend tells the school something, it's not an invasion of privacy. The school has to act on it if there is danger. They should not listen to phone calls or texts without a good reason.\n\nA teacher should not make a secret account on the internet to be friends with students. This is not right. It's not fair to the students. The teacher should not know things about them that they don't want to share.",
            "I think the war has gone too long. \n\nThe purpose of the war was good at first. We wanted to bring democracy to a country that did not have a fair government. But now, it seems like the main reason for the war is just to show that we are a powerful country.\n\nI also think the original reasons for the war were not clear. We were influenced by past events, like problems between the United States and Iraq. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons involved, it would not be good.\n\nI believe we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a strong statement. But the war has gone on for many years. This is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, it would be a good reason for war. But I think our reason has changed over time. We are now fighting just to fight.\n\nThe war has gone on too long. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used to solve problems in our own country, like poverty and poor public services.\n\nWe should stop the war. We have our own problems to solve. We should use our money to make our country better, not to fight a war that we no longer believe in.\n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. War should not be in our long-term budget. We have many problems in our country that need our attention, like health care and education.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question about something. It is true that people can see information on the internet. This is because when you put something online, it can be seen by many people. If you have a profile on a website, you allow others to see it when you add them as friends. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to have someone watch all students in school to prevent bad things. This could be unfair to some students. It is also not right to look at everyone's profiles just to find something wrong with them.\n\nPeople are worried about strangers seeing their personal information online. For example, someone on TV showed how easy it is to get information about someone on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. You can also put pictures, class schedules, and other information on the internet. It can be hard to decide how much to share because you want to keep in touch with your friends.\n\nYou can limit what you put online, but you never know who can see it. My friend's high school did not allow students to have Myspace accounts. This made me wonder if the school had the right to tell students what to do online.",
            "I am a little confused. We have a lot to talk about, including the Iraq War. I do not want to be part of the group of people who always say they were against the war from the start. But, I was against it. However, it does not matter much now. Most people agree that the war was not a good idea. In fact, almost eighty percent of people around the world think this way. Even many U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we arrived. It was a disaster. Now, leaving is also a difficult problem. There is a big difference in culture between the United States and countries in the Middle East. This makes it hard for us to understand each other. We must respect how other people want to live their lives.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading Iraq. We must weigh the good and bad results of our actions. The war has been a disaster, like quicksand that pulls us down.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may think there are good reasons to stay, but I do not agree. I do not see a reason why we should not leave now. Many Iraqis think the same way. They say we should leave within a year. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to leave.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, we cannot blame them if things go badly. If we decide to help them later, we will at least be seen as trying to do the right thing. Maybe we will never be seen as good guys in the Middle East, but it will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem called gender bias in the United States. It is not just about men and women. The kind of work you do also makes a difference. \n\nFor women, it can be harder to succeed because of a thing called the glass ceiling. Even though there should be equality, it is hard for women to find jobs where they can be in charge. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In the past, men have been in charge. \n\nIn many workplaces, women may have the qualifications for a job, but they may not get it because of their gender. It is the same for men in some industries, like fashion. \n\nSometimes, people do not take men seriously if they are into fashion. They may think that men who like fashion are not normal. \n\nThe same thing happens with men who stay at home to raise their children. Society does not expect men to do this, and it can be hard for them. \n\nBut things are changing. More and more women are getting important jobs, and people are starting to accept this. Men who stay at home are also becoming more accepted. \n\nWe need to promote people who are different and show their good qualities. If we do this in a gentle way, people will accept it. We have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. \n\nWe also have a problem with people from different places being judged. If someone from a farm has poor grammar but is very smart, they may have trouble getting ahead because of where they come from. \n\nThis is another example of discrimination. It can be between men and women, or it can be between people from different places. \n\nI do not know what the solution is, but we need to keep working on it.",
            "I think they made marijuana a less serious crime. They changed it from a crime that gets you arrested to a ticket you get for something like a traffic ticket. This means that you don't have to be arrested and taken to jail. But, even if it's no longer a serious crime, some people worry about the future problems it can cause. These problems can affect things like job interviews and other important situations.\n\nSome people think it costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for their lawyers. This is true, especially for small cities that don't have much money. That's why some cities don't want to make marijuana a less serious crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some cities, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it's okay to make marijuana less serious. This means the city can use the money it saves to help people, like children, the elderly, and those who are homeless.\n\nI think it's a good idea to make marijuana less serious. It's not something that should be everywhere, and there are good reasons for that. Also, making it less serious can save money for cities.\n\nOne problem with making it totally legal is that people might smoke it and drive cars. This is not safe. Also, in some places, smoking marijuana is still not accepted. If it's out in the open, it might be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlcohol can be more dangerous than marijuana because it affects your driving skills. But marijuana can still have bad effects on people's lifestyles. How people react to substances is different. Some people are careful and don't have problems, while others do.\n\nIt's hard to say how marijuana affects people because everyone reacts differently. But I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. Here's why:\n\nThe Catholic Church has many old customs that have been done for a long time. Some are good, but it is also important to change when necessary. Many Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules perfectly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people from other religions. For example, my parents' religions were different. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not Catholic.\n\nI do not think this is fair. We are taught to love others, which is a basic Catholic rule. It is hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them. I think the Catholic Church's teachings and its practices do not match.\n\nI do not think my own opinion on this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could get married, but it would not stop them from behaving badly. Some people would harm children, even if they were married. This is because they are harming children, not because they are single or married.\n\nThe Church should be fair and accept people from all religions. They should also be careful with the people they choose to be priests. This is because priests have a lot of power and influence.",
            "This is a very difficult subject. I am not sure what to think. Two things are very important here: government and church rules. One is about marriage and how it is defined. It is hard to decide on this issue without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a very special thing. It is between two people. But it is also a union of two people. It is like a partnership. The government should not decide what kind of marriage it is. This is because the government and church are separate.\n\nIf two people get married, they should be treated the same. They should not be looked at differently because of their marriage. They should get the same rights and taxes.\n\nThe question of gay marriage is also important. Two people love each other, and they want to be together. They should be able to get married and be treated the same as other couples.\n\nIf many states agree on this issue, it should be made into a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution. We should not make a big deal out of it.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends, and this makes me think carefully about the subject. I do not agree with the idea, but I believe it should be legal. I do not think it's a national issue. Instead, I think each state should make its own decision.\n\nIf a state is democratic, it will probably support gay marriage. If you live in that state, you will know how it feels about this issue. I don't think you should disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect its choice.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI already answered this question. This is my opinion.\n\nI don't think President Bush should decide for the whole country what to do about gay marriage. I believe each state should decide for itself. I disagree with his decision to ban gay marriage.\n\nI just think that the president should not make decisions for every state. He does not live in every state, so he cannot know what is best for each one. Some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nThe president will not be in office for much longer. If a new president decides to change the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. I think each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the choice, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have the answer to that question.",
            "I do not think school officials are wrong to look at student posts on Myspace. When you put something on the internet, it is like posting it in a public place. Everyone can see it, including school officials. They can find it even if it is not under the school's name.\n\nIf school officials look at Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think it is okay. Keeping students safe is the school's job. They should do what they can to make the school a safe place.\n\nSome school officials look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they should not be doing. They go on the internet to catch students who are breaking the rules. I think this is not right. It is an invasion of privacy. But if it helps make the school safer, I think it is okay.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself more when you are writing than when you are talking. When you post something on Myspace, you should think about what could happen. Once something is on the internet, it is always there. It can hurt you in the future.\n\nIf you do something bad when you are a student, it can come back and hurt you when you are older and important. You should think about this before you post something on the internet.\n\nI do not think school officials should go on Myspace just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to look, like to make the school safer, it is okay. Parents trust the school to be a safe place for their children. I think school officials are just trying to do their job.\n\nWhen I went to school, we had drills to prepare for a school shooting. We practiced what to do if someone came into the building. The school officials were trying to keep us safe. I think they are doing the same thing now by looking at Myspace.\n\nThey were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were just doing their job to keep the school a safe place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. I was affected by the September 11 attacks. I wanted to help. I thought we should go to another country and show them what we can do. But I now think we made a mistake.\n\nWe went to war without a good plan. We were angry and wanted revenge. I think we should have thought about the long-term effects. We didn't consider the people we were helping. They were busy fighting with each other.\n\nI don't think it's our job to help them. If they can't work together, we can't make a difference. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think the people there are fighting for themselves, not for a better country.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are not interested in improving their country; they want us to leave. I think we should do that. We went to war on impulse, without thinking. We were looking for revenge, not a solution.\n\nThe president wanted to go to war because the people wanted it. But he should have had a better plan. He should have thought about what we would do there. We didn't have a clear goal. We didn't work together. We just went to war.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They are the way they are. We can't stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We should not be there.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. We didn't think about what would happen. We were too angry. I don't think we should be in that country anymore."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church has some problems. They are losing followers. This is because the Church is not very accepting of many things. They have strong views on things like marriage between two men or women, abortion, and birth control. These views are old-fashioned in some ways. If the Church changed its views, they might not lose followers.\n\nMany people are against the Church because of its views. They do not agree with the Church on some subjects. The Church says abortion is wrong, and if you think abortion is right, you may not want to be a part of the Church. The same is true for gay marriage. If you support gay marriage, you may not want to be in a Church that says it is wrong.\n\nThe Church does not allow priests to be married or have women as priests. But this may not have stopped the Church's problems. It is hard to say what would have happened if priests could be married or if there were women priests.\n\nThe Church says priests are married to God and are devoted to their work. But other people have jobs and families too. They can balance work and family life. Why can't priests?",
            "I am not opposed to marriage between people of the same sex. \n\nI think people are born gay. They do not make this choice. \n\nOthers and I do not think it is right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot. \n\nPeople are born gay. They do not have a choice. This is not a decision they made. \n\nI do not think the federal government should decide who can get married. This is a personal issue. \n\nI do not think gay people should be punished. They should be free to be who they are. \n\nI believe the federal government should not be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of national security or morality. It is a personal issue. \n\nPeople should be free to live as they are. They should not be punished for being gay.",
            "I believe that gay marriage should be legal. Here is why.\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people think that gay couples are a threat to the heterosexual family. But this is not true. Gay couples are not the same as heterosexual couples. They have their own unique things.\n\nIt's like two different sides of the same coin. One side is heads, and the other side is tails. They are not the same.\n\nGay couples have the same civil rights as everyone else. They should be able to own property and get health care just like anyone else. If a gay person is sick, their partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is not just about being family, it's about love.\n\nMany studies show that gay couples are happy and successful just like any other couple. They have the same reasons for a happy relationship as everyone else.\n\nThe issue is not about getting married in a church. It's about getting a marriage certificate from the government. This is a legal document, not a church thing.\n\nSeparate but equal is not fair. If the government gives gay couples a civil union, they should be allowed to marry.\n\nSome people are worried about adoption and community issues. But this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. They are the same as any other couple.\n\nThe main problem is how children are treated by other people in society. Gay couples should be treated the same as any other couple. They should be able to go to school and play with their friends like everyone else.\n\nGay couples can be good parents just like anyone else. They can be involved in their community and be good neighbors.\n\nI think the federal government should be involved in making gay marriage legal. The government should not make laws based on one person's moral views. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views on this issue. He thinks about this because of his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's religion. This is not fair to everyone else.\n\nMany people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are not normal. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says this is not true. We should listen to scientists and experts, not just what our friends and neighbors think.\n\nIf we listen to the experts, we will see that gay people are just like everyone else. They are normal people who deserve to be treated with respect.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. A drug is not good or bad just because the law says so. I don't think we should make it available to the public. But we can use it to help people if a doctor says it is okay.\n\nMany medicines are not legal, but we use them because they are helpful. We use oxycodone, vicodin, and perocet to help patients. These are not available to just anyone. We use them because they are good for people. If we do not allow people to use marijuana because it is not legal, then that is not fair. Everyone should be able to use marijuana if it helps them.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. If you take too much marijuana, it can be bad for you. But if you drink too much alcohol, it can also be bad for you. We should not ban marijuana like we do with alcohol. We should make it legal, but people must use it responsibly.\n\nPeople have a bad idea of marijuana because it is not allowed. But marijuana is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way we think about marijuana, people will use it responsibly. We can use it to help people who are sick.",
            "The church has changed over time. It is not as strict as it was before. When I was young, I went to church every Sunday. I wore nice dresses and matching shoes. I also had a matching purse. This was what I wore every time I went to church. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on the weekends. We would go to church together. Now, things are different. The church now has a shorter service. It lasts only thirty minutes. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families often come in late. The church is more casual now, even on Sundays. People wear jeans and khakis. This is a big change.\n\nThere are other things I notice about the church. This is the church I know. I do not understand the church's politics. I do not know why they make some decisions.\n\nSome people say the Catholic Church could have prevented problems with priests by allowing women to be priests or by allowing priests to get married. I do not think this would have helped. Some men are married and still have problems with children. Their choice to be a priest is not the reason for their problems. \n\nIn some religions, priests are allowed to get married. Some people become priests and still want to be married. If they want to practice their faith and be married, they can choose a different faith.\n\nI think the reasons for some priests' problems are based on their genes. I do not think people become this way because of how they are raised. It is their genes. We cannot change that with marriage. It may come out later. The church cannot prevent this from happening. If they knew about the problem and covered it up, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I was okay with the idea, but the September 11th attacks changed everything. Many people were in shock and the US went to war in Iraq for different reasons. The Bush administration connected the war to Osama Bin Laden and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration lied to the American people and still has not admitted it. Colin Powell said he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it at the UN. This is wrong and against the law. It is an impeachable offense to lie to the people.\n\nThe Bush administration does not respect the US Constitution and has tried to limit its power since 9/11. They wanted to go to war from the start. A former treasury secretary said the younger Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's feud with Saddam Hussein. He also wanted to get more oil.\n\nI think the war has gone on too long. If the US withdraws now, there will be civil war and more deaths. But a new plan to have other countries like Syria and Saudi Arabia help Iraq is not good. It will create more problems because Iraq's independence will be at risk.\n\nThe new Iraqi government is not working well. The parliament is not effective and the Prime Minister does not have control. A radical leader's party has a lot of power and there are still many groups fighting for control. This is causing problems in the political process.",
            "I did not know what to say. Let me think about it. \n\nThe war in Iraq is a complicated problem. I do not know a lot about it. However, I think it started because of the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11. We went to war in Iraq because we thought they were involved. \n\nNow, I am not sure why we are staying there. I think it is because we want to build a democratic government in Iraq. We also want to get oil from them. But this is not a good reason to stay. It makes many people unhappy. \n\nIf we stay, we have to build a democracy. This will take time. It is not easy to build a new government. If we leave, people in Iraq will be unhappy with us. They will have to start again. \n\nI am confused about the war in Iraq. I do not know what to say. I think we should not call it a war anymore. It was not officially declared by Congress. I do not think it is a good reason to stay in Iraq.\n\nI do think it is good to help the people in Iraq. But it is also wasting our resources. I feel sorry for President Bush. The war is making him look bad. It is like the Vietnam War, which was also not declared. That war is now known as a meaningless war.\n\nIt is hard to say what I think about the war in Iraq. There are many families with sons and daughters in the war. I want to help them, but I also think we are hurting the people in Iraq. We are making their lives harder. They have different customs and ways of life. If we stay, we will try to change them. This will make things worse for them.\n\nI think the war in Iraq will go on for a long time. It is a complicated problem. I do not know what to say.",
            "I do not think it is right for a state or government to make laws about what churches can or cannot do. The United States Constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control the church. \n\nThe Constitution clearly says this. If the government tries to make laws about the church, it would go against what is already written. \n\nSome people are trying to make it illegal because most Catholics and Christians do not support it. But that is not right. The government should not decide what churches can or cannot do. It is up to the churches to decide.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows people to be free to believe what they want. The government did plan to make an amendment to the Constitution, but that would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. The president is pushing for this amendment because of his own personal beliefs as a Catholic. He is showing that he prefers one religion over others. This is not right. The church should decide what it wants to do, not the government.\n\nThere is no good reason for an amendment to ban this. It will not help the economy. It might even help society in some way.\n\nI have said all I need to say.",
            "The war in Iraq was a serious problem. The American government did not tell the truth about why it started the war. They said it was because of the terrorist attacks on September 11th. However, that was not the real reason.\n\nMany people do not like war. I am one of them. I think it is never a good idea to start a war just to be safe. In 2003, the United States invaded Iraq without a good reason.\n\nThis war was very similar to the Vietnam War. The US government wanted to remove the government of Iraq and make a new one. But they did not think about what would happen after the war. Many American soldiers died in the war. It was a sad and tragic thing.\n\nThe US government said it would be easy to make Iraq a democracy. But it was not that easy. It takes a long time to build a new government. The US government did not think about this before the war. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nThe war in Iraq is difficult to end. If we start a war, we must think about what will happen after. We must be prepared for all possible outcomes. The US government was not prepared for the problems in Iraq.\n\nMany American soldiers are still in Iraq and many are dying. The US government is trying to teach the Iraqi people how to govern themselves. But it is a long and hard process. I think the US government made a mistake by going to war. They did not tell the truth about their reasons. They made it seem like it would be an easy job. But it was not.\n\nIt is hard to decide what to do in a situation like this. If we go to war, we must finish what we start. But we must also think about the cost. Many American soldiers have died in the war. Is it worth it? I am not sure.\n\nOne of the reasons we went to war with Iraq was to get their oil. Oil is a very important resource. I think the US government was not honest about its reasons for the war. They said it was to make Iraq a democracy, but that was not true.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon and there will be peace. But I do not think it will be easy.",
            "I am for gay marriage.  I have always been.  I believe it is a personal preference and not something that people should be judged for.  Many studies have shown that being gay is not chosen, but rather something that people are born with.\n\nI do not think that government should decide who can and cannot get married.  Marriage is a personal choice between two people, not something that should be controlled by the state.  In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who live normal lives and contribute to our community just like anyone else.\n\nPresident Bush's decision to limit gay marriage is wrong.  Marriage is not something that he or anyone else should be able to decide.  I believe it is ridiculous for him to try to control what is a personal choice.\n\nMany studies have shown that being gay is not a choice, but rather something that people are born with.  It is not something that people can change, and it is not something that they should be ashamed of.  I believe that people should be free to make their own choices about who they love and who they want to marry.\n\nMarriage is a personal choice between two people, and it should not be controlled by the government.  If a man and a woman want to get married, they can do it privately without anyone knowing.  But if two men or two women want to get married, it is a different story.\n\nI believe that gay marriage should be a personal choice and not something that is decided by the government.  It is a private matter that should not be made public.",
            "You cannot put something on the internet that is not true. The internet is a public place. Anything you put there is seen by many people. When you are friends with someone on Myspace or Facebook, you can see their messages. But this does not mean that the school can look at your private messages. The school can only act on something if someone tells them about it. They cannot ignore it or do nothing.\n\nIt can be hard to know what to believe. Some people only joke around on the internet. It could be like a school project that went wrong. Or it could be something very serious.\n\nSomething like this happened at our school. Someone overheard a student saying something and told the school. We found out it was not true, but it was on the student's Facebook page. The school got worried because it looked like he meant it. When you put something on the internet, you have no control over who sees it. If you don't want people to know something, don't put it on the internet.\n\nSchool officials should not be friends with students on the internet. They should not look at their pages or messages. If a student's friend tells the school something, it's not an invasion of privacy. The school has to act on it if there is danger. They should not listen to phone calls or texts without a good reason.\n\nA teacher should not make a secret account on the internet to be friends with students. This is not right. It's not fair to the students. The teacher should not know things about them that they don't want to share.",
            "I think the war has gone too long. \n\nThe purpose of the war was good at first. We wanted to bring democracy to a country that did not have a fair government. But now, it seems like the main reason for the war is just to show that we are a powerful country.\n\nI also think the original reasons for the war were not clear. We were influenced by past events, like problems between the United States and Iraq. If we were fighting for democracy, it would be a good reason. But if there were personal reasons involved, it would not be good.\n\nI believe we made our point in the first few months. Starting the war was a strong statement. But the war has gone on for many years. This is too long.\n\nIf our purpose was to bring democracy to a country ruled by a bad leader, it would be a good reason for war. But I think our reason has changed over time. We are now fighting just to fight.\n\nThe war has gone on too long. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We are spending a lot of money on the war. This money could be used to solve problems in our own country, like poverty and poor public services.\n\nWe should stop the war. We have our own problems to solve. We should use our money to make our country better, not to fight a war that we no longer believe in.\n\nWe are spending too much money on the war. War should not be in our long-term budget. We have many problems in our country that need our attention, like health care and education.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I have a question about something. It is true that people can see information on the internet. This is because when you put something online, it can be seen by many people. If you have a profile on a website, you allow others to see it when you add them as friends. \n\nHowever, it is difficult to have someone watch all students in school to prevent bad things. This could be unfair to some students. It is also not right to look at everyone's profiles just to find something wrong with them.\n\nPeople are worried about strangers seeing their personal information online. For example, someone on TV showed how easy it is to get information about someone on the internet. He found a girl's screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in just a minute. You can also put pictures, class schedules, and other information on the internet. It can be hard to decide how much to share because you want to keep in touch with your friends.\n\nYou can limit what you put online, but you never know who can see it. My friend's high school did not allow students to have Myspace accounts. This made me wonder if the school had the right to tell students what to do online.",
            "I am a little confused. We have a lot to talk about, including the Iraq War. I do not want to be part of the group of people who always say they were against the war from the start. But, I was against it. However, it does not matter much now. Most people agree that the war was not a good idea. In fact, almost eighty percent of people around the world think this way. Even many U.S. soldiers serving in Iraq think the war was a bad idea and we should leave within a year.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was bad before we arrived. It was a disaster. Now, leaving is also a difficult problem. There is a big difference in culture between the United States and countries in the Middle East. This makes it hard for us to understand each other. We must respect how other people want to live their lives.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we should have thought carefully before invading Iraq. We must weigh the good and bad results of our actions. The war has been a disaster, like quicksand that pulls us down.\n\nI do not see a good reason for us to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may think there are good reasons to stay, but I do not agree. I do not see a reason why we should not leave now. Many Iraqis think the same way. They say we should leave within a year. We are trying to help them, but they are telling us to leave.\n\nIf we ask the Iraqis if they want us to leave, and they say yes, we cannot blame them if things go badly. If we decide to help them later, we will at least be seen as trying to do the right thing. Maybe we will never be seen as good guys in the Middle East, but it will be better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem called gender bias in the United States. It is not just about men and women. The kind of work you do also makes a difference. \n\nFor women, it can be harder to succeed because of a thing called the glass ceiling. Even though there should be equality, it is hard for women to find jobs where they can be in charge. This is because of the way society has been for a long time. In the past, men have been in charge. \n\nIn many workplaces, women may have the qualifications for a job, but they may not get it because of their gender. It is the same for men in some industries, like fashion. \n\nSometimes, people do not take men seriously if they are into fashion. They may think that men who like fashion are not normal. \n\nThe same thing happens with men who stay at home to raise their children. Society does not expect men to do this, and it can be hard for them. \n\nBut things are changing. More and more women are getting important jobs, and people are starting to accept this. Men who stay at home are also becoming more accepted. \n\nWe need to promote people who are different and show their good qualities. If we do this in a gentle way, people will accept it. We have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. \n\nWe also have a problem with people from different places being judged. If someone from a farm has poor grammar but is very smart, they may have trouble getting ahead because of where they come from. \n\nThis is another example of discrimination. It can be between men and women, or it can be between people from different places. \n\nI do not know what the solution is, but we need to keep working on it.",
            "I think they made marijuana a less serious crime. They changed it from a crime that gets you arrested to a ticket you get for something like a traffic ticket. This means that you don't have to be arrested and taken to jail. But, even if it's no longer a serious crime, some people worry about the future problems it can cause. These problems can affect things like job interviews and other important situations.\n\nSome people think it costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for their lawyers. This is true, especially for small cities that don't have much money. That's why some cities don't want to make marijuana a less serious crime, even if it would save them money.\n\nBut in some cities, like Denver, people are more open-minded. They think it's okay to make marijuana less serious. This means the city can use the money it saves to help people, like children, the elderly, and those who are homeless.\n\nI think it's a good idea to make marijuana less serious. It's not something that should be everywhere, and there are good reasons for that. Also, making it less serious can save money for cities.\n\nOne problem with making it totally legal is that people might smoke it and drive cars. This is not safe. Also, in some places, smoking marijuana is still not accepted. If it's out in the open, it might be uncomfortable for some people.\n\nAlcohol can be more dangerous than marijuana because it affects your driving skills. But marijuana can still have bad effects on people's lifestyles. How people react to substances is different. Some people are careful and don't have problems, while others do.\n\nIt's hard to say how marijuana affects people because everyone reacts differently. But I do think both marijuana and alcohol have their own problems.",
            "I agree. Here's why:\n\nThe Catholic Church has many old customs that have been done for a long time. Some are good, but it is also important to change when necessary. Many Catholics go to church every week. They are very strict about how things are done. Sometimes, I feel like the Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules perfectly. They do not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. They also do not accept people from other religions. For example, my parents' religions were different. They could not get married in the Catholic Church because my father was not Catholic.\n\nI do not think this is fair. We are taught to love others, which is a basic Catholic rule. It is hypocritical to say to love others and then not accept them. I think the Catholic Church's teachings and its practices do not match.\n\nI do not think my own opinion on this would influence me. I think it would be good if priests could get married, but it would not stop them from behaving badly. Some people would harm children, even if they were married. This is because they are harming children, not because they are single or married.\n\nThe Church should be fair and accept people from all religions. They should also be careful with the people they choose to be priests. This is because priests have a lot of power and influence.",
            "This is a very difficult subject. I am not sure what to think. Two things are very important here: government and church rules. One is about marriage and how it is defined. It is hard to decide on this issue without hurting anyone's feelings.\n\nMarriage is a very special thing. It is between two people. But it is also a union of two people. It is like a partnership. The government should not decide what kind of marriage it is. This is because the government and church are separate.\n\nIf two people get married, they should be treated the same. They should not be looked at differently because of their marriage. They should get the same rights and taxes.\n\nThe question of gay marriage is also important. Two people love each other, and they want to be together. They should be able to get married and be treated the same as other couples.\n\nIf many states agree on this issue, it should be made into a federal law. But changing the constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The constitution should not be changed for a small issue like this.\n\nIt is not important enough to change the constitution. We should not make a big deal out of it.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. For me, homosexuality is a complicated issue. I have many gay friends, and this makes me think carefully about the subject. I do not agree with the idea, but I believe it should be legal. I do not think it's a national issue. Instead, I think each state should make its own decision.\n\nIf a state is democratic, it will probably support gay marriage. If you live in that state, you will know how it feels about this issue. I don't think you should disagree with the state's decision. You chose to live there, so you should respect its choice.\n\nI believe homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. I think each state should decide whether to legalize gay marriage.\n\nI already answered this question. This is my opinion.\n\nI don't think President Bush should decide for the whole country what to do about gay marriage. I believe each state should decide for itself. I disagree with his decision to ban gay marriage.\n\nI just think that the president should not make decisions for every state. He does not live in every state, so he cannot know what is best for each one. Some things should be left up to each individual state.\n\nThe president will not be in office for much longer. If a new president decides to change the ban on gay marriage, it will just go back and forth. I think each state should make its own decision. They will have to live with the choice, not the president.\n\nNo, I do not have the answer to that question.",
            "I do not think school officials are wrong to look at student posts on Myspace. When you put something on the internet, it is like posting it in a public place. Everyone can see it, including school officials. They can find it even if it is not under the school's name.\n\nIf school officials look at Myspace to prevent a school shooting, I think it is okay. Keeping students safe is the school's job. They should do what they can to make the school a safe place.\n\nSome school officials look at Myspace to see if students are doing things they should not be doing. They go on the internet to catch students who are breaking the rules. I think this is not right. It is an invasion of privacy. But if it helps make the school safer, I think it is okay.\n\nIt is easy to express yourself more when you are writing than when you are talking. When you post something on Myspace, you should think about what could happen. Once something is on the internet, it is always there. It can hurt you in the future.\n\nIf you do something bad when you are a student, it can come back and hurt you when you are older and important. You should think about this before you post something on the internet.\n\nI do not think school officials should go on Myspace just to catch students. But if they have a good reason to look, like to make the school safer, it is okay. Parents trust the school to be a safe place for their children. I think school officials are just trying to do their job.\n\nWhen I went to school, we had drills to prepare for a school shooting. We practiced what to do if someone came into the building. The school officials were trying to keep us safe. I think they are doing the same thing now by looking at Myspace.\n\nThey were trying to prevent something bad from happening, like a school shooting. They were just doing their job to keep the school a safe place.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. I was affected by the September 11 attacks. I wanted to help. I thought we should go to another country and show them what we can do. But I now think we made a mistake.\n\nWe went to war without a good plan. We were angry and wanted revenge. I think we should have thought about the long-term effects. We didn't consider the people we were helping. They were busy fighting with each other.\n\nI don't think it's our job to help them. If they can't work together, we can't make a difference. I don't care what happens there anymore. I think the people there are fighting for themselves, not for a better country.\n\nWar is different for them than it is for us. They are not interested in improving their country; they want us to leave. I think we should do that. We went to war on impulse, without thinking. We were looking for revenge, not a solution.\n\nThe president wanted to go to war because the people wanted it. But he should have had a better plan. He should have thought about what we would do there. We didn't have a clear goal. We didn't work together. We just went to war.\n\nI don't think we can change them. They are the way they are. We can't stay there forever. We are hurting ourselves by staying. Once we leave, their country will fall apart. We should not be there.\n\nI think we made a big mistake. We didn't think about what would happen. We were too angry. I don't think we should be in that country anymore."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They are losing followers because they are not very accepting of many things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they are a little old-fashioned. If they adapted to more modern thinking, they might not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They see the Church as having the wrong view on many things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it and want to practice it, you might not want to be in a Church that doesn't agree.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work, but everyone else has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nIf priests were allowed to be married or if there were female priests, it might not have changed the situation. However, it's hard to know for sure. What I do know is that many people are unhappy with the Catholic Church's views on these issues.",

They are who they are.\n\nIt's not a choice, like being straight or left-handed. People are born that way. They should not be punished for their sexual orientation.\n\nThe federal government should not be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter. It's not a matter of national security or morality. They should not judge people for who they are.\n\nGay people should be treated with respect and kindness. They should not be hurt or punished for something they cannot change.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people believe that gay couples are a threat to the straight family. But that's not true. Their relationships are different, and that's okay. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads and tails are different, but they are still the same coin.\n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should be able to own property and get medical care. If a gay partner is sick, the other partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is a basic right.\n\nScientific studies show that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful. They love each other and work together.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. This is a civil right, not a church matter.\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. If the government allows civil unions, why not marriage?\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people are concerned about children of gay couples. But this is a small issue. Children of gay couples are just like children of straight couples. They need love and support, not a label.\n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should support this.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views about gay marriage. But his views are based on his religion. This is not fair. The government should not enforce one group's morality on everyone else.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts, not just popular opinion. If we do, we might see things differently.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. \n\nSome people think that just because a medicine is illegal, it is not helpful. I do not agree. \n\nI think it is not a good idea to make a medicine available to the public if it is illegal. No, I do not think it is a good idea. However, I do think it is okay to use a medicine for medical reasons, even if it is illegal. \n\nThere are medicines that are illegal but still helpful. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are all controlled substances. We use them in the pharmacy because they are helpful. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because it is illegal, that is not fair. \n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause harm. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause harm. It is a difficult question. I think we should be able to use marijuana responsibly. We can do this by allowing it to become legal gradually, not all at once. \n\nIf we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly. They might use it for medical reasons, which is a good thing. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress and matching shoes and purse. I attended a private school with my friends. We saw each other every weekend.\n\nNow, the church has made changes. They now have a \"teenager mass\" that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually during the summer. They even wear beach clothes right after the beach. Families are often late for morning masses. People wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up.\n\nThe biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. That is the main thing about the church I know. I do not know about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations of priests abusing children, I do not think these problems could have been avoided by changing the church's rules, such as allowing married priests or priests to marry. Some people who are married still abuse children. Their behavior is not because of their marital status.\n\nIt is also a person's choice to become a priest. There are other religions that allow married people to be clergy. They can still practice their faith and be married. If they want to do both, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think abuse is based on genetics. People are born with these feelings. Their upbringing may play a small part, but it is mostly their genetics. You cannot hide this through marriage. It would usually come out eventually. I do not think the church could have prevented this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that is a serious issue. However, I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. The United States went to war in Iraq after the September 11th attacks in 2001. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. Colin Powell, who was a high official, later said that he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations. This is very bad behavior for a government official.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution and tried to limit its power. They wanted to go to war, but the Constitution says that the government must have a good reason to go to war.\n\nSome people think that President Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's old problems with Saddam Hussein. Bush also wanted to get more oil from Iraq.\n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there might be more problems and more people might die. The US and other countries are trying to work together to help Iraq, but it is not working well. The government in Iraq is not strong and has many problems.\n\nI do not know what to say about this situation. I do not think that the US should have gone to war, but now we cannot just leave.",
            "I have some thoughts about the War in Iraq.\n\nFirst, I am not clear about the situation. I don't know the details. I think the war was not officially declared by the US government. It was a reaction to the attacks on the United States on September 11.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to stay in Iraq. Many people are unhappy about the war. We are using a lot of resources, and it's making a difficult situation worse. \n\nI also think about the Vietnam War. It was an undeclared war, and it's now considered a meaningless war. I don't want the same thing to happen with the War in Iraq.\n\nBut, I also think about the people in Iraq who have families and lives. They are suffering because of the war. We should consider their feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to say what I think. I think we should leave Iraq, but I also think about the families who have loved ones there. If we leave, they will be unhappy, but if we stay, we will be changing their culture and making their lives worse.\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is.

            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law against a church. The constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It is a clear statement in the constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make a law against a church are choosing one church's ideas over another. Most Catholics and Christians don't want this law. But some people in Boston and other places support it.\n\nI don't think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States.\n\nEven if the government wanted to make an amendment to the constitution, I think it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written. And it would be one of the only amendments to take away people's rights rather than limit the government's power.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president's decision to push for this amendment seems to be based on his own Catholic beliefs. He wants one religion to be treated better than others.\n\nIt is up to the churches to decide what they want to do, not the government. There is no good reason for the amendment, except that the president thinks it's a good idea. It won't help the economy, but it might make society better.\n\nI have said all I want to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq happened in 2003. Many Americans did not agree with the reasons the government gave for the war. They thought the government was not honest about the reasons for going to war. The government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war. I do not think the US government was ready for the consequences of war. Many American soldiers died in Iraq. This is very sad. The US removed the government of Iraq. But they did not plan well for the future.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government. They wanted to put a new government in place. But they did not think about the problems that would come after. The US is still in Iraq now. Many Americans are still dying. The US is trying to help the Iraqi military and police learn to control their country.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war in Iraq would be easy to win. But it is not easy to create a democracy. It took many years for the US to become a democratic country. The US government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for President Bush. One reason was that I thought he should finish what he started. But now I am not sure. The US is still in Iraq after a long time. We took away their government and way of life. Should we leave now? That is a difficult question.\n\nThe US is risking many American lives in Iraq. Is it worth it? We went to war for a free democratic Iraq. But why not for other countries? I think it is really about oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being attacked. The US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I am not sure that will happen.",
            "I think gay marriage is right. I have always thought so. This is a personal matter. Many experts now say that a person's sexual preference is not their choice. It is in their body. They cannot change it.\n\nThe government should not control this. It is not a state issue. It is a personal and family matter. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married. But they behave like other families. They take care of their dogs and go for walks.\n\nThe President of the United States is trying to decide what marriage is. This is not his job. It is not right for him to decide.\n\nExperts say that some people are born gay. It may be because of a chemical in their brain. It is not because of how they are raised. For example, if a boy has many sisters and no father, it does not make him gay.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to marry, they can do it in secret. But if two gay people want to marry, it is a public issue.\n\nThis should be a private matter, not a matter for the government or the country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Anyone can see it. This is very important to remember. As a resident advisor, I have seen this happen before. \n\nWhen you post something online, it can affect people's opinions about you. If you talk about something bad, like violence, someone will share it. The internet is open to everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you may see what they post.\n\nThis can be a problem. Schools may find out about something you posted. They cannot ignore it because they have to keep everyone safe. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it is also hard to know what to believe. Some people just make jokes online. For example, maybe someone in a class did an experiment that went wrong on purpose. Or it could be a real problem.\n\nRecently, something happened at our school. Someone overheard someone talking about something, and they reported it. We found out who the person was, and we looked at their Facebook page. There were things on there that they meant as jokes, but they were taken seriously. \n\nWhen you post things online, it is like sharing them with everyone. You cannot control who sees them. If you don't want someone to know something, don't share it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want to think.\n\nSchool officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not read their private messages either. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I think it's best not to connect with my residents online.

We started the war to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair system. But now, the war has gone on for many years. This is a long time.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. But I'm not sure that's still our goal. It seems we're just fighting because we want to fight.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we're helping will have to take care of itself soon. We should stop spending a lot of money on this war. We have problems in our own country that we should be solving, like poverty and poor schools.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war. This money could be used to fix problems in our own country. We need to spend our money on things that help our own citizens, like health care and roads.\n\nI think we should stop the war because it's costly and not solving the problem we started with. We should focus on helping our own country instead.",
            "You have a question. You think it's good that someone stopped something bad from happening because they looked at someone's information on the internet. This is on websites like Myspace or Facebook. If you put information on the internet, it's likely many people will see it. You can control who sees your information by accepting them as friends, but this means you are giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's hard to control who sees information on the internet. One person can't look at everyone's profiles all the time. But if someone is looking at many profiles to prevent bad things from happening, it might be unfair. They might think only certain people are bad.\n\nYou have a Facebook account and it bothers you that strangers can see things about you. You saw a TV show about a man who easily got information about someone online. He got their screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in just a minute. This is why you limit what you put on Facebook, but you also want to stay in touch with friends.\n\nMany people worry about this issue. Your roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. But you're not sure if this is right. Can schools tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "I am not sure about the Iraq War. It was a difficult decision. I do not like talking about it. Many people think it was a bad idea. Most people around the world do not agree with the decision to go to war. About 75 to 80 percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and other countries think the war was a bad idea.\n\nMost U.S. soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea. They want to leave Iraq within a year. The country was already in trouble when the U.S. went in. Now it is hard to leave. There is a big difference between American culture and the culture in the Middle East. It is hard to bring democracy to countries where people want to make their own choices.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad ruler, but the U.S. should have thought about the consequences before going to war. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It is hard to get out. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may have some ideas for staying, but I do not agree with them.\n\nIf the U.S. leaves Iraq slowly over time, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should. Many Iraqis want the U.S. to leave within a year. Some want the U.S. to leave now. These are the people we are trying to help.\n\nI think it is better to do what Iraqis want. If they tell us to leave, then it is not our responsibility if things go badly. If we decide to help them after they ask us to leave, we can be seen as trying to help. It is not easy to be seen as the good guy in the Middle East. But it is better than where we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem is called gender discrimination.\n\nIn the US, women have an especially hard time. They often face a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from getting to the top of their jobs. Even when they have all the qualifications for a job, they may not get promoted because society has not seen many women in leadership positions in the past.\n\nThe same thing can happen to men in certain jobs, like in the fashion industry. People may not take them seriously if they are not like other men in the fashion industry. This can be because men in the fashion industry have different styles of life.\n\nIn many areas, men are expected to be the main earners of a family. If a man stays home to take care of the children, people may think it's strange. This can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they are straight. They may think men who like fashion are not like other men.\n\nTo change this, we need to work slowly and carefully. We have made a lot of progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. As women get more jobs and become CEOs, people are starting to accept them more. The same is happening with men who stay home to take care of their children.\n\nThe key is to show people the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped. We should not push people to accept things too quickly. If we do, they will resist. Instead, we should show them the good qualities of these people, and they will start to accept them more.\n\nWe are at a good point right now, where people are starting to accept things more. However, we still have a long way to go. There are many areas where people are still discriminated against, not just because of their gender, but also because of where they are from or how they speak.\n\nFor example, people from rural areas may be looked down upon if they have poor grammar, even if they are very intelligent. This is another form of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a big problem in the US. We need to work slowly and carefully to fix it. We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "Marijuana was once against the law. But it's not anymore in some places. It's now like a traffic ticket. You get a fine instead of going to jail. \n\nThis change can be good or bad. Some people think it's good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people and put them in jail. It also costs money for the court and lawyers. \n\nDenver is a place where people are more open-minded. They think it's fine to have marijuana. They use the money to help the community. They spend it on schools, programs for older people, and food for those who are poor.\n\nBut some people don't think it's a good idea. They think it will make problems. There will be people smoking and driving. It's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. It will be awkward for a lot of people if it's everywhere.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana are both bad for people. But in different ways. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can hurt your lifestyle. It can make you make bad choices.\n\nPeople react differently to substances. Some people can handle them easily. Others can't. It's hard to say how marijuana will affect someone.\n\nBut both marijuana and alcohol can hurt people. They both have bad effects. It's good to be careful with them.",
            "I agree. \nWhy \nUm \nMany things they do are very traditional. \nFor a long time, they have done things the same way. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be open to change. \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nAnd \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes \nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nAnd \nIt does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nAnd \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nUm \nFor example \nMy mom was Episcopalian. \nNo \nI am sorry. \nMy dad was Episcopalian. \nMy mom was Catholic. \nThey would not marry my parents in the Catholic Church. \nBecause of my dad’s religion. \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat is not really \nLike \nBeing kind to others. \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others. \nThat is a Catholic teaching. \nBut \nIt is hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. \nSo \nI feel the Catholic doctrine says to do things. \nBut the Catholic practice is different. \nBecause it is old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway. \n\nUm \nI do not think that would necessarily be a reason to change. \nI mean \nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. \nBut \nAs \nI do not think that would necessarily stop them from being unkind to children. \nSo \nBecause it is a different situation \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably do not think that would be a problem \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who hurt children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they have a \nSpouse or not. \nBecause children are different from spouses. \nSo if you are going to do something bad \nYou are probably going to do it anyway. \nLike \nI do not think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose bad things from happening \nI think that would probably happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made up my mind. I do not know if one side is right or the other. This is a difficult subject. It is about the relationship between church and state. It is also about how we define marriage. This is hard to do without hurting someone’s feelings.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people. It is not just a sacrament. People should not get special treatment from the government just because they were baptized. If people are married, the government should not look at it as a religious thing. They should look at it as a civil union.\n\nTwo people who love each other should be able to make a union. They should not be judged. The fact that some people are gay is not important. They can also make a union.\n\nIf the states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But making a change to the constitution is too big a deal. It should not be changed just to ban gay marriage. This is not a big enough issue to make a change to the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to make a change to the constitution. We should not change the constitution just to define marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This made me think about my views on homosexuality. I do not fully understand this issue. I have many gay friends, and I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Each state should make its own decision about this.\n\nI think if you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that state's decision. You chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be allowed in each state.\n\nI have already answered this question. I do not agree with President Bush's decision to ban gay marriage. He should not make decisions for all the states. I do not think he should decide how each state should be governed. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will leave office soon. If a new president is elected, he may change the law on gay marriage. I think each state should make its own decision about this issue. They will have to live with the decision.\n\nNo, I am not a supporter of President Bush on this issue.",
            "I do not agree that the school officials overstepped their bounds. Myspace is a public place. If you put something on the internet, you should be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. They have the right to check Myspace to make sure students are safe. They can do this from their homes.\n\nThe school officials went on Myspace to prevent school shootings. Saving students' lives is a big responsibility of the school system. I think it is okay to check Myspace if it helps keep students safe.\n\nSome people might think it is an invasion of privacy to check Myspace. But if it makes the school a better and safer place, I do not think it is an invasion. \n\nWhen you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to be private. Many people post things they do not want others to see. But once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it off. \n\nThe school officials can find things you post on Myspace even if it is not under the school's name. They can use the internet to find out what students are doing.\n\nIf the school officials can use Myspace to make the school safer, I think it is okay. They should not just go on Myspace to catch students doing something wrong. \n\nOne teacher told me that schools must make sure students are safe. We have to do drills in case of emergencies. This is to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to make the school safer. They were checking Myspace to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to cause trouble for those who hurt us. However, I now think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term results of our actions. We went into the war without a clear plan.\n\nThings did not go well. We did not prepare well for the challenges we faced. War is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a savage way. They are not trying to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war to get revenge. The president decided to go to war because many people wanted to. We couldn't just ignore what happened and leave it alone. However, we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and didn't know what we were doing. We created more problems than we solved. I don't think we are the ones to change them. They will always be the same.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough to stay. It will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should not stay there forever."

you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They are losing followers because they are not very accepting of many things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they are a little old-fashioned. If they adapted to more modern thinking, they might not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They see the Church as having the wrong view on many things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it and want to practice it, you might not want to be in a Church that doesn't agree.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work, but everyone else has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nIf priests were allowed to be married or if there were female priests, it might not have changed the situation. However, it's hard to know for sure. What I do know is that many people are unhappy with the Catholic Church's views on these issues.",
            "I think gay marriage is okay. I believe people are born gay. They don't choose to be gay. I think they should not be blamed for who they are.\n\nI don't think it's right to say same-sex couples can't get married. It's not their choice. They are who they are.\n\nIt's not a choice, like being straight or left-handed. People are born that way. They should not be punished for their sexual orientation.\n\nThe federal government should not be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter. It's not a matter of national security or morality. They should not judge people for who they are.\n\nGay people should be treated with respect and kindness. They should not be hurt or punished for something they cannot change.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people believe that gay couples are a threat to the straight family. But that's not true. Their relationships are different, and that's okay. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads and tails are different, but they are still the same coin.\n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should be able to own property and get medical care. If a gay partner is sick, the other partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is a basic right.\n\nScientific studies show that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful. They love each other and work together.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. This is a civil right, not a church matter.\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. If the government allows civil unions, why not marriage?\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people are concerned about children of gay couples. But this is a small issue. Children of gay couples are just like children of straight couples. They need love and support, not a label.\n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should support this.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views about gay marriage. But his views are based on his religion. This is not fair. The government should not enforce one group's morality on everyone else.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts, not just popular opinion. If we do, we might see things differently.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. \n\nSome people think that just because a medicine is illegal, it is not helpful. I do not agree. \n\nI think it is not a good idea to make a medicine available to the public if it is illegal. No, I do not think it is a good idea. However, I do think it is okay to use a medicine for medical reasons, even if it is illegal. \n\nThere are medicines that are illegal but still helpful. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are all controlled substances. We use them in the pharmacy because they are helpful. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because it is illegal, that is not fair. \n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause harm. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause harm. It is a difficult question. I think we should be able to use marijuana responsibly. We can do this by allowing it to become legal gradually, not all at once. \n\nIf we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly. They might use it for medical reasons, which is a good thing. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress and matching shoes and purse. I attended a private school with my friends. We saw each other every weekend.\n\nNow, the church has made changes. They now have a \"teenager mass\" that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually during the summer. They even wear beach clothes right after the beach. Families are often late for morning masses. People wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up.\n\nThe biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. That is the main thing about the church I know. I do not know about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations of priests abusing children, I do not think these problems could have been avoided by changing the church's rules, such as allowing married priests or priests to marry. Some people who are married still abuse children. Their behavior is not because of their marital status.\n\nIt is also a person's choice to become a priest. There are other religions that allow married people to be clergy. They can still practice their faith and be married. If they want to do both, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think abuse is based on genetics. People are born with these feelings. Their upbringing may play a small part, but it is mostly their genetics. You cannot hide this through marriage. It would usually come out eventually. I do not think the church could have prevented this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that is a serious issue. However, I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. The United States went to war in Iraq after the September 11th attacks in 2001. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. Colin Powell, who was a high official, later said that he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations. This is very bad behavior for a government official.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution and tried to limit its power. They wanted to go to war, but the Constitution says that the government must have a good reason to go to war.\n\nSome people think that President Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's old problems with Saddam Hussein. Bush also wanted to get more oil from Iraq.\n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there might be more problems and more people might die. The US and other countries are trying to work together to help Iraq, but it is not working well. The government in Iraq is not strong and has many problems.\n\nI do not know what to say about this situation. I do not think that the US should have gone to war, but now we cannot just leave.",
            "I have some thoughts about the War in Iraq.\n\nFirst, I am not clear about the situation. I don't know the details. I think the war was not officially declared by the US government. It was a reaction to the attacks on the United States on September 11.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to stay in Iraq. Many people are unhappy about the war. We are using a lot of resources, and it's making a difficult situation worse. \n\nI also think about the Vietnam War. It was an undeclared war, and it's now considered a meaningless war. I don't want the same thing to happen with the War in Iraq.\n\nBut, I also think about the people in Iraq who have families and lives. They are suffering because of the war. We should consider their feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to say what I think. I think we should leave Iraq, but I also think about the families who have loved ones there. If we leave, they will be unhappy, but if we stay, we will be changing their culture and making their lives worse.\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is. I think this situation will continue for a long time.",
            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law against a church. The constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It is a clear statement in the constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make a law against a church are choosing one church's ideas over another. Most Catholics and Christians don't want this law. But some people in Boston and other places support it.\n\nI don't think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States.\n\nEven if the government wanted to make an amendment to the constitution, I think it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written. And it would be one of the only amendments to take away people's rights rather than limit the government's power.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president's decision to push for this amendment seems to be based on his own Catholic beliefs. He wants one religion to be treated better than others.\n\nIt is up to the churches to decide what they want to do, not the government. There is no good reason for the amendment, except that the president thinks it's a good idea. It won't help the economy, but it might make society better.\n\nI have said all I want to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq happened in 2003. Many Americans did not agree with the reasons the government gave for the war. They thought the government was not honest about the reasons for going to war. The government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war. I do not think the US government was ready for the consequences of war. Many American soldiers died in Iraq. This is very sad. The US removed the government of Iraq. But they did not plan well for the future.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government. They wanted to put a new government in place. But they did not think about the problems that would come after. The US is still in Iraq now. Many Americans are still dying. The US is trying to help the Iraqi military and police learn to control their country.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war in Iraq would be easy to win. But it is not easy to create a democracy. It took many years for the US to become a democratic country. The US government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for President Bush. One reason was that I thought he should finish what he started. But now I am not sure. The US is still in Iraq after a long time. We took away their government and way of life. Should we leave now? That is a difficult question.\n\nThe US is risking many American lives in Iraq. Is it worth it? We went to war for a free democratic Iraq. But why not for other countries? I think it is really about oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being attacked. The US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I am not sure that will happen.",
            "I think gay marriage is right. I have always thought so. This is a personal matter. Many experts now say that a person's sexual preference is not their choice. It is in their body. They cannot change it.\n\nThe government should not control this. It is not a state issue. It is a personal and family matter. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married. But they behave like other families. They take care of their dogs and go for walks.\n\nThe President of the United States is trying to decide what marriage is. This is not his job. It is not right for him to decide.\n\nExperts say that some people are born gay. It may be because of a chemical in their brain. It is not because of how they are raised. For example, if a boy has many sisters and no father, it does not make him gay.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to marry, they can do it in secret. But if two gay people want to marry, it is a public issue.\n\nThis should be a private matter, not a matter for the government or the country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Anyone can see it. This is very important to remember. As a resident advisor, I have seen this happen before. \n\nWhen you post something online, it can affect people's opinions about you. If you talk about something bad, like violence, someone will share it. The internet is open to everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you may see what they post.\n\nThis can be a problem. Schools may find out about something you posted. They cannot ignore it because they have to keep everyone safe. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it is also hard to know what to believe. Some people just make jokes online. For example, maybe someone in a class did an experiment that went wrong on purpose. Or it could be a real problem.\n\nRecently, something happened at our school. Someone overheard someone talking about something, and they reported it. We found out who the person was, and we looked at their Facebook page. There were things on there that they meant as jokes, but they were taken seriously. \n\nWhen you post things online, it is like sharing them with everyone. You cannot control who sees them. If you don't want someone to know something, don't share it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want to think.\n\nSchool officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not read their private messages either. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I think it's best not to connect with my residents online.

            "I have a problem with the way the war has been going on for such a long time. I think the original goal was good - to help another country have a fair government. But now, I'm not sure the reason for the war is clear. We may be fighting just to show our power.\n\nI think the war started for a good reason. We wanted to help a country with an unfair government. However, I'm not sure this is still the main reason we're fighting. Maybe we started for personal reasons, like to prove something. \n\nI think we already made our point in the beginning. We started the war to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair system. But now, the war has gone on for many years. This is a long time.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. But I'm not sure that's still our goal. It seems we're just fighting because we want to fight.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we're helping will have to take care of itself soon. We should stop spending a lot of money on this war. We have problems in our own country that we should be solving, like poverty and poor schools.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war. This money could be used to fix problems in our own country. We need to spend our money on things that help our own citizens, like health care and roads.\n\nI think we should stop the war because it's costly and not solving the problem we started with. We should focus on helping our own country instead.",
            "You have a question. You think it's good that someone stopped something bad from happening because they looked at someone's information on the internet.

You can control who sees your information by accepting them as friends, but this means you are giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's hard to control who sees information on the internet. One person can't look at everyone's profiles all the time. But if someone is looking at many profiles to prevent bad things from happening, it might be unfair. They might think only certain people are bad.\n\nYou have a Facebook account and it bothers you that strangers can see things about you. You saw a TV show about a man who easily got information about someone online. He got their screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in just a minute. This is why you limit what you put on Facebook, but you also want to stay in touch with friends.\n\nMany people worry about this issue. Your roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. But you're not sure if this is right. Can schools tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "I am not sure about the Iraq War. It was a difficult decision. I do not like talking about it. Many people think it was a bad idea. Most people around the world do not agree with the decision to go to war. About 75 to 80 percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and other countries think the war was a bad idea.\n\nMost U.S. soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea. They want to leave Iraq within a year. The country was already in trouble when the U.S. went in. Now it is hard to leave. There is a big difference between American culture and the culture in the Middle East. It is hard to bring democracy to countries where people want to make their own choices.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad ruler, but the U.S. should have thought about the consequences before going to war. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It is hard to get out. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may have some ideas for staying, but I do not agree with them.\n\nIf the U.S. leaves Iraq slowly over time, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should. Many Iraqis want the U.S. to leave within a year. Some want the U.S. to leave now. These are the people we are trying to help.\n\nI think it is better to do what Iraqis want. If they tell us to leave, then it is not our responsibility if things go badly. If we decide to help them after they ask us to leave, we can be seen as trying to help. It is not easy to be seen as the good guy in the Middle East. But it is better than where we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem is called gender discrimination.\n\nIn the US, women have an especially hard time. They often face a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from getting to the top of their jobs. Even when they have all the qualifications for a job, they may not get promoted because society has not seen many women in leadership positions in the past.\n\nThe same thing can happen to men in certain jobs, like in the fashion industry. People may not take them seriously if they are not like other men in the fashion industry. This can be because men in the fashion industry have different styles of life.\n\nIn many areas, men are expected to be the main earners of a family. If a man stays home to take care of the children, people may think it's strange. This can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they are straight. They may think men who like fashion are not like other men.\n\nTo change this, we need to work slowly and carefully. We have made a lot of progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. As women get more jobs and become CEOs, people are starting to accept them more. The same is happening with men who stay home to take care of their children.\n\nThe key is to show people the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped. We should not push people to accept things too quickly. If we do, they will resist. Instead, we should show them the good qualities of these people, and they will start to accept them more.\n\nWe are at a good point right now, where people are starting to accept things more. However, we still have a long way to go. There are many areas where people are still discriminated against, not just because of their gender, but also because of where they are from or how they speak.\n\nFor example, people from rural areas may be looked down upon if they have poor grammar, even if they are very intelligent. This is another form of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a big problem in the US. We need to work slowly and carefully to fix it. We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "Marijuana was once against the law. But it's not anymore in some places. It's now like a traffic ticket. You get a fine instead of going to jail. \n\nThis change can be good or bad. Some people think it's good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people and put them in jail. It also costs money for the court and lawyers. \n\nDenver is a place where people are more open-minded. They think it's fine to have marijuana. They use the money to help the community. They spend it on schools, programs for older people, and food for those who are poor.\n\nBut some people don't think it's a good idea. They think it will make problems. There will be people smoking and driving. It's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. It will be awkward for a lot of people if it's everywhere.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana are both bad for people. But in different ways. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can hurt your lifestyle. It can make you make bad choices.\n\nPeople react differently to substances. Some people can handle them easily. Others can't. It's hard to say how marijuana will affect someone.\n\nBut both marijuana and alcohol can hurt people. They both have bad effects. It's good to be careful with them.",
            "I agree. \nWhy \nUm \nMany things they do are very traditional. \nFor a long time, they have done things the same way. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be open to change. \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nAnd \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes \nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nAnd \nIt does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nAnd \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nUm \nFor example \nMy mom was Episcopalian. \nNo \nI am sorry. \nMy dad was Episcopalian. \nMy mom was Catholic. \nThey would not marry my parents in the Catholic Church. \nBecause of my dad’s religion. \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat is not really \nLike \nBeing kind to others. \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others. \nThat is a Catholic teaching. \nBut \nIt is hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. \nSo \nI feel the Catholic doctrine says to do things. \nBut the Catholic practice is different. \nBecause it is old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway. \n\nUm \nI do not think that would necessarily be a reason to change. \nI mean \nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. \nBut \nAs \nI do not think that would necessarily stop them from being unkind to children. \nSo \nBecause it is a different situation \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably do not think that would be a problem \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who hurt children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they have a \nSpouse or not. \nBecause children are different from spouses. \nSo if you are going to do something bad \nYou are probably going to do it anyway. \nLike \nI do not think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose bad things from happening \nI think that would probably happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made up my mind. I do not know if one side is right or the other. This is a difficult subject. It is about the relationship between church and state. It is also about how we define marriage. This is hard to do without hurting someone’s feelings.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people. It is not just a sacrament. People should not get special treatment from the government just because they were baptized. If people are married, the government should not look at it as a religious thing. They should look at it as a civil union.\n\nTwo people who love each other should be able to make a union. They should not be judged. The fact that some people are gay is not important. They can also make a union.\n\nIf the states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But making a change to the constitution is too big a deal. It should not be changed just to ban gay marriage. This is not a big enough issue to make a change to the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to make a change to the constitution. We should not change the constitution just to define marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This made me think about my views on homosexuality. I do not fully understand this issue. I have many gay friends, and I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Each state should make its own decision about this.\n\nI think if you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that state's decision. You chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be allowed in each state.\n\nI have already answered this question. I do not agree with President Bush's decision to ban gay marriage. He should not make decisions for all the states. I do not think he should decide how each state should be governed. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will leave office soon. If a new president is elected, he may change the law on gay marriage. I think each state should make its own decision about this issue. They will have to live with the decision.\n\nNo, I am not a supporter of President Bush on this issue.",
            "I do not agree that the school officials overstepped their bounds. Myspace is a public place. If you put something on the internet, you should be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. They have the right to check Myspace to make sure students are safe. They can do this from their homes.\n\nThe school officials went on Myspace to prevent school shootings. Saving students' lives is a big responsibility of the school system. I think it is okay to check Myspace if it helps keep students safe.\n\nSome people might think it is an invasion of privacy to check Myspace. But if it makes the school a better and safer place, I do not think it is an invasion. \n\nWhen you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to be private. Many people post things they do not want others to see. But once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it off. \n\nThe school officials can find things you post on Myspace even if it is not under the school's name. They can use the internet to find out what students are doing.\n\nIf the school officials can use Myspace to make the school safer, I think it is okay. They should not just go on Myspace to catch students doing something wrong. \n\nOne teacher told me that schools must make sure students are safe. We have to do drills in case of emergencies. This is to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to make the school safer. They were checking Myspace to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to cause trouble for those who hurt us. However, I now think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term results of our actions. We went into the war without a clear plan.\n\nThings did not go well. We did not prepare well for the challenges we faced. War is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a savage way. They are not trying to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war to get revenge. The president decided to go to war because many people wanted to. We couldn't just ignore what happened and leave it alone. However, we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and didn't know what we were doing. We created more problems than we solved. I don't think we are the ones to change them. They will always be the same.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough to stay. It will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should not stay there forever."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to change in a few ways. They are losing followers because they are not very accepting of many things. This includes same-sex marriage, abortion, and birth control. The Catholic Church has strong views on these issues, but they are a little old-fashioned. If they adapted to more modern thinking, they might not lose so many followers.\n\nSome people are turning against the Catholic Church because of its views on these issues. They see the Church as having the wrong view on many things. The Catholic Church is against abortion, so if you support abortion, you might not be comfortable in a Church that teaches it is wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it and want to practice it, you might not want to be in a Church that doesn't agree.\n\nI don't see why priests can't be married or why there can't be female priests. The Catholic Church says priests are married to God and devoted to their work, but everyone else has a job and a family life. I don't see why priests can't have both.\n\nIf priests were allowed to be married or if there were female priests, it might not have changed the situation. However, it's hard to know for sure. What I do know is that many people are unhappy with the Catholic Church's views on these issues.",
            "I think gay marriage is okay. I believe people are born gay. They don't choose to be gay. I think they should not be blamed for who they are.\n\nI don't think it's right to say same-sex couples can't get married. It's not their choice. They are who they are.\n\nIt's not a choice, like being straight or left-handed. People are born that way. They should not be punished for their sexual orientation.\n\nThe federal government should not be involved in this issue. It's a personal matter. It's not a matter of national security or morality. They should not judge people for who they are.\n\nGay people should be treated with respect and kindness. They should not be hurt or punished for something they cannot change.\n\nI think that's all I want to say.",
            "I think gay marriage should be legal. Here's why:\n\nThere is no good reason not to. Many people believe that gay couples are a threat to the straight family. But that's not true. Their relationships are different, and that's okay. It's like two sides of the same coin. Heads and tails are different, but they are still the same coin.\n\nGay couples have the same rights as straight couples. They should be able to own property and get medical care. If a gay partner is sick, the other partner should be able to visit them in the hospital. This is a basic right.\n\nScientific studies show that gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same things that make relationships successful. They love each other and work together.\n\nGay couples are not asking to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. This is a civil right, not a church matter.\n\nIt's like segregation - separate but not equal. If the government allows civil unions, why not marriage?\n\nPeople worry about adoption and community issues. But gay couples are just like straight couples. They have the same roles and responsibilities.\n\nSome people are concerned about children of gay couples. But this is a small issue. Children of gay couples are just like children of straight couples. They need love and support, not a label.\n\nThe government should be involved in this issue. They should make gay marriage legal in every state. The federal government should support this.\n\nPresident Bush has strong views about gay marriage. But his views are based on his religion. This is not fair. The government should not enforce one group's morality on everyone else.\n\nSome people are against gay marriage because they think gay people are damaged or have a personality defect. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so.\n\nWe should listen to experts, not just popular opinion. If we do, we might see things differently.",
            "First, I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. \n\nSome people think that just because a medicine is illegal, it is not helpful. I do not agree. \n\nI think it is not a good idea to make a medicine available to the public if it is illegal. No, I do not think it is a good idea. However, I do think it is okay to use a medicine for medical reasons, even if it is illegal. \n\nThere are medicines that are illegal but still helpful. For example, oxycodone, Vicodin, and Percocet are all controlled substances. We use them in the pharmacy because they are helpful. If we deny the benefits of marijuana just because it is illegal, that is not fair. \n\nMarijuana is not like alcohol. If you misuse marijuana, it can cause harm. But if you misuse alcohol, it can also cause harm. It is a difficult question. I think we should be able to use marijuana responsibly. We can do this by allowing it to become legal gradually, not all at once. \n\nIf we remove the bad image of marijuana, people might use it responsibly. They might use it for medical reasons, which is a good thing. \n\nPeople think marijuana is bad because it is an illegal drug. But it is not as bad as heroin or cocaine. If we change the way people think about marijuana, they might use it responsibly.",
            "I think the church has changed to fit the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was younger, I went to church every Sunday. I always wore a nice dress and matching shoes and purse. I attended a private school with my friends. We saw each other every weekend.\n\nNow, the church has made changes. They now have a \"teenager mass\" that is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually during the summer. They even wear beach clothes right after the beach. Families are often late for morning masses. People wear jeans and khakis instead of dressing up.\n\nThe biggest change I have noticed is this more casual atmosphere. That is the main thing about the church I know. I do not know about the church's politics.\n\nRegarding the accusations of priests abusing children, I do not think these problems could have been avoided by changing the church's rules, such as allowing married priests or priests to marry. Some people who are married still abuse children. Their behavior is not because of their marital status.\n\nIt is also a person's choice to become a priest. There are other religions that allow married people to be clergy. They can still practice their faith and be married. If they want to do both, they might choose a different faith.\n\nI think abuse is based on genetics. People are born with these feelings. Their upbringing may play a small part, but it is mostly their genetics. You cannot hide this through marriage. It would usually come out eventually. I do not think the church could have prevented this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the abuse and tried to cover it up, that is a serious issue. However, I do not think they knew in all cases. \n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. The United States went to war in Iraq after the September 11th attacks in 2001. The Bush administration said that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that he was connected to Osama Bin Laden. But this was not true.\n\nThe Bush administration told many lies to the American people. Colin Powell, who was a high official, later said that he was not sure about the evidence when he presented it to the United Nations. This is very bad behavior for a government official.\n\nThe Bush administration did not respect the US Constitution and tried to limit its power. They wanted to go to war, but the Constitution says that the government must have a good reason to go to war.\n\nSome people think that President Bush wanted to go to war because of his father's old problems with Saddam Hussein. Bush also wanted to get more oil from Iraq.\n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there might be more problems and more people might die. The US and other countries are trying to work together to help Iraq, but it is not working well. The government in Iraq is not strong and has many problems.\n\nI do not know what to say about this situation. I do not think that the US should have gone to war, but now we cannot just leave.",
            "I have some thoughts about the War in Iraq.\n\nFirst, I am not clear about the situation. I don't know the details. I think the war was not officially declared by the US government. It was a reaction to the attacks on the United States on September 11.\n\nI don't think it's a good idea to stay in Iraq. Many people are unhappy about the war. We are using a lot of resources, and it's making a difficult situation worse. \n\nI also think about the Vietnam War. It was an undeclared war, and it's now considered a meaningless war. I don't want the same thing to happen with the War in Iraq.\n\nBut, I also think about the people in Iraq who have families and lives. They are suffering because of the war. We should consider their feelings.\n\nIt's hard for me to say what I think. I think we should leave Iraq, but I also think about the families who have loved ones there. If we leave, they will be unhappy, but if we stay, we will be changing their culture and making their lives worse.\n\nI'm not sure what the best thing to do is. I think this situation will continue for a long time.",
            "I don't think it's right for a state to make a law against a church. The constitution says there should be a separation of church and state. This means the government should not control what churches do. It is a clear statement in the constitution.\n\nI think people who want to make a law against a church are choosing one church's ideas over another. Most Catholics and Christians don't want this law. But some people in Boston and other places support it.\n\nI don't think the government should decide what churches can and cannot do. The separation of church and state is a key part of the constitution. It allows for freedom of religion in the United States.\n\nEven if the government wanted to make an amendment to the constitution, I think it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written. And it would be one of the only amendments to take away people's rights rather than limit the government's power.\n\nI don't think the government should be involved in this issue. The president's decision to push for this amendment seems to be based on his own Catholic beliefs. He wants one religion to be treated better than others.\n\nIt is up to the churches to decide what they want to do, not the government. There is no good reason for the amendment, except that the president thinks it's a good idea. It won't help the economy, but it might make society better.\n\nI have said all I want to say on this issue.",
            "The war in Iraq happened in 2003. Many Americans did not agree with the reasons the government gave for the war. They thought the government was not honest about the reasons for going to war. The government tried to connect the war in Iraq to the 9/11 attacks. However, this connection was not clear.\n\nI am against war. I do not think the US government was ready for the consequences of war. Many American soldiers died in Iraq. This is very sad. The US removed the government of Iraq. But they did not plan well for the future.\n\nThe US government took out the Iraqi government. They wanted to put a new government in place. But they did not think about the problems that would come after. The US is still in Iraq now. Many Americans are still dying. The US is trying to help the Iraqi military and police learn to control their country.\n\nThe US government made it seem like the war in Iraq would be easy to win. But it is not easy to create a democracy. It took many years for the US to become a democratic country. The US government should have learned from their past mistakes.\n\nIn the 2004 presidential election, I thought about voting for President Bush. One reason was that I thought he should finish what he started. But now I am not sure. The US is still in Iraq after a long time. We took away their government and way of life. Should we leave now? That is a difficult question.\n\nThe US is risking many American lives in Iraq. Is it worth it? We went to war for a free democratic Iraq. But why not for other countries? I think it is really about oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq.\n\nThe government said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. But they were not found. Other countries with weapons of mass destruction, like North Korea, are not being attacked. The US government is not being honest about their decisions.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq ends soon and there is peace. But I am not sure that will happen.",
            "I think gay marriage is right. I have always thought so. This is a personal matter. Many experts now say that a person's sexual preference is not their choice. It is in their body. They cannot change it.\n\nThe government should not control this. It is not a state issue. It is a personal and family matter. In my neighborhood, there are gay couples who are not married. But they behave like other families. They take care of their dogs and go for walks.\n\nThe President of the United States is trying to decide what marriage is. This is not his job. It is not right for him to decide.\n\nExperts say that some people are born gay. It may be because of a chemical in their brain. It is not because of how they are raised. For example, if a boy has many sisters and no father, it does not make him gay.\n\nMarriage is a private matter. If a man and a woman want to marry, they can do it in secret. But if two gay people want to marry, it is a public issue.\n\nThis should be a private matter, not a matter for the government or the country.",
            "When you put something on the internet, it is public. Anyone can see it. This is very important to remember. As a resident advisor, I have seen this happen before. \n\nWhen you post something online, it can affect people's opinions about you. If you talk about something bad, like violence, someone will share it. The internet is open to everyone. If you are friends with someone on Myspace, you may see what they post.\n\nThis can be a problem. Schools may find out about something you posted. They cannot ignore it because they have to keep everyone safe. If something bad happens, they could have stopped it.\n\nBut it is also hard to know what to believe. Some people just make jokes online. For example, maybe someone in a class did an experiment that went wrong on purpose. Or it could be a real problem.\n\nRecently, something happened at our school. Someone overheard someone talking about something, and they reported it. We found out who the person was, and we looked at their Facebook page. There were things on there that they meant as jokes, but they were taken seriously. \n\nWhen you post things online, it is like sharing them with everyone. You cannot control who sees them. If you don't want someone to know something, don't share it online. You cannot stop people from thinking what they want to think.\n\nSchool officials should not friend their students on social media. They should not read their private messages either. But if someone brings something to their attention, they have to take it seriously.\n\nAs a resident advisor, I think it's best not to connect with my residents online.

            "I have a problem with the way the war has been going on for such a long time. I think the original goal was good - to help another country have a fair government. But now, I'm not sure the reason for the war is clear. We may be fighting just to show our power.\n\nI think the war started for a good reason. We wanted to help a country with an unfair government. However, I'm not sure this is still the main reason we're fighting. Maybe we started for personal reasons, like to prove something. \n\nI think we already made our point in the beginning. We started the war to give democracy to a country that did not have a fair system. But now, the war has gone on for many years. This is a long time.\n\nIf our goal was to help a country ruled by a bad leader, that's a good reason for war. But I'm not sure that's still our goal. It seems we're just fighting because we want to fight.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we're helping will have to take care of itself soon. We should stop spending a lot of money on this war. We have problems in our own country that we should be solving, like poverty and poor schools.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war. This money could be used to fix problems in our own country. We need to spend our money on things that help our own citizens, like health care and roads.\n\nI think we should stop the war because it's costly and not solving the problem we started with. We should focus on helping our own country instead.",
            "You have a question. You think it's good that someone stopped something bad from happening because they looked at someone's information on the internet.

You can control who sees your information by accepting them as friends, but this means you are giving them permission to see it.\n\nIt's hard to control who sees information on the internet. One person can't look at everyone's profiles all the time. But if someone is looking at many profiles to prevent bad things from happening, it might be unfair. They might think only certain people are bad.\n\nYou have a Facebook account and it bothers you that strangers can see things about you. You saw a TV show about a man who easily got information about someone online. He got their screen name and talked to them on instant messenger in just a minute. This is why you limit what you put on Facebook, but you also want to stay in touch with friends.\n\nMany people worry about this issue. Your roommate's high school banned students from having Myspace. But you're not sure if this is right. Can schools tell students what they can and can't do on the internet?",
            "I am not sure about the Iraq War. It was a difficult decision. I do not like talking about it. Many people think it was a bad idea. Most people around the world do not agree with the decision to go to war. About 75 to 80 percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and other countries think the war was a bad idea.\n\nMost U.S. soldiers in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea. They want to leave Iraq within a year. The country was already in trouble when the U.S. went in. Now it is hard to leave. There is a big difference between American culture and the culture in the Middle East. It is hard to bring democracy to countries where people want to make their own choices.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad ruler, but the U.S. should have thought about the consequences before going to war. The situation in Iraq is like quicksand. It is hard to get out. I do not see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The U.S. government may have some ideas for staying, but I do not agree with them.\n\nIf the U.S. leaves Iraq slowly over time, I would not have a problem with that. But I do not see a reason to stay any longer than we should. Many Iraqis want the U.S. to leave within a year. Some want the U.S. to leave now. These are the people we are trying to help.\n\nI think it is better to do what Iraqis want. If they tell us to leave, then it is not our responsibility if things go badly. If we decide to help them after they ask us to leave, we can be seen as trying to help. It is not easy to be seen as the good guy in the Middle East. But it is better than where we are now.",
            "There is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This problem is called gender discrimination.\n\nIn the US, women have an especially hard time. They often face a \"glass ceiling\" that prevents them from getting to the top of their jobs. Even when they have all the qualifications for a job, they may not get promoted because society has not seen many women in leadership positions in the past.\n\nThe same thing can happen to men in certain jobs, like in the fashion industry. People may not take them seriously if they are not like other men in the fashion industry. This can be because men in the fashion industry have different styles of life.\n\nIn many areas, men are expected to be the main earners of a family. If a man stays home to take care of the children, people may think it's strange. This can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, people may not take men seriously if they are straight. They may think men who like fashion are not like other men.\n\nTo change this, we need to work slowly and carefully. We have made a lot of progress since the 1800s, but change is slow. As women get more jobs and become CEOs, people are starting to accept them more. The same is happening with men who stay home to take care of their children.\n\nThe key is to show people the good qualities of people who are often stereotyped. We should not push people to accept things too quickly. If we do, they will resist. Instead, we should show them the good qualities of these people, and they will start to accept them more.\n\nWe are at a good point right now, where people are starting to accept things more. However, we still have a long way to go. There are many areas where people are still discriminated against, not just because of their gender, but also because of where they are from or how they speak.\n\nFor example, people from rural areas may be looked down upon if they have poor grammar, even if they are very intelligent. This is another form of discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, gender discrimination is a big problem in the US. We need to work slowly and carefully to fix it. We have made progress, but we still have a long way to go.",
            "Marijuana was once against the law. But it's not anymore in some places. It's now like a traffic ticket. You get a fine instead of going to jail. \n\nThis change can be good or bad. Some people think it's good because it saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people and put them in jail. It also costs money for the court and lawyers. \n\nDenver is a place where people are more open-minded. They think it's fine to have marijuana. They use the money to help the community. They spend it on schools, programs for older people, and food for those who are poor.\n\nBut some people don't think it's a good idea. They think it will make problems. There will be people smoking and driving. It's still not okay in many places to smoke marijuana. It will be awkward for a lot of people if it's everywhere.\n\nAlcohol and marijuana are both bad for people. But in different ways. Alcohol can hurt your ability to drive. Marijuana can hurt your lifestyle. It can make you make bad choices.\n\nPeople react differently to substances. Some people can handle them easily. Others can't. It's hard to say how marijuana will affect someone.\n\nBut both marijuana and alcohol can hurt people. They both have bad effects. It's good to be careful with them.",
            "I agree. \nWhy \nUm \nMany things they do are very traditional. \nFor a long time, they have done things the same way. \nIt is good to be connected to tradition. \nBut it is also important to be open to change. \nUm \nI think \nMany Catholics believe they must go to church every week. \nAnd \nThey are very strict about how things are done. \nSometimes \nI feel the Catholic Church looks down on people who do not follow the rules exactly. \nAnd \nIt does not accept people who are not perfect Catholics. \nAnd \nIt also does not accept people of other religions. \nUm \nFor example \nMy mom was Episcopalian. \nNo \nI am sorry. \nMy dad was Episcopalian. \nMy mom was Catholic. \nThey would not marry my parents in the Catholic Church. \nBecause of my dad’s religion. \n\nAnd \nUm \nThat is not really \nLike \nBeing kind to others. \nUm \nWe always learned to \nYou know \nLove others. \nThat is a Catholic teaching. \nBut \nIt is hypocritical to say to love others and not accept them. \nSo \nI feel the Catholic doctrine says to do things. \nBut the Catholic practice is different. \nBecause it is old-fashioned. \nBut they continue to do it anyway. \n\nUm \nI do not think that would necessarily be a reason to change. \nI mean \nI personally think it would be a good idea to allow priests to marry. \nBut \nAs \nI do not think that would necessarily stop them from being unkind to children. \nSo \nBecause it is a different situation \nUm \nIt might \nBut I probably do not think that would be a problem \n\nUm \nWell \nI guess \nLike \nPeople who hurt children \nProbably would do that regardless of whether they have a \nSpouse or not. \nBecause children are different from spouses. \nSo if you are going to do something bad \nYou are probably going to do it anyway. \nLike \nI do not think \nAllowing priests to be married would prevent \nUm \nThose bad things from happening \nI think that would probably happen anyway.",
            "I am not sure about this issue. I have not made up my mind. I do not know if one side is right or the other. This is a difficult subject. It is about the relationship between church and state. It is also about how we define marriage. This is hard to do without hurting someone’s feelings.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people. It is not just a sacrament. People should not get special treatment from the government just because they were baptized. If people are married, the government should not look at it as a religious thing. They should look at it as a civil union.\n\nTwo people who love each other should be able to make a union. They should not be judged. The fact that some people are gay is not important. They can also make a union.\n\nIf the states can agree on this, they should make it a federal law. But making a change to the constitution is too big a deal. It should not be changed just to ban gay marriage. This is not a big enough issue to make a change to the constitution.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to make a change to the constitution. We should not change the constitution just to define marriage.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This made me think about my views on homosexuality. I do not fully understand this issue. I have many gay friends, and I do not agree with their lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a national issue. Each state should make its own decision about this.\n\nI think if you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect that state's decision. You chose to live there. I believe that homosexuals should have the same rights as heterosexuals. Therefore, I think gay marriage should be allowed in each state.\n\nI have already answered this question. I do not agree with President Bush's decision to ban gay marriage. He should not make decisions for all the states. I do not think he should decide how each state should be governed. \n\nI think some things should be decided by each state. President Bush will leave office soon. If a new president is elected, he may change the law on gay marriage. I think each state should make its own decision about this issue. They will have to live with the decision.\n\nNo, I am not a supporter of President Bush on this issue.",
            "I do not agree that the school officials overstepped their bounds. Myspace is a public place. If you put something on the internet, you should be prepared for others to see it. This includes school officials. They have the right to check Myspace to make sure students are safe. They can do this from their homes.\n\nThe school officials went on Myspace to prevent school shootings. Saving students' lives is a big responsibility of the school system. I think it is okay to check Myspace if it helps keep students safe.\n\nSome people might think it is an invasion of privacy to check Myspace. But if it makes the school a better and safer place, I do not think it is an invasion. \n\nWhen you post something on Myspace, you should not expect to be private. Many people post things they do not want others to see. But once it is on the internet, it is hard to get it off. \n\nThe school officials can find things you post on Myspace even if it is not under the school's name. They can use the internet to find out what students are doing.\n\nIf the school officials can use Myspace to make the school safer, I think it is okay. They should not just go on Myspace to catch students doing something wrong. \n\nOne teacher told me that schools must make sure students are safe. We have to do drills in case of emergencies. This is to make the school a safer place.\n\nThe school officials were just trying to make the school safer. They were checking Myspace to prevent bad things from happening, like a school shooting.",
            "I have mixed feelings about a war. At first, I supported it because I was affected by 9/11. I wanted to cause trouble for those who hurt us. However, I now think we made a mistake. We didn't think about the long-term results of our actions. We went into the war without a clear plan.\n\nThings did not go well. We did not prepare well for the challenges we faced. War is different in their country than in ours. They fight in a savage way. They are not trying to make their country better; they just want us to leave.\n\nI think we went to war to get revenge. The president decided to go to war because many people wanted to. We couldn't just ignore what happened and leave it alone. However, we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe didn't have unity and didn't know what we were doing. We created more problems than we solved. I don't think we are the ones to change them. They will always be the same.\n\nWe have made some progress, but not enough to stay. It will collapse when we leave. We are hurting ourselves by staying. We should not stay there forever."

that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strict views on certain things. For example, they do not allow gay marriage. They also do not allow abortion and do not support birth control. Many people think these views are old-fashioned.\n\nSome people are leaving the Catholic Church because they disagree with these views. They believe the Church's views are not modern. The Church's views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control make some people uncomfortable. They do not want to be part of a group that teaches these things are wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or married. Many people do not understand why this is. They think it is unfair. But the Church says its priests are married to God. They must devote their lives to God. However, most people have jobs and families. They can balance work and family life. So, it is hard to see why priests cannot have both a job and a family.\n\nIf the Church were more open-minded, it might not lose followers. The Church could learn from other people's ideas and be more accepting. This might help it keep its members.\n\nIn the past, some bad things happened in the Catholic Church. People were hurt. It is hard to say if allowing priests to be married or having women priests would have prevented these bad things. But it is an idea to consider.\n\nOverall, I think the Catholic Church needs to be more open and accepting. This might help it keep its members and be more relevant in the world today.",
            "I do not have a problem with gay marriage. I think people are born a certain way. They did not choose to be gay. I do not think it is right to blame someone for their sexual orientation. I think it is not fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot.\n\nPeople are not born with a choice about how they feel. I was born straight. Another person might be born gay. We do not choose how we feel. I do not think the government should get involved. This is not a matter of law or morals. I do not think the government should tell people how to live their lives.\n\nThe government should not interfere with people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are. They were born that way. They should not be punished for it.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in gay marriage. It is not a matter of national security or morals. The government should stay out of people's private lives.\n\nI believe people should be free to live their lives as they want. We are all different. We should respect each other's differences.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. \n\nThere are no good reasons not to. \n\nMany people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But, this is not true. \n\nGay couples are not the same as traditional couples. It is like comparing two different things. They are like two different sides of the same coin. \n\nBut, they have the same rights. For example, property taxes and healthcare. If you are in a gay couple, your partner cannot visit you in the hospital if they are not considered family. \n\nThis is not fair. If you are going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as others. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are the same as traditional couples in terms of success and happiness. They have the same factors that make relationships work. \n\nThe thing that often gets people upset is that gay couples do not want to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nThey are the same as traditional couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities. \n\nPeople also worry about children of gay couples and how they will be treated by society. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nIn some cities, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. But, this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in traditional couples. It is about personal choice. \n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage based on his religion. But, morality is different for everyone. The government should not make laws based on one group's morality. \n\nIt is hypocritical for the government to enforce laws that are based on one group's religion, but not others. \n\nSome people think that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma. But, this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to research and not just popular opinion.",

I do not agree with this idea.\n\nI think medicines that are against the law should not be available to the public. However, I believe they can be very helpful for medical reasons. A medicine does not have to be against the law to be helpful.\n\nSome medicines that are against the law are used in pharmacies. We use these medicines because they are helpful. They are called controlled substances. People do not understand that some medicines against the law can be good for you.\n\nIf a medicine is against the law, it is not good just because it is against the law. Marijuana is against the law, but some medicines we use in pharmacies are also against the law. If people understand that some medicines against the law can be helpful, they might use marijuana responsibly.\n\nUsing marijuana can be bad if you use too much of it. However, using too much of any drug can be bad. It is not the same as drinking too much alcohol.\n\nI think it would be better to let people use marijuana responsibly, not all at once. We need to change the way people think about marijuana. Many people think marijuana is bad, but it is not as bad as some other medicines against the law, like heroin or cocaine.\n\nIf people understand that marijuana is not as bad as they think, they might use it for medical reasons. We should change the idea that marijuana is a bad medicine.",
            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it used to be. I know this because I have grown up and attended church every Sunday as a child. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was my usual Sunday routine. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together. Now, the church has made some changes. They have created a special service for teenagers that is only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families come late, and people wear jeans and khakis to the morning masses.\n\nI think the church has become more casual. This is the biggest change I have noticed. I do not understand the church's politics, but this is my view. I think the church is changing to make people feel more comfortable.\n\nSome people have accused Catholic priests of doing bad things with children. This is a serious problem. I do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these problems. Some men who are married still do bad things. Their choice to become a priest is what matters. Other religions have priests who can get married. For example, some preachers in the TV show \"7th Heaven\" are married. They have a choice to be married and practice their faith at the same time. If someone wants to get married and be a priest, they should choose a different faith.\n\nI think people are born with a certain way of being. I think it is true that some people have a problem with children because of their genetics. They cannot hide this by getting married. It will usually come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening if the person does not want to change. If the church knew and tried to hide it, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I have some thoughts on the Iraq war. When the United States went into Iraq after the 9/11 attacks, it seemed like something was not right. Many people thought the war was connected to the 9/11 attacks, but it was later found that this was not true. \n\nThe US government said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was also found to be false. This made me very unhappy. The government seemed to be lying to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is serious. I think it is wrong for the government to lie to the people.\n\nThe US government seems to have little respect for the Constitution. They have been trying to limit its power since 9/11. When President Bush took office, he wanted to go to war. A high government official said that the president's son George W. Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome people think the war was started for a reason other than to keep the US safe. They think it was also about oil. This is a problem in itself. \n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there is a chance that the country will fall into civil war. Many more people might die. To avoid this, the US and the UN are planning to bring in other countries to help restore order. However, this might cause more problems in the long run. \n\nThe new government in Iraq is not working well. The people in charge do not have control. A group that was fighting against the US a year ago now has many seats in the government. This is causing problems and making it hard to make decisions.\n\nI do not have a clear solution to this problem.",

I know that the US is trying to build a democracy in Iraq, so it can be like the US. The US also wants oil from Iraq. \n\nHowever, I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. It is causing problems for the people there. If the US stays, it will take a long time to build a democracy. But if the US leaves, the Iraqis will be upset with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI do not know what to say about the war. I think it is complicated. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end so they can come home safely. However, I also think that if we stay in Iraq, we will be trying to change their culture to be like ours. This could make things worse for them.\n\nI think the group Al-Kaida will become even stronger if we stay in Iraq. They will be angry with the US because we are trying to change their way of life.

The Constitution also says there should be no interference between the government and church.

The Constitution is like a set of rules for the government. It is written and should be followed. I do not think it is right for the government to decide which church is right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. Even though some people want to add a new rule to the Constitution, I do not think it is right. It would be against what the Constitution already says.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what is right or wrong for churches. That is up to the churches themselves. I do not see why the president is pushing for this rule. It seems to be because he does not like something that many churches do.\n\nThe president's rule is not fair. It favors one church over others. I do not think that is right. The government should not interfere with what the churches do. I do not see how this rule will help the country. If anything, it might help our society. \n\nI have said what I think. That is my opinion.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult decision for the US government. They did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war. The government said the invasion of Iraq was connected to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, this was not true. The American people were angry after the attacks, and the government used this anger to make the invasion seem necessary.\n\nI do not like war. I do not think the US government was prepared for the war in Iraq. The government did not think about the problems that would happen after they took down the Iraqi government. Many American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to create a new one. They wanted to bring democracy to Iraq. But this is very hard to do. It took many years for democracy to develop in the US. There were many struggles and a civil war.\n\nThe US government made the war in Iraq seem easy. But it is not easy to create a new government. The government should have thought about the problems that would happen after the war. They should have been honest with the American people about the war.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether the US should stay in Iraq or leave. The US took away the Iraqi government and now they are responsible for the country. Many American soldiers have died in the war. The US should think about how many more soldiers will die if they stay in Iraq.\n\nI was unsure about the war in Iraq when I voted in the presidential election. I thought about voting for George Bush because he started the war. It is hard to stop a war once it has started. But the US should think about the cost of the war. Many American soldiers have died, and it is hard to know when the war will end.\n\nThe main reason the US went to war in Iraq was for oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. This is not the only reason for war, but it is a big one. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. This was not the truth. The US government should be honest when making decisions about war.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon. I hope there will be peace in Iraq. But this may not happen.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always thought so. I believe it is a personal preference. Many people now think it has a biological reason, not a reason caused by how we are raised.\n\nIt is not fair to give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control. I think it is cruel. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think government and politics should be involved in this. This is a personal issue, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is silly for the government to try to decide what marriage is. Some people think that being gay is a chemical thing in the brain. It is not a choice. It is not caused by how someone is raised.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they can do it without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it is on the front page of the newspaper. I think it should be a personal matter, not a public issue.\n\nIs that all?",

But if someone found information that really helped, it's hard to say if they were looking randomly or if they were looking for something specific.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and I know that bad people can see things about me. I saw a TV show about a man who was able to find information about someone easily. He got her screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in a short time. It's hard to know who can see our information online.\n\nI try to limit what I post on Facebook, but it's hard to know who might be looking. I only accept people I know as friends, but I still don't know who might be looking at my information. I heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right or not.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It's a difficult topic, and I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up. But I'll try to be honest.\n\nAt first, I was against the war. Many people were against it. But it's not as important now. The main idea of the war was not a good one. Most people, including the United States government, now agree with this.\n\nIf we look at polls, we see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis want the United States to leave. Most American soldiers serving in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we entered. Now, it's a disaster. It's hard to fix the problem. There's a big difference in culture between the United States and the Middle East. This makes it difficult for the United States to understand what Iraqis want.\n\nSome people thought that democracy would work in Iraq. But Iraqis might have chosen a different way of living. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we have to think about the pros and cons before making big decisions.\n\nThe war has caused many problems. It's like quicksand - the more we stay, the deeper we get. I don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The US government might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I don't agree with them.\n\nIf we leave slowly over time, I wouldn't object to that. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. Many Iraqis think we should leave now. They are the people we're trying to help. If we ask them what they want, it's better to listen.\n\nIf we leave and things go wrong, we can say we tried to leave, but Iraqis asked us to stay. This way, we'll be the good guys. At least, we'll be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This is true in many workplaces. Women often face more challenges when looking for a job or trying to move up in their careers. \n\nOne big reason is that women are not seen as leaders in many industries. Even when women have all the qualifications for a job, they may not be chosen for it. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nMen can also face problems in certain jobs. For example, men who stay at home to take care of their children are often looked down upon. This is because society expects men to be the main breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think they are not experts on fashion because they are men.\n\nIt is difficult to change these attitudes. It takes time and effort. But things are getting better. More women are becoming leaders and being accepted in business. Men who stay at home to take care of their children are becoming more accepted too.\n\nWe can promote equality by showing the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. If we force people to accept change, they may resist. We need to be patient and let change happen naturally.\n\nPeople from different places and backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone who grew up on a farm and didn't have a good education may be looked down upon if they try to get a job in a big city. They may be judged on how they speak, not on their intelligence or skills.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a serious crime to have it. In some places, it was a big deal to have marijuana, but now it's not as bad. People who have marijuana can get a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and not get arrested. This is good because it saves money for the police and the court system. When someone gets a ticket for marijuana, it doesn't always hurt their future very much. But some people worry that even if it's decriminalized, it will still affect their life.\n\nSome people think it's better to not spend money on arresting people for marijuana. It costs a lot to arrest, book, and house people, and then to take them to court. It also costs money to pay a lawyer and the judge. If a community is in financial trouble, they might not want to change the laws about marijuana. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded and think it's okay.\n\nDecriminalizing marijuana can also help cities have more money for important things like education and helping people who are homeless. People should think about the money and the rules about marijuana.\n\nSome people worry that if marijuana is completely legal, it will be everywhere and people will smoke it all the time. This could be a problem because it's still not okay to smoke and drive. Also, many people still think smoking marijuana is not good. They might be uncomfortable if it's out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. They can affect how people think and how they act. But people are different and react to substances in different ways. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. It's hard to say how bad marijuana or alcohol is because people are different.",
            "I agree with this idea \nBecause \nMany people in this group do the same things for a long time \nThey have a strong past \nIt's good to remember the past, but we also need to change \nSome people must go to church every week \nThey have rules for doing things \nBut sometimes, they look down on people who don't follow the rules \nThey don't accept people who do not think the same way \nFor example \nMy mother is Episcopalian, my father is Episcopalian, but my mother is Catholic \nThey could not get married in a Catholic church because of my father's religion \n\nI think this is not very fair \nWe should love others, but we should also accept them \nThis is a teaching of the Catholic Church \nBut sometimes, they don't practice what they preach \n\nI don't think this would make a difference \nI think priests should be allowed to marry, but it might not stop some priests from doing bad things \nThey might still hurt children \n\nMost people who hurt children will do it no matter what \nIt's not the same as hurting a partner \nSo, we should not think that allowing priests to marry will stop it \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I have some thoughts on this issue, but I am not sure what to think. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a difficult problem because it involves two important things: the separation of church and state, and the definition of marriage.\n\nDefining marriage is hard because it involves many people's feelings and ideas. Some people think marriage should be looked at as a religious matter, while others think it should be a matter for the government. If marriage is a sacrament, then people might get special treatment from the government. For example, they might get tax breaks or other benefits.\n\nIf marriage is just a civil union, then people should not be judged by what kind of marriage they have. They should just be seen as two people who are together. This is what marriage is - two people who are united.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. It is simply a matter of two people who love each other and want to be together. They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, they should work to make it a federal law. But making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big enough issue to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not right to change the constitution just to ban something. We should not make big changes to the constitution without a good reason.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is just a matter of defining what marriage is and who should be able to get married.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes my feelings about homosexuality a little complicated.\n\nI have many gay friends, and I have thought about this issue a lot. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a major national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there, after all.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. This is why I believe it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush does not live in every state, so he should not tell each state how to make its own decisions. Some things are best left to individual states.\n\nThe president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will switch back and forth. It is better for each state to decide for itself.\n\nNo.",
            "I don't agree with this idea. Schools have the right to see what students post on the internet. Even if students are not posting under the school's name, officials can still see it if they try. They can check it at home or find it another way.\n\nThe main reason schools do this is to keep students safe. If they see something that could lead to trouble, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. I think it's okay for schools to do this.\n\nSome people might think it's wrong for schools to check the internet for students. But if it helps keep the school safe, I don't see a problem. Schools can check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking. They do this to catch students who are breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, if they are just checking the internet to get students in trouble, that is different. That's not okay. \n\nSchools have to make sure students are safe. They do this by practicing things like lockdowns and drills in case of emergencies like a terrorist attack. This is like what happened at Columbine. So, schools are just trying to make sure they can keep students safe.\n\nI think it's better for schools to check the internet to keep students safe. If they can prevent something bad from happening, that's a good thing.",
            "I have mixed feelings about going to war in a country. At first, I thought I wanted to go because my country was attacked on 9/11. However, I was young and emotional at the time. I wanted to fight back and cause problems in the country where the attack happened.\n\nBut, I think we made a mistake. We did not think carefully about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to the country without a clear plan and without being prepared for what we might face. This led to problems and made things worse.\n\nI now think that we should not have gotten involved. The people in the country were already fighting among themselves. We going in was not going to solve their problems. In fact, it made things more complicated.\n\nI think the people in the country are different from us. They think about war in a different way. They do not want to change their country to be more like ours. They are not looking to make their country better; they are looking for a way to get rid of us.\n\nI think we should have left them alone. We were not thinking clearly when we went to war. We were too emotional and angry. We were looking for revenge, not a way to solve problems.\n\nI believe that President Bush made a big mistake. He declared war without thinking carefully about what we were doing. He was under pressure from the people, but he should have been more careful.\n\nI don't think we could have avoided going to war, but we could have been more careful and planned better. We needed to have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve and how we were going to do it.\n\nBut, we did not have a good plan. We did not work together as a team. We did not think about the consequences of our actions. We just went in without thinking.\n\nIn the end, I think we are not the right people to change the country. They are too different from us. We are just making things worse by staying there. We need to leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strict views on certain things. For example, they do not allow gay marriage. They also do not allow abortion and do not support birth control. Many people think these views are old-fashioned.\n\nSome people are leaving the Catholic Church because they disagree with these views. They believe the Church's views are not modern. The Church's views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control make some people uncomfortable. They do not want to be part of a group that teaches these things are wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or married. Many people do not understand why this is. They think it is unfair. But the Church says its priests are married to God. They must devote their lives to God. However, most people have jobs and families. They can balance work and family life. So, it is hard to see why priests cannot have both a job and a family.\n\nIf the Church were more open-minded, it might not lose followers. The Church could learn from other people's ideas and be more accepting. This might help it keep its members.\n\nIn the past, some bad things happened in the Catholic Church. People were hurt. It is hard to say if allowing priests to be married or having women priests would have prevented these bad things. But it is an idea to consider.\n\nOverall, I think the Catholic Church needs to be more open and accepting. This might help it keep its members and be more relevant in the world today.",
            "I do not have a problem with gay marriage. I think people are born a certain way. They did not choose to be gay. I do not think it is right to blame someone for their sexual orientation. I think it is not fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot.\n\nPeople are not born with a choice about how they feel. I was born straight. Another person might be born gay. We do not choose how we feel. I do not think the government should get involved. This is not a matter of law or morals. I do not think the government should tell people how to live their lives.\n\nThe government should not interfere with people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are. They were born that way. They should not be punished for it.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in gay marriage. It is not a matter of national security or morals. The government should stay out of people's private lives.\n\nI believe people should be free to live their lives as they want. We are all different. We should respect each other's differences.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. \n\nThere are no good reasons not to. \n\nMany people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But, this is not true. \n\nGay couples are not the same as traditional couples. It is like comparing two different things. They are like two different sides of the same coin. \n\nBut, they have the same rights. For example, property taxes and healthcare. If you are in a gay couple, your partner cannot visit you in the hospital if they are not considered family. \n\nThis is not fair. If you are going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as others. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are the same as traditional couples in terms of success and happiness. They have the same factors that make relationships work. \n\nThe thing that often gets people upset is that gay couples do not want to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nThey are the same as traditional couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities. \n\nPeople also worry about children of gay couples and how they will be treated by society. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nIn some cities, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. But, this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in traditional couples. It is about personal choice. \n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage based on his religion. But, morality is different for everyone. The government should not make laws based on one group's morality. \n\nIt is hypocritical for the government to enforce laws that are based on one group's religion, but not others. \n\nSome people think that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma. But, this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to research and not just popular opinion.",

I do not agree with this idea.\n\nI think medicines that are against the law should not be available to the public. However, I believe they can be very helpful for medical reasons. A medicine does not have to be against the law to be helpful.\n\nSome medicines that are against the law are used in pharmacies. We use these medicines because they are helpful. They are called controlled substances. People do not understand that some medicines against the law can be good for you.\n\nIf a medicine is against the law, it is not good just because it is against the law. Marijuana is against the law, but some medicines we use in pharmacies are also against the law. If people understand that some medicines against the law can be helpful, they might use marijuana responsibly.\n\nUsing marijuana can be bad if you use too much of it. However, using too much of any drug can be bad. It is not the same as drinking too much alcohol.\n\nI think it would be better to let people use marijuana responsibly, not all at once. We need to change the way people think about marijuana. Many people think marijuana is bad, but it is not as bad as some other medicines against the law, like heroin or cocaine.\n\nIf people understand that marijuana is not as bad as they think, they might use it for medical reasons. We should change the idea that marijuana is a bad medicine.",
            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it used to be. I know this because I have grown up and attended church every Sunday as a child. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was my usual Sunday routine. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together. Now, the church has made some changes. They have created a special service for teenagers that is only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families come late, and people wear jeans and khakis to the morning masses.\n\nI think the church has become more casual. This is the biggest change I have noticed. I do not understand the church's politics, but this is my view. I think the church is changing to make people feel more comfortable.\n\nSome people have accused Catholic priests of doing bad things with children. This is a serious problem. I do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these problems. Some men who are married still do bad things. Their choice to become a priest is what matters. Other religions have priests who can get married. For example, some preachers in the TV show \"7th Heaven\" are married. They have a choice to be married and practice their faith at the same time. If someone wants to get married and be a priest, they should choose a different faith.\n\nI think people are born with a certain way of being. I think it is true that some people have a problem with children because of their genetics. They cannot hide this by getting married. It will usually come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening if the person does not want to change. If the church knew and tried to hide it, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I have some thoughts on the Iraq war. When the United States went into Iraq after the 9/11 attacks, it seemed like something was not right. Many people thought the war was connected to the 9/11 attacks, but it was later found that this was not true. \n\nThe US government said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was also found to be false. This made me very unhappy. The government seemed to be lying to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is serious. I think it is wrong for the government to lie to the people.\n\nThe US government seems to have little respect for the Constitution. They have been trying to limit its power since 9/11. When President Bush took office, he wanted to go to war. A high government official said that the president's son George W. Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome people think the war was started for a reason other than to keep the US safe. They think it was also about oil. This is a problem in itself. \n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there is a chance that the country will fall into civil war. Many more people might die. To avoid this, the US and the UN are planning to bring in other countries to help restore order. However, this might cause more problems in the long run. \n\nThe new government in Iraq is not working well. The people in charge do not have control. A group that was fighting against the US a year ago now has many seats in the government. This is causing problems and making it hard to make decisions.\n\nI do not have a clear solution to this problem.",

I know that the US is trying to build a democracy in Iraq, so it can be like the US. The US also wants oil from Iraq. \n\nHowever, I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. It is causing problems for the people there. If the US stays, it will take a long time to build a democracy. But if the US leaves, the Iraqis will be upset with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI do not know what to say about the war. I think it is complicated. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end so they can come home safely. However, I also think that if we stay in Iraq, we will be trying to change their culture to be like ours. This could make things worse for them.\n\nI think the group Al-Kaida will become even stronger if we stay in Iraq. They will be angry with the US because we are trying to change their way of life.

The Constitution also says there should be no interference between the government and church.

The Constitution is like a set of rules for the government. It is written and should be followed. I do not think it is right for the government to decide which church is right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. Even though some people want to add a new rule to the Constitution, I do not think it is right. It would be against what the Constitution already says.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what is right or wrong for churches. That is up to the churches themselves. I do not see why the president is pushing for this rule. It seems to be because he does not like something that many churches do.\n\nThe president's rule is not fair. It favors one church over others. I do not think that is right. The government should not interfere with what the churches do. I do not see how this rule will help the country. If anything, it might help our society. \n\nI have said what I think. That is my opinion.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult decision for the US government. They did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war. The government said the invasion of Iraq was connected to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, this was not true. The American people were angry after the attacks, and the government used this anger to make the invasion seem necessary.\n\nI do not like war. I do not think the US government was prepared for the war in Iraq. The government did not think about the problems that would happen after they took down the Iraqi government. Many American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to create a new one. They wanted to bring democracy to Iraq. But this is very hard to do. It took many years for democracy to develop in the US. There were many struggles and a civil war.\n\nThe US government made the war in Iraq seem easy. But it is not easy to create a new government. The government should have thought about the problems that would happen after the war. They should have been honest with the American people about the war.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether the US should stay in Iraq or leave. The US took away the Iraqi government and now they are responsible for the country. Many American soldiers have died in the war. The US should think about how many more soldiers will die if they stay in Iraq.\n\nI was unsure about the war in Iraq when I voted in the presidential election. I thought about voting for George Bush because he started the war. It is hard to stop a war once it has started. But the US should think about the cost of the war. Many American soldiers have died, and it is hard to know when the war will end.\n\nThe main reason the US went to war in Iraq was for oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. This is not the only reason for war, but it is a big one. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. This was not the truth. The US government should be honest when making decisions about war.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon. I hope there will be peace in Iraq. But this may not happen.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always thought so. I believe it is a personal preference. Many people now think it has a biological reason, not a reason caused by how we are raised.\n\nIt is not fair to give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control. I think it is cruel. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think government and politics should be involved in this. This is a personal issue, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is silly for the government to try to decide what marriage is. Some people think that being gay is a chemical thing in the brain. It is not a choice. It is not caused by how someone is raised.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they can do it without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it is on the front page of the newspaper. I think it should be a personal matter, not a public issue.\n\nIs that all?",

But if someone found information that really helped, it's hard to say if they were looking randomly or if they were looking for something specific.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and I know that bad people can see things about me. I saw a TV show about a man who was able to find information about someone easily. He got her screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in a short time. It's hard to know who can see our information online.\n\nI try to limit what I post on Facebook, but it's hard to know who might be looking. I only accept people I know as friends, but I still don't know who might be looking at my information. I heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right or not.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It's a difficult topic, and I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up. But I'll try to be honest.\n\nAt first, I was against the war. Many people were against it. But it's not as important now. The main idea of the war was not a good one. Most people, including the United States government, now agree with this.\n\nIf we look at polls, we see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis want the United States to leave. Most American soldiers serving in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we entered. Now, it's a disaster. It's hard to fix the problem. There's a big difference in culture between the United States and the Middle East. This makes it difficult for the United States to understand what Iraqis want.\n\nSome people thought that democracy would work in Iraq. But Iraqis might have chosen a different way of living. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we have to think about the pros and cons before making big decisions.\n\nThe war has caused many problems. It's like quicksand - the more we stay, the deeper we get. I don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The US government might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I don't agree with them.\n\nIf we leave slowly over time, I wouldn't object to that. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. Many Iraqis think we should leave now. They are the people we're trying to help. If we ask them what they want, it's better to listen.\n\nIf we leave and things go wrong, we can say we tried to leave, but Iraqis asked us to stay. This way, we'll be the good guys. At least, we'll be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This is true in many workplaces. Women often face more challenges when looking for a job or trying to move up in their careers. \n\nOne big reason is that women are not seen as leaders in many industries. Even when women have all the qualifications for a job, they may not be chosen for it. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nMen can also face problems in certain jobs. For example, men who stay at home to take care of their children are often looked down upon. This is because society expects men to be the main breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think they are not experts on fashion because they are men.\n\nIt is difficult to change these attitudes. It takes time and effort. But things are getting better. More women are becoming leaders and being accepted in business. Men who stay at home to take care of their children are becoming more accepted too.\n\nWe can promote equality by showing the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. If we force people to accept change, they may resist. We need to be patient and let change happen naturally.\n\nPeople from different places and backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone who grew up on a farm and didn't have a good education may be looked down upon if they try to get a job in a big city. They may be judged on how they speak, not on their intelligence or skills.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a serious crime to have it. In some places, it was a big deal to have marijuana, but now it's not as bad. People who have marijuana can get a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and not get arrested. This is good because it saves money for the police and the court system. When someone gets a ticket for marijuana, it doesn't always hurt their future very much. But some people worry that even if it's decriminalized, it will still affect their life.\n\nSome people think it's better to not spend money on arresting people for marijuana. It costs a lot to arrest, book, and house people, and then to take them to court. It also costs money to pay a lawyer and the judge. If a community is in financial trouble, they might not want to change the laws about marijuana. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded and think it's okay.\n\nDecriminalizing marijuana can also help cities have more money for important things like education and helping people who are homeless. People should think about the money and the rules about marijuana.\n\nSome people worry that if marijuana is completely legal, it will be everywhere and people will smoke it all the time. This could be a problem because it's still not okay to smoke and drive. Also, many people still think smoking marijuana is not good. They might be uncomfortable if it's out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. They can affect how people think and how they act. But people are different and react to substances in different ways. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. It's hard to say how bad marijuana or alcohol is because people are different.",
            "I agree with this idea \nBecause \nMany people in this group do the same things for a long time \nThey have a strong past \nIt's good to remember the past, but we also need to change \nSome people must go to church every week \nThey have rules for doing things \nBut sometimes, they look down on people who don't follow the rules \nThey don't accept people who do not think the same way \nFor example \nMy mother is Episcopalian, my father is Episcopalian, but my mother is Catholic \nThey could not get married in a Catholic church because of my father's religion \n\nI think this is not very fair \nWe should love others, but we should also accept them \nThis is a teaching of the Catholic Church \nBut sometimes, they don't practice what they preach \n\nI don't think this would make a difference \nI think priests should be allowed to marry, but it might not stop some priests from doing bad things \nThey might still hurt children \n\nMost people who hurt children will do it no matter what \nIt's not the same as hurting a partner \nSo, we should not think that allowing priests to marry will stop it \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I have some thoughts on this issue, but I am not sure what to think. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a difficult problem because it involves two important things: the separation of church and state, and the definition of marriage.\n\nDefining marriage is hard because it involves many people's feelings and ideas. Some people think marriage should be looked at as a religious matter, while others think it should be a matter for the government. If marriage is a sacrament, then people might get special treatment from the government. For example, they might get tax breaks or other benefits.\n\nIf marriage is just a civil union, then people should not be judged by what kind of marriage they have. They should just be seen as two people who are together. This is what marriage is - two people who are united.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. It is simply a matter of two people who love each other and want to be together. They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, they should work to make it a federal law. But making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big enough issue to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not right to change the constitution just to ban something. We should not make big changes to the constitution without a good reason.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is just a matter of defining what marriage is and who should be able to get married.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes my feelings about homosexuality a little complicated.\n\nI have many gay friends, and I have thought about this issue a lot. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a major national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there, after all.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. This is why I believe it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush does not live in every state, so he should not tell each state how to make its own decisions. Some things are best left to individual states.\n\nThe president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will switch back and forth. It is better for each state to decide for itself.\n\nNo.",
            "I don't agree with this idea. Schools have the right to see what students post on the internet. Even if students are not posting under the school's name, officials can still see it if they try. They can check it at home or find it another way.\n\nThe main reason schools do this is to keep students safe. If they see something that could lead to trouble, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. I think it's okay for schools to do this.\n\nSome people might think it's wrong for schools to check the internet for students. But if it helps keep the school safe, I don't see a problem. Schools can check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking. They do this to catch students who are breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, if they are just checking the internet to get students in trouble, that is different. That's not okay. \n\nSchools have to make sure students are safe. They do this by practicing things like lockdowns and drills in case of emergencies like a terrorist attack. This is like what happened at Columbine. So, schools are just trying to make sure they can keep students safe.\n\nI think it's better for schools to check the internet to keep students safe. If they can prevent something bad from happening, that's a good thing.",
            "I have mixed feelings about going to war in a country. At first, I thought I wanted to go because my country was attacked on 9/11. However, I was young and emotional at the time. I wanted to fight back and cause problems in the country where the attack happened.\n\nBut, I think we made a mistake. We did not think carefully about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to the country without a clear plan and without being prepared for what we might face. This led to problems and made things worse.\n\nI now think that we should not have gotten involved. The people in the country were already fighting among themselves. We going in was not going to solve their problems. In fact, it made things more complicated.\n\nI think the people in the country are different from us. They think about war in a different way. They do not want to change their country to be more like ours. They are not looking to make their country better; they are looking for a way to get rid of us.\n\nI think we should have left them alone. We were not thinking clearly when we went to war. We were too emotional and angry. We were looking for revenge, not a way to solve problems.\n\nI believe that President Bush made a big mistake. He declared war without thinking carefully about what we were doing. He was under pressure from the people, but he should have been more careful.\n\nI don't think we could have avoided going to war, but we could have been more careful and planned better. We needed to have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve and how we were going to do it.\n\nBut, we did not have a good plan. We did not work together as a team. We did not think about the consequences of our actions. We just went in without thinking.\n\nIn the end, I think we are not the right people to change the country. They are too different from us. We are just making things worse by staying there. We need to leave and let them solve their own problems."

\nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "I think the Catholic Church needs to change in some ways. They have strict views on certain things. For example, they do not allow gay marriage. They also do not allow abortion and do not support birth control. Many people think these views are old-fashioned.\n\nSome people are leaving the Catholic Church because they disagree with these views. They believe the Church's views are not modern. The Church's views on gay marriage, abortion, and birth control make some people uncomfortable. They do not want to be part of a group that teaches these things are wrong.\n\nThe Catholic Church does not allow women to be priests or married. Many people do not understand why this is. They think it is unfair. But the Church says its priests are married to God. They must devote their lives to God. However, most people have jobs and families. They can balance work and family life. So, it is hard to see why priests cannot have both a job and a family.\n\nIf the Church were more open-minded, it might not lose followers. The Church could learn from other people's ideas and be more accepting. This might help it keep its members.\n\nIn the past, some bad things happened in the Catholic Church. People were hurt. It is hard to say if allowing priests to be married or having women priests would have prevented these bad things. But it is an idea to consider.\n\nOverall, I think the Catholic Church needs to be more open and accepting. This might help it keep its members and be more relevant in the world today.",
            "I do not have a problem with gay marriage. I think people are born a certain way. They did not choose to be gay. I do not think it is right to blame someone for their sexual orientation. I think it is not fair to say a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot.\n\nPeople are not born with a choice about how they feel. I was born straight. Another person might be born gay. We do not choose how we feel. I do not think the government should get involved. This is not a matter of law or morals. I do not think the government should tell people how to live their lives.\n\nThe government should not interfere with people's personal lives. Gay people are who they are. They were born that way. They should not be punished for it.\n\nI do not think the government should be involved in gay marriage. It is not a matter of national security or morals. The government should stay out of people's private lives.\n\nI believe people should be free to live their lives as they want. We are all different. We should respect each other's differences.",
            "I think gay marriage should be allowed. \n\nThere are no good reasons not to. \n\nMany people think that gay couples are a threat to the traditional family. But, this is not true. \n\nGay couples are not the same as traditional couples. It is like comparing two different things. They are like two different sides of the same coin. \n\nBut, they have the same rights. For example, property taxes and healthcare. If you are in a gay couple, your partner cannot visit you in the hospital if they are not considered family. \n\nThis is not fair. If you are going to spend your life with someone, they should have the same rights as others. \n\nMany studies have shown that gay couples are the same as traditional couples in terms of success and happiness. They have the same factors that make relationships work. \n\nThe thing that often gets people upset is that gay couples do not want to get married in a church. They just want a marriage certificate from the government. \n\nIf the government allows a civil union, why not a marriage? It is like segregation - separate but unequal. \n\nSome people worry about adoption and how it will affect the community. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nThey are the same as traditional couples in many ways. They have the same roles and responsibilities. \n\nPeople also worry about children of gay couples and how they will be treated by society. But, this is not a good reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nIn some cities, like New York City, there are special schools for children of gay parents because of bullying. But, this is not a reason to deny gay couples the right to marry. \n\nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in traditional couples. It is about personal choice. \n\nI think the federal government should make gay marriage legal in all states. The amendment to ban gay marriage is not fair. \n\nPresident Bush has strong views on gay marriage based on his religion. But, morality is different for everyone. The government should not make laws based on one group's morality. \n\nIt is hypocritical for the government to enforce laws that are based on one group's religion, but not others. \n\nSome people think that gay people are psychologically damaged or that their sexual orientation is a result of trauma. But, this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to research and not just popular opinion.",

I do not agree with this idea.\n\nI think medicines that are against the law should not be available to the public. However, I believe they can be very helpful for medical reasons. A medicine does not have to be against the law to be helpful.\n\nSome medicines that are against the law are used in pharmacies. We use these medicines because they are helpful. They are called controlled substances. People do not understand that some medicines against the law can be good for you.\n\nIf a medicine is against the law, it is not good just because it is against the law. Marijuana is against the law, but some medicines we use in pharmacies are also against the law. If people understand that some medicines against the law can be helpful, they might use marijuana responsibly.\n\nUsing marijuana can be bad if you use too much of it. However, using too much of any drug can be bad. It is not the same as drinking too much alcohol.\n\nI think it would be better to let people use marijuana responsibly, not all at once. We need to change the way people think about marijuana. Many people think marijuana is bad, but it is not as bad as some other medicines against the law, like heroin or cocaine.\n\nIf people understand that marijuana is not as bad as they think, they might use it for medical reasons. We should change the idea that marijuana is a bad medicine.",
            "I think the church has changed to adapt to the twenty-first century. It is not as strict as it used to be. I know this because I have grown up and attended church every Sunday as a child. I would wear nice dresses and matching shoes and a purse. This was my usual Sunday routine. I went to a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would go to church together. Now, the church has made some changes. They have created a special service for teenagers that is only thirty minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes. Families come late, and people wear jeans and khakis to the morning masses.\n\nI think the church has become more casual. This is the biggest change I have noticed. I do not understand the church's politics, but this is my view. I think the church is changing to make people feel more comfortable.\n\nSome people have accused Catholic priests of doing bad things with children. This is a serious problem. I do not think allowing female priests or married priests would have prevented these problems. Some men who are married still do bad things. Their choice to become a priest is what matters. Other religions have priests who can get married. For example, some preachers in the TV show \"7th Heaven\" are married. They have a choice to be married and practice their faith at the same time. If someone wants to get married and be a priest, they should choose a different faith.\n\nI think people are born with a certain way of being. I think it is true that some people have a problem with children because of their genetics. They cannot hide this by getting married. It will usually come out. The church cannot prevent this from happening if the person does not want to change. If the church knew and tried to hide it, that is wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.\n\nI do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic Church.",
            "I have some thoughts on the Iraq war. When the United States went into Iraq after the 9/11 attacks, it seemed like something was not right. Many people thought the war was connected to the 9/11 attacks, but it was later found that this was not true. \n\nThe US government said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction, but this was also found to be false. This made me very unhappy. The government seemed to be lying to the American people. Even Colin Powell, who gave a big presentation at the UN, later said he was not sure about the evidence. This is serious. I think it is wrong for the government to lie to the people.\n\nThe US government seems to have little respect for the Constitution. They have been trying to limit its power since 9/11. When President Bush took office, he wanted to go to war. A high government official said that the president's son George W. Bush wanted to go to war with Iraq because of his father's problems with Saddam Hussein.\n\nSome people think the war was started for a reason other than to keep the US safe. They think it was also about oil. This is a problem in itself. \n\nThe war has gone on for a long time. If the US leaves now, there is a chance that the country will fall into civil war. Many more people might die. To avoid this, the US and the UN are planning to bring in other countries to help restore order. However, this might cause more problems in the long run. \n\nThe new government in Iraq is not working well. The people in charge do not have control. A group that was fighting against the US a year ago now has many seats in the government. This is causing problems and making it hard to make decisions.\n\nI do not have a clear solution to this problem.",

I know that the US is trying to build a democracy in Iraq, so it can be like the US. The US also wants oil from Iraq. \n\nHowever, I do not think this is a good reason to stay in Iraq. It is causing problems for the people there. If the US stays, it will take a long time to build a democracy. But if the US leaves, the Iraqis will be upset with us. They will have to start over again.\n\nI do not know what to say about the war. I think it is complicated. I know some families who have sons and daughters in Iraq. I want the war to end so they can come home safely. However, I also think that if we stay in Iraq, we will be trying to change their culture to be like ours. This could make things worse for them.\n\nI think the group Al-Kaida will become even stronger if we stay in Iraq. They will be angry with the US because we are trying to change their way of life.

The Constitution also says there should be no interference between the government and church.

The Constitution is like a set of rules for the government. It is written and should be followed. I do not think it is right for the government to decide which church is right or wrong.\n\nThe separation of church and state is very important in the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. Even though some people want to add a new rule to the Constitution, I do not think it is right. It would be against what the Constitution already says.\n\nI do not think the government should decide what is right or wrong for churches. That is up to the churches themselves. I do not see why the president is pushing for this rule. It seems to be because he does not like something that many churches do.\n\nThe president's rule is not fair. It favors one church over others. I do not think that is right. The government should not interfere with what the churches do. I do not see how this rule will help the country. If anything, it might help our society. \n\nI have said what I think. That is my opinion.",
            "The war in Iraq was a difficult decision for the US government. They did not tell the American people the whole truth about why they wanted to go to war. The government said the invasion of Iraq was connected to the September 11th terrorist attacks. However, this was not true. The American people were angry after the attacks, and the government used this anger to make the invasion seem necessary.\n\nI do not like war. I do not think the US government was prepared for the war in Iraq. The government did not think about the problems that would happen after they took down the Iraqi government. Many American soldiers died in the war. This is very sad.\n\nThe US removed the Iraqi government and tried to create a new one. They wanted to bring democracy to Iraq. But this is very hard to do. It took many years for democracy to develop in the US. There were many struggles and a civil war.\n\nThe US government made the war in Iraq seem easy. But it is not easy to create a new government. The government should have thought about the problems that would happen after the war. They should have been honest with the American people about the war.\n\nIt is hard to decide whether the US should stay in Iraq or leave. The US took away the Iraqi government and now they are responsible for the country. Many American soldiers have died in the war. The US should think about how many more soldiers will die if they stay in Iraq.\n\nI was unsure about the war in Iraq when I voted in the presidential election. I thought about voting for George Bush because he started the war. It is hard to stop a war once it has started. But the US should think about the cost of the war. Many American soldiers have died, and it is hard to know when the war will end.\n\nThe main reason the US went to war in Iraq was for oil. The US wants to control the oil in Iraq. This is not the only reason for war, but it is a big one. The US said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, but they were not found. This was not the truth. The US government should be honest when making decisions about war.\n\nI hope the war in Iraq will end soon. I hope there will be peace in Iraq. But this may not happen.",
            "I am in favor of gay marriage. I have always thought so. I believe it is a personal preference. Many people now think it has a biological reason, not a reason caused by how we are raised.\n\nIt is not fair to give people fewer rights because of something they cannot control. I think it is cruel. I have always supported gay marriage.\n\nI do not think government and politics should be involved in this. This is a personal issue, not a state or government issue. In my neighborhood, there are openly gay couples who are not married because they are not allowed. But they live like any other family. They walk their dogs down the street like anyone else.\n\nI think it is silly for the government to try to decide what marriage is. Some people think that being gay is a chemical thing in the brain. It is not a choice. It is not caused by how someone is raised.\n\nMarriage is a personal thing. If two people want to get married, they can do it without anyone knowing. But if two gay people want to get married, it is on the front page of the newspaper. I think it should be a personal matter, not a public issue.\n\nIs that all?",

But if someone found information that really helped, it's hard to say if they were looking randomly or if they were looking for something specific.\n\nI have a Facebook account, and I know that bad people can see things about me. I saw a TV show about a man who was able to find information about someone easily. He got her screen name and talked to her on instant messenger in a short time. It's hard to know who can see our information online.\n\nI try to limit what I post on Facebook, but it's hard to know who might be looking. I only accept people I know as friends, but I still don't know who might be looking at my information. I heard about a school that banned students from having Myspace. I'm not sure if that's right or not.",
            "I want to talk about the Iraq War. It's a difficult topic, and I feel a bit hypocritical bringing it up. But I'll try to be honest.\n\nAt first, I was against the war. Many people were against it. But it's not as important now. The main idea of the war was not a good one. Most people, including the United States government, now agree with this.\n\nIf we look at polls, we see that 75 to 80 percent of the world thinks the war was a bad idea. Even 80 percent of Iraqis want the United States to leave. Most American soldiers serving in Iraq also think the war was a bad idea.\n\nThe situation in Iraq was already bad before we entered. Now, it's a disaster. It's hard to fix the problem. There's a big difference in culture between the United States and the Middle East. This makes it difficult for the United States to understand what Iraqis want.\n\nSome people thought that democracy would work in Iraq. But Iraqis might have chosen a different way of living. Saddam Hussein was a bad leader, but we have to think about the pros and cons before making big decisions.\n\nThe war has caused many problems. It's like quicksand - the more we stay, the deeper we get. I don't see a good reason to stay in Iraq. The US government might have some ideas about why we should stay, but I don't agree with them.\n\nIf we leave slowly over time, I wouldn't object to that. But I don't see a reason to stay any longer than necessary. Many Iraqis think we should leave now. They are the people we're trying to help. If we ask them what they want, it's better to listen.\n\nIf we leave and things go wrong, we can say we tried to leave, but Iraqis asked us to stay. This way, we'll be the good guys. At least, we'll be better than we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with men and women being treated unfairly in the United States. This is true in many workplaces. Women often face more challenges when looking for a job or trying to move up in their careers. \n\nOne big reason is that women are not seen as leaders in many industries. Even when women have all the qualifications for a job, they may not be chosen for it. This is because of how society has been for a long time.\n\nMen can also face problems in certain jobs. For example, men who stay at home to take care of their children are often looked down upon. This is because society expects men to be the main breadwinners.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men who like fashion are often not taken seriously. People may think they are not experts on fashion because they are men.\n\nIt is difficult to change these attitudes. It takes time and effort. But things are getting better. More women are becoming leaders and being accepted in business. Men who stay at home to take care of their children are becoming more accepted too.\n\nWe can promote equality by showing the good qualities of people who are often discriminated against. If we force people to accept change, they may resist. We need to be patient and let change happen naturally.\n\nPeople from different places and backgrounds can also face discrimination. For example, someone who grew up on a farm and didn't have a good education may be looked down upon if they try to get a job in a big city. They may be judged on how they speak, not on their intelligence or skills.",
            "Decriminalizing marijuana means making it not a serious crime to have it. In some places, it was a big deal to have marijuana, but now it's not as bad. People who have marijuana can get a ticket, like a traffic ticket, and not get arrested. This is good because it saves money for the police and the court system. When someone gets a ticket for marijuana, it doesn't always hurt their future very much. But some people worry that even if it's decriminalized, it will still affect their life.\n\nSome people think it's better to not spend money on arresting people for marijuana. It costs a lot to arrest, book, and house people, and then to take them to court. It also costs money to pay a lawyer and the judge. If a community is in financial trouble, they might not want to change the laws about marijuana. But some places, like Denver, are more open-minded and think it's okay.\n\nDecriminalizing marijuana can also help cities have more money for important things like education and helping people who are homeless. People should think about the money and the rules about marijuana.\n\nSome people worry that if marijuana is completely legal, it will be everywhere and people will smoke it all the time. This could be a problem because it's still not okay to smoke and drive. Also, many people still think smoking marijuana is not good. They might be uncomfortable if it's out in the open.\n\nBoth marijuana and alcohol can be bad for people. They can affect how people think and how they act. But people are different and react to substances in different ways. Some people can control how much they use, and some people can't. It's hard to say how bad marijuana or alcohol is because people are different.",
            "I agree with this idea \nBecause \nMany people in this group do the same things for a long time \nThey have a strong past \nIt's good to remember the past, but we also need to change \nSome people must go to church every week \nThey have rules for doing things \nBut sometimes, they look down on people who don't follow the rules \nThey don't accept people who do not think the same way \nFor example \nMy mother is Episcopalian, my father is Episcopalian, but my mother is Catholic \nThey could not get married in a Catholic church because of my father's religion \n\nI think this is not very fair \nWe should love others, but we should also accept them \nThis is a teaching of the Catholic Church \nBut sometimes, they don't practice what they preach \n\nI don't think this would make a difference \nI think priests should be allowed to marry, but it might not stop some priests from doing bad things \nThey might still hurt children \n\nMost people who hurt children will do it no matter what \nIt's not the same as hurting a partner \nSo, we should not think that allowing priests to marry will stop it \n\nI don't think so.",
            "I have some thoughts on this issue, but I am not sure what to think. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a difficult problem because it involves two important things: the separation of church and state, and the definition of marriage.\n\nDefining marriage is hard because it involves many people's feelings and ideas. Some people think marriage should be looked at as a religious matter, while others think it should be a matter for the government. If marriage is a sacrament, then people might get special treatment from the government. For example, they might get tax breaks or other benefits.\n\nIf marriage is just a civil union, then people should not be judged by what kind of marriage they have. They should just be seen as two people who are together. This is what marriage is - two people who are united.\n\nThe issue of gay marriage is also important. It is simply a matter of two people who love each other and want to be together. They should be able to have a civil union just like anyone else.\n\nIf all the states can agree on this, they should work to make it a federal law. But making a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. It is not a big enough issue to change the constitution.\n\nIt is not right to change the constitution just to ban something. We should not make big changes to the constitution without a good reason.\n\nI do not think it is important enough to change the constitution to ban gay marriage. It is just a matter of defining what marriage is and who should be able to get married.",
            "I was raised in a Christian home. This makes my feelings about homosexuality a little complicated.\n\nI have many gay friends, and I have thought about this issue a lot. I do not agree with all parts of the gay lifestyle. However, I think it should be legal. I do not think it should be a major national issue. Instead, each state should decide for itself.\n\nSome states are democratic, and some are republican. Democratic states tend to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect the decision. You chose to live there, after all.\n\nI think homosexuals should have the same rights as everyone else. This is why I believe it should be up to each state to decide.\n\nI already said that.\n\nI do not think the president should decide for the whole country. George Bush does not live in every state, so he should not tell each state how to make its own decisions. Some things are best left to individual states.\n\nThe president will not be in office forever. If a new president wants to change the law, it will switch back and forth. It is better for each state to decide for itself.\n\nNo.",
            "I don't agree with this idea. Schools have the right to see what students post on the internet. Even if students are not posting under the school's name, officials can still see it if they try. They can check it at home or find it another way.\n\nThe main reason schools do this is to keep students safe. If they see something that could lead to trouble, they can stop it. This is their responsibility. I think it's okay for schools to do this.\n\nSome people might think it's wrong for schools to check the internet for students. But if it helps keep the school safe, I don't see a problem. Schools can check the internet to see if students are doing things they shouldn't be doing, like drinking or smoking. They do this to catch students who are breaking the rules.\n\nHowever, if they are just checking the internet to get students in trouble, that is different. That's not okay. \n\nSchools have to make sure students are safe. They do this by practicing things like lockdowns and drills in case of emergencies like a terrorist attack. This is like what happened at Columbine. So, schools are just trying to make sure they can keep students safe.\n\nI think it's better for schools to check the internet to keep students safe. If they can prevent something bad from happening, that's a good thing.",
            "I have mixed feelings about going to war in a country. At first, I thought I wanted to go because my country was attacked on 9/11. However, I was young and emotional at the time. I wanted to fight back and cause problems in the country where the attack happened.\n\nBut, I think we made a mistake. We did not think carefully about the long-term effects of our actions. We went to the country without a clear plan and without being prepared for what we might face. This led to problems and made things worse.\n\nI now think that we should not have gotten involved. The people in the country were already fighting among themselves. We going in was not going to solve their problems. In fact, it made things more complicated.\n\nI think the people in the country are different from us. They think about war in a different way. They do not want to change their country to be more like ours. They are not looking to make their country better; they are looking for a way to get rid of us.\n\nI think we should have left them alone. We were not thinking clearly when we went to war. We were too emotional and angry. We were looking for revenge, not a way to solve problems.\n\nI believe that President Bush made a big mistake. He declared war without thinking carefully about what we were doing. He was under pressure from the people, but he should have been more careful.\n\nI don't think we could have avoided going to war, but we could have been more careful and planned better. We needed to have a clear idea of what we wanted to achieve and how we were going to do it.\n\nBut, we did not have a good plan. We did not work together as a team. We did not think about the consequences of our actions. We just went in without thinking.\n\nIn the end, I think we are not the right people to change the country. They are too different from us. We are just making things worse by staying there. We need to leave and let them solve their own problems."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",
            "Um \nWell first off I work in a hospital pharmacy over the summer and \nYou know \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean it has beneficial properties \nUm \nSo \nI mean as far as \nHaving it available for the public I’d say no \nAbsolutely no \nBut \nUsing it for medicinal purposes I’d say yes \nBecause \nJust because a drug is illegal doesn’t mean its beneficial \nIt’s not beneficial \nYou know what I mean \n\nYeah \nUm \nI mean there are a bunch of drugs that are illegal that pharmacies use \nLike oxycotton \nUm \nVicodin \nPerocets \nThat kind of thing \nAnd those are controlled substances \nBut we use them all the time because they’re beneficial and if you deny that those benefits \nJust because there’s a taboo around marijuana then \nA \nThere’s no point in doing that for me \nYou should embrace its beneficial properties I think \n\nUm \nI don’t think it’s that similar to alcohol cause marijuana if you abuse it it \nAlthough if you abuse alcohol too that can lead to bad things \nUm \nIt’s a tough one \nI’d say \nNot \nYou could integrate it \nLike let it become legal gradually but not all at once \nBecause then it would be abused but if you just \nYou gotta remove that taboo around marijuana first \nAnd then people might use it responsibly \n\nUh \nYeah \nUm \nPeople have such a bad image on marijuana because it’s an illegal drug \nBut \nI mean it’s not that bad for you \nIt’s not like heroine or cocaine or something like that \nUm \nSo \nI mean if we get rid of that image of marijuana as being this horrible thing then people might be able to use it responsibly \nAnd certainly for medical purposes \n\nNope \n\n\n",
            "Um \nI think the church already has changed to adapt to the twenty first century \nUm \nIt’s not as strict as it used to be \nI know even as I’ve grown up when I was younger I would always go to church every Sunday \nAnd \nI would get cute little dresses \nAnd \nMatching shoes \nAnd \nA matching purse \nAnd \nThat was just every all my \nI went to a private school \nAnd \nI would see all my friends there on the weekends \nAnd \nWe would just go \nBut \nNow as I’ve gotten older they’ve made like a teenager mass \nAnd \nThey cut it down to thirty minutes \nAnd \nPeople dress a lot more casual \nDuring summer especially people would come in their beach clothes like straight from the beach \nYou’d have the families there that are just running in late \nSo I think it has become more casual \nEven at the morning masses where I used to always get dressed up \nPeople are wearing jeans and khakis \nWell khakis are nice too \nBut \nJust a lot more causal in respect to that \nAs for other things \nThat’s the biggest thing that I noticed \nLike \nThat’s the church I know \nI don’t know the politics into the church and what not \nBut \nYeah \nThat’s it \n[OK um regarding all of the accusations against catholic priests dealing with pedophilia, do you think that these could have been prevented if the church changed for example allowing female priests or allowing priests to marry?]\nUm \nI don’t think that these things could have been avoided \nBecause \nThere are men who are married \nAnd \nThey still become pedophiles \nAnd \nThey still have \nUh \nAn attraction towards young kids \nSo \nI think even if you got them married it’s just the person it’s not because they’re allowed to get married or not allowed to get married \nUm \nI think also when they’re becoming a priest it’s their choice to become a priest \nUm \nThere are religions that they’re allowed to get married where they could be \nLike on Seventh Heaven \nI don’t know what kind of \nHe’s a reverend or a minister or something \n[Mm hmm]\nBut \nThey’re allowed to get married \nSo \nI know it’s a little different \nBut \nIf they really wanted to practice their faith and be married at the same time then they should maybe think about a different faith \n[OK can you elaborate on your answer a little bit more?]\nUm \nOn which part \nAbout \n[Um]\nJust the changing ways \n[That it really wouldn’t make a difference I guess]\nOh on the pedophilia \n[Mm hmm]\nUm \nI think \nLike the whole \nUm \nSexuality before about being genetics \nI think it’s based on genetics \nI don’t think people \nUm \nJust become it \nI think they’re born that way \nI don’t think it has anything to do with the way they’re brought up \nIt might have something to do a little more in this case \nBut \nI think it’s their genetics \nAnd \nYou can’t hide that through a marriage \nYou could try \nBut \nThen it would usually come out \nSo \nI don’t think the church could have done anything to prevent this from happening \nUm \nIf they know about it and were trying to cover it up then shame on them \nBut \nI don’t think in all cases they knew \n[OK do you have any other thoughts concerning the catholic church?]\nUm no \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Many people have been saying this because the Church does not accept some things. Like gay marriages and abortion. The Church has strong views on these topics, but they are old-fashioned in some ways.\n\nIf the Church changed its ideas a little, it would not lose followers. People are turning away from the Church because of its views on these issues. Some people do not agree with the Church on things like this.\n\nFor example, the Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you will not be comfortable in a Church where it is considered wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or priests to be married. This might not have stopped problems in the Church, but it could have helped. Maybe priests would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or have a family.\n\nThe Church says its priests are married to God and devote their lives to the Church. But other people can have a job and a family life. There is no reason priests cannot have both.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I think it is not wrong for two people of the same sex to get married. People are born gay. It is not a choice. They should not be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It is not right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot.\n\nI think it is not a choice. People are born straight or gay. It is not something they can change. I was born straight and I know people are born gay. They should not be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of law. It is not a moral issue either. People should be free to be who they are. They should not be judged or punished for being gay.\n\nThe federal government should not interfere with people's personal lives. They should let people make their own choices. Being gay is not a bad thing. It is just a part of who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government has no right to tell people what to do. They should not try to control people's lives. Gays are people too. They deserve respect and freedom.",

This should not be a problem. \n\nIt is like segregation. Separate and unequal is not fair. \n\nPeople are worried about adoption and how children will be treated. But this is not a reason to keep gay couples from marrying. \n\nGay parents love their children just like straight parents do. They make the same decisions and have the same feelings. \n\nWe should not judge people based on their choices. We should let them be who they are. \n\nThe government should make sure gay marriage is allowed everywhere. The law should be fair for everyone. \n\nPresident Bush has his own opinions on this issue. He thinks it is against his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's opinions. \n\nWe should consider what is fair and what is right. The government should not just follow what some people believe. \n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality problem. But this is not true.

            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You may wonder why I think marijuana should be legal. The reason is simple – a drug being illegal does not mean it has no good effects. While I do not think it should be available to the public, I believe it can be useful for medical purposes.\n\nMany medicines used in pharmacies are illegal, but they are still used because they are helpful. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they are used because they are beneficial. Marijuana may have beneficial effects, but it is not available because of a negative image. I think we should look at the good things marijuana can do and understand it better.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. While abusing marijuana can be bad, abusing alcohol can also cause problems. But we can use marijuana responsibly. To do this, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. If we make it legal, people may use it wisely.\n\nThe problem is that many people think marijuana is bad because it is illegal. But it is not as bad as heroine or cocaine. If we can change this image, people may use marijuana responsibly for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed in recent years to become more like the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church on Sundays. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend the early mass. But now, the church has a special service for teenagers, called a teenager mass. The service is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes right from the beach. Families sometimes arrive late. The church has become more casual, even for morning masses. I used to wear nice clothes, but now people wear jeans and khakis. This is the main thing I have noticed about the church.\n\nAs for other things, that is all I know about the church. I do not know about the politics inside the church. I am not sure about the church's rules and decisions.\n\nI do not think the church's rules about marriage and being a priest would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. There are men who are married but still have these problems. It is not because they are allowed to get married or not that causes the problem, but because of the person themselves. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can get married.\n\nI think the problem of pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with these tendencies, and it is not something they become because of how they are raised. Genetics play a role, and you cannot hide this through marriage. It may come out eventually. The church may not be able to prevent this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the problems and tried to cover them up, that would be wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases.

The country was in chaos. \n\nThe US government thought it could easily put in a new government and make it work. But, it was not easy. It is not easy to make a new government in any country.

They are trying to help the Iraqi people, but it is a long and hard process. The US government should have thought about this before going to war.\n\nThis is a difficult decision. Once the US went to war, it was hard to leave. The US took control of Iraq and its government. The US should not just leave now. But, the US is losing many soldiers. How many is too many? \n\nWe should think about why the US went to war. The US is not helping all the countries that need help.

But now, I think we have lost sight of that goal. We are fighting just to show we are strong.\n\nPerhaps the reasons for the war were questionable from the start. We have seen examples of this in the past, like what happened with Iraq and Saddam Hussein. If our goal was to help another country, that is a good reason to go to war.

It seems like we are fighting just to fight. We do not want to lose the war.\n\nI think the war has gone on long enough. The country we are fighting will have to take care of itself soon. We have our own problems to solve, like poverty and poor education. We should be spending money on those things, not on a long war.\n\nWe are spending billions of dollars on this war.

We should be spending money on those things, not on a war that has lost its purpose.\n\nMoney that is being spent on the war could be used to help our own people. We have many citizens who are struggling. It is not fair that we are spending their tax money on a war in a foreign country.",
            "You want to ask a question to clarify something. You wanted to know if it was okay that someone found information about you on the internet. This person found it on a website called Myspace. Myspace is a place where people can share information about themselves. Anyone can see the information if they are friends with you on the site. That means you gave permission for them to see your information.\n\nWhen you put information on the internet, many people can see it. It is like showing your information to a lot of people. You should be careful about what you share online. You don't know who might see it.\n\nYou think it was good that someone found the information and it helped prevent something bad from happening. But you also think it's not fair to have someone looking at everyone's information all the time. It's not fair to judge people based on what they share online.\n\nYou have a social media account called Facebook. You are careful about what you share, but you also want to be able to communicate with your friends. It's hard to know who can see your information on the internet.\n\nYou know of someone who went to a school where students were not allowed to have Myspace accounts. You don't think the school had the right to tell students what they can and cannot do online.",
            "I am thinking about the Iraq War. This is a difficult subject. Many people think it was a bad idea. Some of them were against it from the beginning. I am also against it. I was against it from the beginning.\n\nMost people do not agree with the decision to go to war. Seventy-five percent of people in the United States, Iraq, and the world think it was not a good idea. Even many soldiers who are in Iraq now think it was a bad decision. They want to leave soon.\n\nThe war has been very difficult. Many people think it was a disaster from the start. We should not have gone there. Now, leaving is also a problem. There is no easy way to fix the situation.\n\nThe United States and Middle Eastern countries have different cultures. It is hard for us to understand each other. We thought we could bring democracy to Iraq, but it is not the way they want to live.\n\nSaddam Hussein was a bad leader. However, we should not have invaded the country. We should have thought about the consequences before we went in.\n\nI do not see a reason to stay in Iraq. The administration may have some reasons, but I do not agree with them. If they want to leave gradually, that is okay. But I do not see why we cannot leave now.\n\nMany Iraqis want us to leave. At least eighty percent of them think we should be gone within a year. If we ask them what to do, they say leave. This makes sense. If things go badly, we can say we were following their decision.\n\nIf we leave, we will be seen as trying to help. It is not a perfect solution, but it is better than where we are now.",
            "I think there is still a problem with fairness between men and women in the United States. This problem is not just for women, but also for people in certain jobs. Women often have a harder time advancing in their work because of a problem called the \"glass ceiling.\" This means that people may not choose women for higher positions, even if they are qualified. This is because women are not usually in charge in business.\n\nMen also have problems in certain jobs, like working at home with their children. Some people think it is not good for a man to stay home and take care of the children. They think men should work and earn money for their family. But this can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are not always taken seriously if they like fashion. People may think that men who like fashion are not like other men. They may not understand what men in the fashion industry are doing.\n\nBut I think things are getting better. More women are becoming successful in business and are being accepted as leaders. And more men are staying home to take care of their children. This is good because it shows that people are changing their minds.\n\nTo make things fairer, we need to show that everyone has good qualities, not just the ones that people expect. If we do not push too hard, people will not resist the change. We should just show the good qualities of people who are different.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. I think we are at a good point where people are starting to accept differences.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against because of where they are from or how they talk. For example, if someone has poor grammar but is very smart, people may not believe what they say. This can happen to men and women.",
            "I think I understand the situation. They made marijuana use not a crime. This means that people who use it will not go to jail. Instead, they will get a ticket, like a traffic ticket. This can be a problem for people who want a job or other opportunities. It can affect their lives in many ways.\n\nSome people think that making marijuana use not a crime saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for lawyers and judges. When towns have little money, they may not want to do this.\n\nHowever, in some places, like Denver, people are open-minded about marijuana. They think it is okay to use it. This town has more money now to spend on good things, like education and help for the elderly and homeless people.\n\nBut there are reasons why marijuana should not be everywhere. It is not good to have people smoking it and driving. And in many places, people do not like it. They think it is not right to use it openly.\n\nAlcohol can hurt people's driving skills. Marijuana can hurt people's lives in other ways, like how they act and think. But people are different, and they react to things in different ways.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But it can be bad for some people. We should be careful about how we use it.",
            "I agree with the things they do. \nBecause \nThey have done them for a long time. \nTheir customs are good, but it is also important to change. \nI think so. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey have rules about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules. \nThey also do not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were different religions. \nMy mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them. \nThis is not being kind to others. \nCatholics learn to love others. \nBut it is not kind to not accept others. \n\nI do not think that changing one thing would help. \nFor example, if priests could get married, some might still hurt children. \nThis is not because they are married, but because they want to hurt children. \n\nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt is not because they are married. \nThey will hurt children because they want to. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop this. \nI think it would still happen.",
            "This is a difficult issue. I do not have an opinion on this matter yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a confusing problem. It is hard to solve without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is between government and church. Marriage is a big problem to define. This is because marriage is a special event for some people. They consider it a sacrament. If we look at marriage in this way, people might not get special tax breaks or government help if they are not baptized.\n\nIf two people are married, I think the government should just see it as a civil union. This is because marriage is two people together. The government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is.\n\nSome people think marriage should be between a man and a woman. Others think it should be between two people who love each other. This is a hard problem to solve.\n\nIf all states can agree on what to do, then they should make it a national law. But changing the US Constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The Constitution should not be changed for a small group of people.\n\nThis issue is not big enough to change the Constitution. It is not important enough to make a law that says who can get married and who cannot.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. I respect people with different beliefs. Homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with all of their choices, but I believe they should be free to live as they wish. I don't think it's the government's job to decide. Each state should decide its own laws.\n\nMy friends and I talk about this. Some states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect its decision.\n\nI think gay people should have the same rights as everyone else. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. I don't think the president should make a decision for the whole country.\n\nPresident Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state is run. Each state should be allowed to make its own decisions.\n\nSome things should be up to each individual state. The president's decision is temporary and can be changed by the next president. States will have to live with their own decisions, not the president.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I don’t agree with this idea. Posting on Myspace is a public thing. You post something for everyone to see. If you do that on the internet, people will see it, even school officials. They can see it from their homes.\n\nSchool officials should be able to see what students post online. This can help keep students safe. For example, if they find students posting about drinking or smoking, they can stop them. This is a school’s job: to keep students safe.\n\nBut I don’t think it’s right for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students. If they want to do that, it’s an invasion of privacy. However, if it makes the school safer, that’s okay.\n\nI think it’s a good idea for school officials to go online to make sure students are safe. They can check Myspace to stop students from doing bad things. This is like the school’s drill practice for when there might be a problem.\n\nSchool officials want to keep students safe, like after the Columbine incident. They do this to prevent something bad from happening. I think this is a good thing.",
            "I don't agree with the war in the Middle East. I was personally affected by 9/11. But now I think we should not be there. We did not think about the long-term effects of the war. We went to the war quickly without a good plan. This made things worse for us.\n\nWe should not be in the Middle East. The people there are fighting each other. They cannot fight with us if they cannot agree with themselves. We cannot help them by being there. We went to the war without being prepared. We did not know what we would face.\n\nWar is different in the Middle East. They fight in a way that is not like our way. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave and let them handle their own problems.\n\nWe were not thinking clearly before we went to war. We were angry and wanted revenge. We did not think about what could happen. We just wanted to fight. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq because many people wanted to. But we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not know what we were doing. We did not have unity. We did not know what we wanted to achieve. This made things worse. I think we should not be in the Middle East. We are not making progress. We are hurting ourselves by being there. We cannot stay there forever. When we leave, things will fall apart."

            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Many people have been saying this because the Church does not accept some things. Like gay marriages and abortion. The Church has strong views on these topics, but they are old-fashioned in some ways.\n\nIf the Church changed its ideas a little, it would not lose followers. People are turning away from the Church because of its views on these issues. Some people do not agree with the Church on things like this.\n\nFor example, the Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you will not be comfortable in a Church where it is considered wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or priests to be married. This might not have stopped problems in the Church, but it could have helped. Maybe priests would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or have a family.\n\nThe Church says its priests are married to God and devote their lives to the Church. But other people can have a job and a family life. There is no reason priests cannot have both.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I think it is not wrong for two people of the same sex to get married. People are born gay. It is not a choice. They should not be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It is not right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot.\n\nI think it is not a choice. People are born straight or gay. It is not something they can change. I was born straight and I know people are born gay. They should not be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of law. It is not a moral issue either. People should be free to be who they are. They should not be judged or punished for being gay.\n\nThe federal government should not interfere with people's personal lives. They should let people make their own choices. Being gay is not a bad thing. It is just a part of who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government has no right to tell people what to do. They should not try to control people's lives. Gays are people too. They deserve respect and freedom.",

Every couple is different. \n\nGay couples are like heterosexual couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of love. \n\nGay couples want a marriage certificate from the government, not a marriage in a church. This should not be a problem. \n\nIt is like segregation. Separate and unequal is not fair. \n\nPeople are worried about adoption and how children will be treated. But this is not a reason to keep gay couples from marrying. \n\nGay parents love their children just like straight parents do. They make the same decisions and have the same feelings. \n\nWe should not judge people based on their choices. We should let them be who they are. \n\nThe government should make sure gay marriage is allowed everywhere. The law should be fair for everyone. \n\nPresident Bush has his own opinions on this issue. He thinks it is against his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's opinions. \n\nWe should consider what is fair and what is right. The government should not just follow what some people believe. \n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality problem. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just what people think. \n\nWe should treat everyone equally and with respect. This is what we want for our country.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You may wonder why I think marijuana should be legal. The reason is simple – a drug being illegal does not mean it has no good effects. While I do not think it should be available to the public, I believe it can be useful for medical purposes.\n\nMany medicines used in pharmacies are illegal, but they are still used because they are helpful. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they are used because they are beneficial. Marijuana may have beneficial effects, but it is not available because of a negative image. I think we should look at the good things marijuana can do and understand it better.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. While abusing marijuana can be bad, abusing alcohol can also cause problems. But we can use marijuana responsibly. To do this, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. If we make it legal, people may use it wisely.\n\nThe problem is that many people think marijuana is bad because it is illegal. But it is not as bad as heroine or cocaine. If we can change this image, people may use marijuana responsibly for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed in recent years to become more like the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church on Sundays. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend the early mass. But now, the church has a special service for teenagers, called a teenager mass. The service is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes right from the beach. Families sometimes arrive late. The church has become more casual, even for morning masses. I used to wear nice clothes, but now people wear jeans and khakis. This is the main thing I have noticed about the church.\n\nAs for other things, that is all I know about the church. I do not know about the politics inside the church. I am not sure about the church's rules and decisions.\n\nI do not think the church's rules about marriage and being a priest would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. There are men who are married but still have these problems. It is not because they are allowed to get married or not that causes the problem, but because of the person themselves. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can get married.\n\nI think the problem of pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with these tendencies, and it is not something they become because of how they are raised. Genetics play a role, and you cannot hide this through marriage. It may come out eventually. The church may not be able to prevent this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the problems and tried to cover them up, that would be wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases. I do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

The constitution says the government should not choose which churches are good or bad. Most Catholics and Christians do not agree with it. But this should not be a decision for the government to make.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. The government should not make laws about what churches can or cannot do. Even if there was a new law, it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this law. It's because of his own personal feelings.

The country was in chaos. \n\nThe US government thought it could easily put in a new government and make it work. But, it was not easy. It is not easy to make a new government in any country.

They are trying to help the Iraqi people, but it is a long and hard process. The US government should have thought about this before going to war.\n\nThis is a difficult decision. Once the US went to war, it was hard to leave. The US took control of Iraq and its government. The US should not just leave now. But, the US is losing many soldiers. How many is too many? \n\nWe should think about why the US went to war. The US is not helping all the countries that need help.

Women often have a harder time advancing in their work because of a problem called the \"glass ceiling.\" This means that people may not choose women for higher positions, even if they are qualified. This is because women are not usually in charge in business.\n\nMen also have problems in certain jobs, like working at home with their children. Some people think it is not good for a man to stay home and take care of the children. They think men should work and earn money for their family. But this can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are not always taken seriously if they like fashion. People may think that men who like fashion are not like other men. They may not understand what men in the fashion industry are doing.\n\nBut I think things are getting better. More women are becoming successful in business and are being accepted as leaders. And more men are staying home to take care of their children. This is good because it shows that people are changing their minds.\n\nTo make things fairer, we need to show that everyone has good qualities, not just the ones that people expect. If we do not push too hard, people will not resist the change. We should just show the good qualities of people who are different.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. I think we are at a good point where people are starting to accept differences.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against because of where they are from or how they talk. For example, if someone has poor grammar but is very smart, people may not believe what they say. This can happen to men and women.",
            "I think I understand the situation. They made marijuana use not a crime. This means that people who use it will not go to jail. Instead, they will get a ticket, like a traffic ticket. This can be a problem for people who want a job or other opportunities. It can affect their lives in many ways.\n\nSome people think that making marijuana use not a crime saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for lawyers and judges. When towns have little money, they may not want to do this.\n\nHowever, in some places, like Denver, people are open-minded about marijuana. They think it is okay to use it. This town has more money now to spend on good things, like education and help for the elderly and homeless people.\n\nBut there are reasons why marijuana should not be everywhere. It is not good to have people smoking it and driving. And in many places, people do not like it. They think it is not right to use it openly.\n\nAlcohol can hurt people's driving skills. Marijuana can hurt people's lives in other ways, like how they act and think. But people are different, and they react to things in different ways.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But it can be bad for some people. We should be careful about how we use it.",
            "I agree with the things they do. \nBecause \nThey have done them for a long time. \nTheir customs are good, but it is also important to change. \nI think so. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey have rules about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules. \nThey also do not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were different religions. \nMy mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them. \nThis is not being kind to others. \nCatholics learn to love others. \nBut it is not kind to not accept others. \n\nI do not think that changing one thing would help. \nFor example, if priests could get married, some might still hurt children. \nThis is not because they are married, but because they want to hurt children. \n\nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt is not because they are married. \nThey will hurt children because they want to. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop this. \nI think it would still happen.",
            "This is a difficult issue. I do not have an opinion on this matter yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a confusing problem. It is hard to solve without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is between government and church. Marriage is a big problem to define. This is because marriage is a special event for some people. They consider it a sacrament. If we look at marriage in this way, people might not get special tax breaks or government help if they are not baptized.\n\nIf two people are married, I think the government should just see it as a civil union. This is because marriage is two people together. The government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is.\n\nSome people think marriage should be between a man and a woman. Others think it should be between two people who love each other. This is a hard problem to solve.\n\nIf all states can agree on what to do, then they should make it a national law. But changing the US Constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The Constitution should not be changed for a small group of people.\n\nThis issue is not big enough to change the Constitution. It is not important enough to make a law that says who can get married and who cannot.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. I respect people with different beliefs. Homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with all of their choices, but I believe they should be free to live as they wish. I don't think it's the government's job to decide. Each state should decide its own laws.\n\nMy friends and I talk about this. Some states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect its decision.\n\nI think gay people should have the same rights as everyone else. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. I don't think the president should make a decision for the whole country.\n\nPresident Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state is run. Each state should be allowed to make its own decisions.\n\nSome things should be up to each individual state. The president's decision is temporary and can be changed by the next president. States will have to live with their own decisions, not the president.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I don’t agree with this idea. Posting on Myspace is a public thing. You post something for everyone to see. If you do that on the internet, people will see it, even school officials. They can see it from their homes.\n\nSchool officials should be able to see what students post online. This can help keep students safe. For example, if they find students posting about drinking or smoking, they can stop them. This is a school’s job: to keep students safe.\n\nBut I don’t think it’s right for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students. If they want to do that, it’s an invasion of privacy. However, if it makes the school safer, that’s okay.\n\nI think it’s a good idea for school officials to go online to make sure students are safe. They can check Myspace to stop students from doing bad things. This is like the school’s drill practice for when there might be a problem.\n\nSchool officials want to keep students safe, like after the Columbine incident. They do this to prevent something bad from happening. I think this is a good thing.",
            "I don't agree with the war in the Middle East. I was personally affected by 9/11. But now I think we should not be there. We did not think about the long-term effects of the war. We went to the war quickly without a good plan. This made things worse for us.\n\nWe should not be in the Middle East. The people there are fighting each other. They cannot fight with us if they cannot agree with themselves. We cannot help them by being there. We went to the war without being prepared. We did not know what we would face.\n\nWar is different in the Middle East. They fight in a way that is not like our way. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave and let them handle their own problems.\n\nWe were not thinking clearly before we went to war. We were angry and wanted revenge. We did not think about what could happen. We just wanted to fight. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq because many people wanted to. But we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not know what we were doing. We did not have unity. We did not know what we wanted to achieve. This made things worse. I think we should not be in the Middle East. We are not making progress. We are hurting ourselves by being there. We cannot stay there forever. When we leave, things will fall apart."

            "Um I think that in a few ways the Catholic Church does need to change \nUm \nTheir views \nI think that a lot of \nThey have been talking about how the Catholic Church is loosing some of its following and I think its because a lot of times the Catholic Church isn’t very accepting of a lot of things \nUm \nWithin the case of I know  \nUm \nLike gay marriages \nWithin the case of abortion \nWithin the case of birth control \nThings like that \nI \nUm \nThe Catholic Church has very \nHas strong views on them which is fine \nBut they have are there views are a little bit old fashioned in some ways \nSo I think that if they were to adapt to maybe a little bit of a newer style of thinking they \nWouldn’t be worried about loosing their following \nUm \nWell I’ve heard there’s a lot of \nUm \nPeople are starting to \nSome people are starting to turn against the Catholic Church a little bit because of their \nUm \nThe way that they see these situations \nAnd \nUm \nPeople are starting to not agree with them on certain subjects \nSo I feel they feel that \nUm \nThat \nThe Catholic Church kinda has the wrong view on things \nYeah \nI mean  \nUm \nThe Catholic Church is against abortion \nSo if you were for abortion you might not be comfortable in a following where that was taught to be completely wrong \nAnd that you were going against it \nUm \nWell \nI mean the same I guess with \nUm  \nGay marriage and things such as that where if that was something that you believed in \nAnd that you wanted to do or even just felt strongly about \nUm \nYou might not \nWant to be in a following where they didn’t agree with that  \nUm \nI don’t see any reason why they can’t have female priests or that priests can’t be married \nBut I don’t know if that necessarily would have prevented what happened \nI mean I don’t know \nEh \nI don’t know if they \nUm \nThey might not have \nJust done that if they \nI mean your right they might not have done that if they were allowed to be married or if there were women priests \nBut I don’t know if that would have necessarily changed it \nUm \nWell I mean that was something they did \nAnd \nThat was something that \nUm \nI don’t know \nThat a whole \nThat was something they did \nAnd it might \nDidn’t really seem to \nBe affected \nI mean \nIf they were married would they have done it differently \nIt’s hard to really tell \nYeah \nUm \nWell I don’t see why there \nPriests can’t be married  \nI mean \nThe Catholic Church really says that the priests are basically married to God \nAnd they’re devoted their complete life \nBut I don’t see \nEveryone else who has a job in the world has their job then they also have their family life \nAnd the other people they are devoted to so I don’t see why priests can’t have both \nNo \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
            "Um \nWell \nA \nMe personally \nI’m not opposed to gay marriage \nUm \nI think \nI mean \nI think \nUm \nWhether you’re born that way or you know whatever \nI don’t think it’s a choice that’s like consciously made \nSo I think that people \nYou know \nGay people shouldn’t be held responsible for their like sexual orientation or whatever \nUm \nSo \nI \nI think \nI think its wrong to \nTo say \nA man and a women can get married but two people of the same sex can’t really \nUm \n(pause) \nI haven’t really put a whole lot of thought into the topic but \nUh um \nYeah I would definitely say its \nits wrong for them to say that \n\nUm \nWell it seems that its \nIts not so much like a choice \nLike they they don’t really have a choice on how they are \nLike um \nI mean \nLike \nI was born straight \nAnd you know another person is born gay I guess \nIt doesn’t seem like it’s a conscious choice that \nThat they should be held responsible for \nIf you know what I mean \n\nUm \n(pause, clears throat) \nAh yeah I would definitely think its wrong to do that \nI don’t really \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved cause its more of a \nUm \nI don’t think its like a legal issue \nI \nI don’t know if I want to call it like a moral issue \nUm \nI mean \nAgain like I don’t think these like gay people should be \nUm \nHow do I say \nAh \nUm \nShould be like put \nLike I mean like \nOn a stage like they’re \nYou know \nLike its wrong \nLike \nLike \nThat they made a wrong decision or choice or whatever \n\nSo I don’t think the federal government really has any say \n\nUm \nIts hard \n\n(laughs) \nUm \nOk \nWell \nUm \nI don’t think the federal government should be involved because its \nI mean its its nothing involving the security of our country it has nothing to do with moral concerns or anything like that its not like \nIt just seems like they’re outta place \nIt doesn’t seem like they have any right to \nTo interject in people’s lives \nAnd \nAnd you know \nThat’s just who they are \nThe \nWho \nWho um \nYou know \nGay people \nThat’s just like how they were born or at least that’s what I think \nAnd I mean its \nThey shouldn’t be punished for that \n\nUh no \nThat’s it \n\n",
            "I think that gay marriage should be legalized \nBecause \nWell basically there’s not a good reason not to \nUm \nMany people think that homosexual couples pose a threat to the heterosexual family \nBut \nIt’s so different \nAnd \nThere’s so many different aspects to it that it could never be considered the same \nIt’s just \nIt’s like two different sides of the same coin \nUm \nHeads will never be tails \nBut \nIt’s like the same thing \nAnd \nUm \nWell there’s a bunch of like civil rights that go along with it \nLike \nProperty taxes and the whole health care thing where \nUm \nYour primary or your \nI don’t want to say next of kin \n\n‘Cause I’m not sure that that’s what it is \nBut \nIf you’re in a gay couple then your partner can’t be in the room with you if you’re sick \nAnd \nCan’t visit \n‘Cause they’re not technically family \n\nAnd \nI think that’s kind of silly if you’re going to spend the rest of your life with someone \nAnd \nA lot of scientific studies have been done \nBecause \nIt’s kind of a hot topic these days \nAnd \nHomosexual couples have like the same kind of rates of success \nThey have the same \nUm \nFactors in the relationship that contribute to satisfaction as heterosexual couples do \n\nIt’s just it’s a relationship it’s the same thing \nAnd \nI think where a lot of people like get hung up on is \nUm \nHomosexuals aren’t asking for the right to get married in a church \nThey’re asking for a marriage certificate \nA legal document provided by the government \n\nAnd \nIf there’s not involvement with church and state then that shouldn’t be an issue \nBecause \nI can’t understand where people like catholics can get hung up on oh well that’s against our religion and that’s morally wrong for us and we can’t approve of that sort of thing \nBut \nIn a legal sense \nIf you’re allowing someone a civil union why not allow them a marriage \n\nIt’s like segregation separate but unequal \n\nYeah \nThey are \nThey’re the same in many ways like the type of relationship roles played by different partners and stuff like that \nAnd \nPeople worry about like adoption issues \nAnd \nCommunity issues \nLike how a gay couple living in their community will affect the community \n\nAnd \nEspecially about \nUm \nChildren of gay couples and how they’ll adjust to society \nAnd \nWhether or not they’ll \nUm \nBe influenced by their parent’s \nUm \nSexual orientation choices or not \nBut \nWell again it’s kind of new and stuff \nBut \nIt’s kind of hard to say \nI’m not sure about the children aspect \nAbout adoption \nBecause \nI think the main drawback to that is \nUm \nHow children get treated by their peers \nAnd \nBy other adults in society \n\nLike in New York City I know they \nUm \nThey have special schools for children of gay parents \nBecause \nIn public schools in New York City they get like beaten up \n\nAnd \nStuff like that \nParents protest to get the child removed from their school \nAnd \nIt’s just a kid \nI mean \nThey’re gonna have the same points of views and everything \nParenting skills are the same in gay couples as in straight couples \n\nAnd \nSo \nThey can be community involved or not like heterosexual couples choose to \nI mean it’s just about personality choices \n\nI think the federal government should be very involved in this issue \nMaking gay marriage legal in every state \nI think the amendment should just be the opposite \n\nBut \nWell I think President Bush has very very strong views of his own having to do with his religion \n\nWell \nHis um \nHis take on gay marriage actually um \nI think it goes along with his take on abortion \nAnd \nStem cell research which \nUm \nI think most of the reasons \nI’m not sure about this \nBecause \nHonestly I try not to pay attention to politics a lot \nBut \nMost of the reasons I’ve heard at least like in the news and stuff are moral reasons \nAnd \nMorality I don’t want to say it’s negotiable \nBut \nIt definitely differs from person to person \nAnd \nTo embrace the morality of a certain group in America while totally ignoring the culture and \nUm \nMorality concepts of all the rest is unethical \nTo just go along with what some religious groups believe without taking into account \nTo go along with what religious groups believe is in government to create an amendment banning gay marriage is completely hypocritical of the government considering the recent controversy \nConsidering I mean about \nUm \nUnder god in the pledge of allegiance \nAnd \nHow people are so opposed to that \nBut \nYet they’ll let laws be made that enforce religious standards on an entire country \n\nUm \nJust one \nLots of people are anti gay and anti gay marriage because they believe that gay people are somehow psychologically damaged \nAnd \nThe gayness has resulted from trauma in their childhood not being close enough to one or the other of the parents \nOr \nJust a personality defect \n\nAnd \nThat is also not a good reason \nBecause \nThe American Psychological Association just put out a memo about how untrue that is \nAnd \nIf people listened to \nUm \nInstitutions that actually did research and studies on these subjects \n\nInstead of listening to their neighbors and their friends \nAnd \nMaybe what’s popular opinion in their culture in their church \nThen maybe the world would be seen a little bit differently \n\nNope \n\n",

            "(laughs) \nUm \nInitially I I was ok with the premise but I think that everyone was still very much reeling from the September 11th attacks and I think that we kind of went in to Iraq as a pretext there were pretexts that led us into Iraq \nI think that early on the Bush administration connected the Iraq war with Osama Bin Laden and to the September 11th attacks and asserted that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction all of which has since proven false \nAnd that’s very much rubbed me against the grain and in general the Iraq war kind of boils my blood \n\nUm \nIt just seems to me that the Bush administration is very openly lied to the American people and has yet to own up to that fact \nEven Colin Powell \nI mean coming back from that big presentation he gave at the UN now says that he really wasn’t convinced by the evidence at the time even when he was presenting it \nAnd \nTo me that’s just malfeasance in office I thinks that’s an impeachable offense to lie to the American people like that \nI think that the Bush administration has a complete disregard for the constitution and has been trying to marginalize it ever since \nWell since September 11th at least I mean \nI think that they \nUm \nThey came into office with the intent to go to war \n\nUm \nThat last part \n\nI forget the name of the \nUm \nSecretary of the treasury who essentially made that allegation in his book after he was probably forced out of his office \nUm \nBut it seems to be that the younger Bush kind of had came in with a blood vengeance kind of feeling against Saddam Hussein because of his dad’s administration and I think that in the long term he was hoping to expand our energy supply too \nWhich is also very underhanded way to do things \n\nWell \nI do think it’s gone on long enough \nI think there would be problems if we withdrew right now though cause there’s a good chance that the country would lapse into civil war and even more people would die as a result \nUm \nI think that the alternative that the UN and the United States are moving to at this point seems to be kind of like \nA coalition of nations from the surrounding area like Syria and Saudi Arabia to come in and try to restore order \nBut I don’t necessarily know that that’s a good idea either because I think in the long term that will also cause more problems because \nUm \nIraq’s sovereignty will come to be an issue \nA major issue there because I think it’s pretty clear that the interim government is dissolving at this point \n\nJust from the news reports I’ve heard it doesn’t seem that the Parliament is very effective at all \nThat um \nOh I can’t remember his name but the Prime Minister really has any kind of control over the political process or what’s happened happening and even Mugtada al-Sadr the guy we were fighting \nI guess it was less then a year ago \nHis party now holds 20 at least 20 seats in the Iraqi Parliament and I mean we’re still dealing with la fractious radical elements who are vying for control of the government \nAnd I think that the political process is experiencing a lot of friction because of that \n\nUm \n(laughs) \nNone that I can articulate in polite company \n\n",
            "I did \nMmhmm \nJust talk into it? \nOk \nOk cool \nUh huh \nUh \nOk I’m sorry \nOk \nHow I feel about the War in Iraq \nLet me see \nUm \nAt this point I feel it’s kind of pointless because I mean it’s not even a declared war actually \nAnd I feel like it was just a big like get back at Iraq thing because that’s who we figured bombed the U.S. \nLike who had did the terrorist attacks on nine eleven \nSo I don’t feel like \nI mean I’m not a big person on the War on Iraq \nSo I don’t like keep up with it \nI don’t know the big details of it \nBut at this point I know that we’re kind of just staying over there to try and just build democracy so that it can become like another U.S. thing \nAnd then also so that we can get oil and stuff from them \nBut it’s no reason for staying over there because it’s making everyone upset \nSo \nAnd then like if we stay over there then what’s gonna end up happening is we have to try and like create democracy which is gonna take forever because democracy can’t be built in just a day \nAnd then if we like leave they’ll be mad at us because we like messed everything up and now they have to start all over again by themselves \nUm \nLet me see \nOhh this is so hard \nThis is the one topic I don’t know anything about \nUm \nWar in Iraq \nOh this hard \nUh \nMmm \nUhh I don’t know \nDo you have anything else I can go off of? \nOk \nThank you \nUm \nWell um \nActually I think \nI think the war should continue because it’s not fair \nI don’t think we should call it a war anymore \nBut because I don’t think that \nYou know \nI think the only reason that we have to use guns and stuff is just to show that \nYou know \nThat we’re big and we’re American and stuff like that and we have all these big guns \nBut I don’t feel like there’s a huge reason for us to like call it a war anymore \nBecause like we didn’t even call it \nIt shouldn’t have even been called a war in the first place \nBecause it never was declared a war by congress \nI think that’s how the whole thing works \nYou have to declare a war by congress \nAnd then it’s \nI just don’t think that it’s a real big point to still stay over there and try \nActually no \nI do think it’s a point to stay over there and try to like help them \nBut it’s also like wasting our resources \nAnd especially like right now I feel so bad for Bush because it’s like \nIt’s making him look like one of the worst presidents of the U.S. right now \nBecause of like what it’s doing and it’s like \nAnd what it’s doing to like \nCause remember \nI think with the whole Vietnam thing \nVietnam War was like undeclared war and it’s now called like a meaningless war \nAnd he’s like saying \nHe’ll be called like that president forever \nThat he started this meaningless war and stuff \nSo \nHuh \nYou have to make this a half an hour don’t you? \nUh \nOk yeah \nUm \nHuh \nI guess you could also say that it is \nLike it’s hard to say that I want the war to end because there’s so many families that I know of that are in \nWhose sons and daughters are in Iraq and it’s like I want it to keep going because of the fact that you know you want them to like \nThese people over there have lives too and we kind of destroyed them because now we took \nI bet some of the kids don’t even have a place to go to school \nAnymore because it’s so like unsafe and all these different like little groups within Iraq that are like killing each other \nJust because of like the different beliefs that they have \nBut then again \nIt’s like \nIt’s hard to say \nI want them in there but it’s like they have such a different culture than we do that if we stay in there we’re going to be trying more and more to mold them into like a second United States \nThat it’s going to be even worse for them \nAnd it’s going to be \nLike I feel like the whole Al-Kaida thing will just grow even more and their hatred towards the U.S. will just grow even more because we’re now trying to change them \nAnd they’ve been going on this whole like \nUm \nTotalitarian \nLike a whole dictatorship thing for so long that \nYou know \nI feel like it’s gonna \nThat it’s kinda hurt us in the end to keep trying to stay there \nSo I think this whole thing is gonna go on for years and years and years \nHmm \nThat’s about it \nOk \n",
            "Uh\nI really don’t feel like \nIt’s right to make it be legal or for a state to even declare it as being legal\nI think it’s really up to the churches because in the constitution it even says separation of church and state\nIt’s a clear\nIt’s a clear\nUh\nIt’s\nClearly stated and I feel that trying to do anything with it\nTrying to enforce any kind of power over it \nWould really be in defiance of what has already been said\nAnd written in stone in the constitution \nSo \nUh\nIn terms of the people that are trying to make it illegal I think that’s really choosing one churches belief over another\nBecause as we can see most of the Catholics\nUh\nCatholics are and Christians are really against it\nAnd don’t support it except for up in Boston and some of those areas \nBut um \nI don’t think that it’s really up to the government to decide what the churches are allowed to and not allowed to make illegal\nAnd legal\n\nUh\nWell separation of church and state is pretty much \nUh like been a key aspect of the constitution\nAnd what’s really allowed for religious tolerance in the United States\nAnd even though they did plan on making an amendment\nI think that even making an amendment about it would be completely wrong\nAnd just in contradictory to what‘s already been said and written there\nAnd plus I also think that it would be one of the only amendment\nProbably I think maybe one of the only amendments that’s actually used to restrict the people rather than restrict the government\nSo I don’t feel that’s its right at all\nIn that aspect \n\nUh\nNo I do not believe that the federal government or any government at all should be involved in this issue\nI don’t see why he’s pushing for this amendment\nExcept that’s it’s against his own personal beliefs as a Catholic\nAnd\nAs I said before his push for this amendment is just showing that he has a preference for a certain religion over like every other religion\nSo I really feel that it is up to the churches to decide this\nNot for the president\nOr anybody in government in particular\nAnd there isn’t really any reason backing it other than personal views as to why there should be an amendment banning it\nBecause I don’t see how it’s going to impact the economy or anything else \nIf anything\nIt could possibly boost it I think by \nI don’t know how but\nI think it might have better impact on the society \nSociety than it would not\n\nUmm\nNot quite\nI think I pretty much said it all\n\n",
            "Ok \nThe war in Iraq \nWell \nTo start from the beginning I don’t think that the government was completely honest with the American people about the reasons for war \nBefore invading Iraq and I think there was \nI think there was an attempt to link the invasion of Iraq to the terrorist attacks of September 11th when in reality one really didn’t have that much to do with the other \nBut the government made it seem that way and played on the emotions of the American people in their outrage against the terrorist attacks of September 11th 2001 and the invasion of Iraq started in 2003 \nUm \nI \nI myself and pretty much against war so \nEspecially to make a preemptive strike I was against that \nUm \nAnd I think that it’s \nThe war in Iraq is kind of \nA \nA repeat in many ways of um \nThe Vietnam War and the government should have learned from past mistakes that they have made with \n\nI mean the \nA tremendous amount of American soldiers have died \n\nAnd that’s horrible and \nWhat they were \nWhat they were doing is that they were taking out \nThey were removing the countries government and I really don’t think the government \nThe American government was prepared for the um \nWhat \nFor the aftermath and the void of power and the chaos that was going to occur \nUm \nAnd here \nAnd the government \nAnd so the United States is removing the Iraqi government and \n\nThey are trying to implant a democratic government and its kind of a similar thing they were trying to do in Vietnam \nThey were trying to push out Communists \nAnd \nAnd uphold or implement \nImplement and uphold democracy \nAnd \nAnd its \nAnd its \nAnd the government \nAnd the US government should have known that it was going to be a long and hard ordeal that probably wasn’t \nThat was not going to be a clear clear victory like it wasn’t like it wasn’t a clear \nI mean it was more of a \nIt was more of a loss in Vietnam because \nBecause \nUm \nBecause there because there are there are \nNo matter how many people may have supported \nNo matter how many Iraqis many have wanted the US to come in and no matter how many Vietnamese may have wanted the US to come in there’s going to be a large number of insurgents and its hard to put them down when when you’re not fighting \nAn actual army \n\nYou’re fighting the citizens the \nSpecific citizens in the country and \nSo \nSo I think \nI think that the government \nSo first of all I think that we shouldn’t have gotten into into war cause I’m against it in pretty much all cases and \nBut if you are going to go to war with the country you need to be \nYou need to plan for all possible outcomes \nI think the government was not as prepared as it should have been \nI mean worst \nAnd \nEither for what would \nReally not plan for what would happen once once they removed the the Iraqi government and \nI mean we’re still there today and almost the end of 2006 and we’re still \nUm \nMany American troops are still dying and \nAnd there still trying to train the Iraqi troops and Iraqi \nAnd the Iraqi police forces to be able to police their own country and it’s a long process and I just think that \nThat that the US government in a way tried to \nWell they weren’t prepared thereself but in a way try to deceive the American people in making them think it would be a \nA \nA short successful stay in Iraq and \nI mean we shouldn’t \nWe’re kinda \nWe’re naïve for believing that because it takes a number of years to implement a new form of government and to and for it to become successful \nI mean in our own country \nDemocracy was a long struggle and to be able to get to the powerful government we are today was a long struggle and there was \nThere was lots of tension and there was civil war and \nUm \nIts just not an easy thing to do and I think the government \nThe US government made it seem like a relatively easy thing to do \nAnd \nUm \nSo \nAnd so \nLet’s see \nThe war in Iraq \n\nWell that’s \nNo that’s \nNo that’s a difficult decision to make because \nThat was \nWell that was kind of my feeling I guess in the election \nLike the Presidential election of 2004 when I was thinking about who I would vote for if I could vote and one of \nUm \nOne of my reasons that I probably would have voted for George Bush was to let him finish what it was that he started and \nAnd so I mean once \nIts really hard cause once you go in there and we’ve been in there for so  long how can we abandon these people \nI mean we’re the ones that took away their government and \nAnd \nAnd their way of life so how can we abandon them \nAbsndon them now so \nSo its probably something that we should \n(coughs)\nExcuse me \nTry to see to to its finish but them again there’s also the consideration of the astronomical amount of American casualties and \nAnd \nAnd how \nAnd how much is is too much to to to keep risking for \nFor a free democratic Iraq \nI mean \nGoing back to the whole reason for invading Iraq \nI mean if we’re\nIf we’re \nIf we’re invading Iraq and making it it a democratic nation why is it just Iraq \nWhy aren’t we doing this to all these other countries and I think the big reason for that is \nIs the \nIs the oil issue\nAnd this is where we are getting our oil from\nAnd it’s usually all about money and controlling resources\nI mean because another one of the predispositions is before going into war was that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction\nAnd no weapons of mass destruction were ever actually found\nAnd yet places like North Korea we actually knew that they had weapons of mass destruction and we are not making any attacks against them\nSo I don’t think the us government is being thorough enough or truthful enough in making there decisions\n\nLet’s see\nUm\nI just hope that it ends soon\nAnd there will be peace there soon\nBut probably not\n\n",
            "Um \nLet’s see \nI’m I’m for um gay marriage \nI always have been \nUm \nI really think its it’s a personal personal preference and uh \nAnd its something that’s been proven more and more now that it could be biological opposed to sociological so to to give people less rights due to something that’s really not any of their control \nUm \nDue to their control \nI think it’s its kinda of inhumane \nAnd uh \nI’ve always been an advocate for for gay marriage \n\nUh I don’t think there’s any \nI I think that politics and government in general shouldn’t have a part in this its its \nYou it’s not even at a state level it’s a personal level it’s a household level \nUm \nYou know my neighborhood at home there’s I think two or three openly gay couples not \nYou know not married or anything because they’re not allowed to \nUm \nBut they they function the same way that any other family would \nYou know they walk the dogs down the street like anybody else would and I think that \nUm \nWith you know \nBush trying to to play God here and interpret interpret the words of of marriage the way that he wants to \nI think its \nI think it’s kind of ridiculous \n\nSure yeah \nI mean I think \nI mean I believe I’ve read and heard from numerous different um publications and and TV reports or newspapers whatever on that It’s its something now that a chemical thing in your brain \nIts something you might be predisposed to be a homosexual \nAs opposed to to growing up and you know maybe with like 4 sisters and you’re the only brother and you know you don’t have a father that doesn’t necessarily have anything to do with it \nSo that would be the biological side opposed to sociological \n\nUm \nWell other other then \nI guess the obvious it’s you know in this \nI think maybe cause marriage is something that \nIf a guy and a girl want to do it they can without telling a single person run off to you know Las Vegas and do it but if two gay people want to do it its going to make the front page of the like the New York Times you know \nUh I think it’s kinda the type of thing it should be a personal private uh sector type thing opposed to \nUm \nAs opposed to public domain and um \nNational \nUm federal domain \n\nUh no \nNo \n\n",

            "Um \nYes I do feel that gender discrimination is still an issue in the United States \nUm \nAnd it \nNot only with women though \nI feel it has to with like the particular field of like work that you’re dealing with \nUm \nI mean for overall I feel that women have it more difficult because there’s the glass roof where even still that there is supposed to be equality most people have a difficult time finding that they could have to work underneath a woman if they’re a man \nJust cause of how society has been raised for so long \nAnd so a lot of times in the work place women will see that there’s a job that they can reach \nAnd they have all of the qualifications for it \nBut maybe the board won’t elect to promote them to that position just because historically it’s not seen that women are usually in like the upper hands of the business world \nAnd um \nI guess the same thing goes for men though \nAnd like other industries like fashion or \nUm being a parent at home \nIt’s really uncommon \nUm \nTo have a parent staying at home who’s the male \nAnd um \nA lot of times people look down upon that because society thinks oh well you’re the male, you should be out working \nYou should be the money maker of your family \nWhy are you staying at home? \nAnd it can be really like hard on them because perhaps it’s always been their dream to be with the children and help raise the children and maybe the wife has the better job \nAnd like it’s working out fine for them \nBut society looks down upon that \nAnd then in the fashion industry \nUm \nA lot of times people won’t really take males seriously if they’re straight \nI don’t know if that really makes sense \nBut I guess it’s cause typically males who are into fashion \nUm \nLike I guess have different styles of life \nAnd so if you have the typical style of life and you’re a male and you’re in the fashion industry \nPeople will be like, well wait how do I really know if like you know what fashion if for a woman \nLike you don’t really don’t know what our case is like \nLike these other guys \nAnd so \nDepending on like what field of work you’re in \nI feel like there is definitely gender discrimination in society in the U.S. \nUm \nTo change it is kind of more difficult because you \nSociety like has a set mindset and obviously we have come a long ways from like the 1800s and leaps and bounds \nBut change is really slow so I feel that like if we continue working at the pace we are now because women are going up into higher positions and becoming CEO’s and they’re getting more accepted in the business world and it’s a slow process \nBut it’s happening and people are starting to accept it more \nAnd just as men who are stay at home Dads \nIt’s becoming more accepted because they realize, oh wait maybe the female does have the better job or she wants to be the one that works \nAnd um \nThen for like fashion people will be like, oh wait maybe they’re listening to like their friends that are females or their wives and stuff \nAnd so they do know like where I’m coming from \nSo I guess you kinda have to in a way promote it by putting out the good qualities of the people who are usually stereotypically \nAre stereotyped against by not being too pushy \nBut um saying like the qualities of them \nBecause if you force it people are going to resist \nAnd I feel that we’re kind of at a good balance where it’s starting to become enforced like that \nSo I don’t really know if there’s anything that we can do right now that isn’t already being done because if you do it too fast it’s like people will resist \nAnd we’ve come a long ways and change takes time \nYes \nUm \nWell I guess they’re probably also discriminated against each other depending on the type of job you have or like where you’re from \nLike if you grew up on a farm and your grammar maybe isn’t the best, but you are extremely intelligent and you go to have yourself \nLike you work your way up into a CEO job \nEven though you might not have the best grammar in the world and \nOr even though you might be intelligent, but you don’t have the best grammar in the world \nOther men might look down upon you and be like well how do I know you’re really what you’re saying if you can’t even put verbs and nouns together right \nSo \nYeah \nSo like sometimes just where you’re from can discriminate against you \nAnd like from gender to gender \nAnd I don’t know \nI guess that’d be another example \nUm \nNot really \n\n",
            "Well \nMy understanding is that they didn’t legalize it \nThey decriminalized it \nUm \nWhich knocked it down from a criminal offense to \nUh \nA \nTo more of like a traffic ticket \nYou know something you just get cited for rather than having to get booked and arrested and brought in and all of that \nUm \nAnd I think that if someone gets caught and gets cited with it than you know for the purposes of job interviews and all sorts of things like that \nUm \nThose types of ramifications which are usually like the worst of having a drug charge would \nI mean usually the worst ramifications of having a drug charge well \nDepending on the charge \nAt least for a marijuana charge \nOne thing that a lot of kids worry about \nA lot of people worry about are the future ramifications and those don’t necessarily go away when it’s decriminalized \nBut at the same time there is an argument that uh \nI mean it costs a lot to arrest people and to bring them in and to book them \nAnd to house them and then to let them go \nAnd then it costs a lot you know to have them come into court once, maybe twice, maybe three times \nAnd then appoint a public defender \nAnd then you have to pay the judge and then the state attorney’s office has to pick up the charge and basically press the charges \nI mean all of that stuff costs a lot to do \nAnd um \nI mean so \nWhen you’re looking at municipalities that are financially in trouble \nI mean a lot of them just philosophically aren’t willing to make that kind of concession \nEven if it would free up a lot of money for then \nLike a lot of communities are rightfully so against marijuana that they don’t want to do that \nBut in a place like Denver where people tend to be more on the kind of open \nI have to use the word liberal \nBut you know what I mean \nKind of uh \nKind of thought track \nThen I think it’s totally fine \nAnd I’m sure that their municipality has a lot more money now that they can spend on public education \nThat they can spend on like social programs for the elderly and that they can spend on \nYou know food programs for the homeless people \nUm \nI mean so \nI think it’s \nIt’s important cause I mean marijuana isn’t something that you just want out and out to be everywhere \nAll over the streets and stuff \nUm \nI mean for a variety of reasons \nBut there’s this whole like financial element to it as well \nOther reasons like? \nWhy it shouldn’t necessarily \nWell no \nI mean I \nI don’t know how I would feel about \nWell because if it were totally like legalized I guess you could make it like cigarettes where it could be sold in gas stations and people would be smoking it everywhere \nThen I mean \nI guess a lot of people would be like smoking and driving \nAnd um \nIt still is like taboo in our society \nIn a lot of places and a lot of contexts \nUh \nTo smoke marijuana \nSo \nTo have it out in the open like that \nI feel like it would just be awkward to a lot of people \nUm \nAnd \nSorry what? \nThe volume on the microphone is kind of low \nUm \nI don’t really know \nUm \nI think in general alcohol has more debilitating effects on your motor skills \nUm \nBut I think in general marijuana for a lot of people has a more adverse effect on their lifestyle \nAs opposed to just their decision making motor skills \nI mean \nBut they \nThey both have their adverse effects \nAnd I mean they \nI feel like when it comes to substances in general \nLike no two people really react the same way \nI mean and then people \nSome people have personalities that are just more normal and they just kind of go balls to wall with everything they have \nAnd then some people know how to exercise moderation and then some people don’t \nSo it \nI guess that makes it really hard to generalize about the substance \nWhen people react different ways \nBut I definitely think that they both have their own adverse effects \nUm yeah \nUh \nNo I don’t \n\n",

            "The Catholic Church needs to make some changes. Many people have been saying this because the Church does not accept some things. Like gay marriages and abortion. The Church has strong views on these topics, but they are old-fashioned in some ways.\n\nIf the Church changed its ideas a little, it would not lose followers. People are turning away from the Church because of its views on these issues. Some people do not agree with the Church on things like this.\n\nFor example, the Church is against abortion. If you support abortion, you will not be comfortable in a Church where it is considered wrong. The same is true for gay marriage. If you believe in it, you might not want to be in a Church that does not agree.\n\nThe Church does not allow women to be priests or priests to be married. This might not have stopped problems in the Church, but it could have helped. Maybe priests would have acted differently if they were allowed to be married or have a family.\n\nThe Church says its priests are married to God and devote their lives to the Church. But other people can have a job and a family life. There is no reason priests cannot have both.",
            "I am not opposed to gay marriage. I think it is not wrong for two people of the same sex to get married. People are born gay. It is not a choice. They should not be held responsible for their sexual orientation. It is not right to say that a man and a woman can get married, but two people of the same sex cannot.\n\nI think it is not a choice. People are born straight or gay. It is not something they can change. I was born straight and I know people are born gay. They should not be blamed for their sexual orientation.\n\nI do not think the federal government should be involved in this issue. It is not a matter of law. It is not a moral issue either. People should be free to be who they are. They should not be judged or punished for being gay.\n\nThe federal government should not interfere with people's personal lives. They should let people make their own choices. Being gay is not a bad thing. It is just a part of who they are.\n\nIn my opinion, the federal government has no right to tell people what to do. They should not try to control people's lives. Gays are people too. They deserve respect and freedom.",

Every couple is different. \n\nGay couples are like heterosexual couples. They have the same kinds of problems and the same kinds of love. \n\nGay couples want a marriage certificate from the government, not a marriage in a church. This should not be a problem. \n\nIt is like segregation. Separate and unequal is not fair. \n\nPeople are worried about adoption and how children will be treated. But this is not a reason to keep gay couples from marrying. \n\nGay parents love their children just like straight parents do. They make the same decisions and have the same feelings. \n\nWe should not judge people based on their choices. We should let them be who they are. \n\nThe government should make sure gay marriage is allowed everywhere. The law should be fair for everyone. \n\nPresident Bush has his own opinions on this issue. He thinks it is against his religion. But the government should not make laws based on one person's opinions. \n\nWe should consider what is fair and what is right. The government should not just follow what some people believe. \n\nSome people think gay people are damaged or have a personality problem. But this is not true. The American Psychological Association says so. We should listen to experts, not just what people think. \n\nWe should treat everyone equally and with respect. This is what we want for our country.",
            "I work in a hospital pharmacy during the summer. You may wonder why I think marijuana should be legal. The reason is simple – a drug being illegal does not mean it has no good effects. While I do not think it should be available to the public, I believe it can be useful for medical purposes.\n\nMany medicines used in pharmacies are illegal, but they are still used because they are helpful. For example, oxycodone and Vicodin are controlled substances, but they are used because they are beneficial. Marijuana may have beneficial effects, but it is not available because of a negative image. I think we should look at the good things marijuana can do and understand it better.\n\nMarijuana and alcohol are not the same. While abusing marijuana can be bad, abusing alcohol can also cause problems. But we can use marijuana responsibly. To do this, we need to change the way people think about marijuana. If we make it legal, people may use it wisely.\n\nThe problem is that many people think marijuana is bad because it is illegal. But it is not as bad as heroine or cocaine. If we can change this image, people may use marijuana responsibly for medical reasons.",
            "I think the church has changed in recent years to become more like the 21st century. It is not as strict as it used to be. When I was young, I went to church on Sundays. I would wear nice dresses, matching shoes, and a matching purse. I attended a private school and saw my friends there on weekends. We would attend the early mass. But now, the church has a special service for teenagers, called a teenager mass. The service is only 30 minutes long. People dress more casually, especially in the summer. Some wear beach clothes right from the beach. Families sometimes arrive late. The church has become more casual, even for morning masses. I used to wear nice clothes, but now people wear jeans and khakis. This is the main thing I have noticed about the church.\n\nAs for other things, that is all I know about the church. I do not know about the politics inside the church. I am not sure about the church's rules and decisions.\n\nI do not think the church's rules about marriage and being a priest would have stopped the problems with pedophilia. There are men who are married but still have these problems. It is not because they are allowed to get married or not that causes the problem, but because of the person themselves. Becoming a priest is a choice, and there are other religions where priests can get married.\n\nI think the problem of pedophilia is based on genetics. People are born with these tendencies, and it is not something they become because of how they are raised. Genetics play a role, and you cannot hide this through marriage. It may come out eventually. The church may not be able to prevent this from happening.\n\nIf the church knew about the problems and tried to cover them up, that would be wrong. But I do not think they knew in all cases. I do not have any other thoughts about the Catholic church.",

The constitution says the government should not choose which churches are good or bad. Most Catholics and Christians do not agree with it. But this should not be a decision for the government to make.\n\nSeparation of church and state is a key part of the United States. It allows for freedom of religion. The government should not make laws about what churches can or cannot do. Even if there was a new law, it would be wrong. It would go against what is already written.\n\nThe government should not be involved in this issue. I don't see why the president is pushing for this law. It's because of his own personal feelings.

The country was in chaos. \n\nThe US government thought it could easily put in a new government and make it work. But, it was not easy. It is not easy to make a new government in any country.

They are trying to help the Iraqi people, but it is a long and hard process. The US government should have thought about this before going to war.\n\nThis is a difficult decision. Once the US went to war, it was hard to leave. The US took control of Iraq and its government. The US should not just leave now. But, the US is losing many soldiers. How many is too many? \n\nWe should think about why the US went to war. The US is not helping all the countries that need help.

Women often have a harder time advancing in their work because of a problem called the \"glass ceiling.\" This means that people may not choose women for higher positions, even if they are qualified. This is because women are not usually in charge in business.\n\nMen also have problems in certain jobs, like working at home with their children. Some people think it is not good for a man to stay home and take care of the children. They think men should work and earn money for their family. But this can be hard for men who want to be with their children and help raise them.\n\nIn the fashion industry, men are not always taken seriously if they like fashion. People may think that men who like fashion are not like other men. They may not understand what men in the fashion industry are doing.\n\nBut I think things are getting better. More women are becoming successful in business and are being accepted as leaders. And more men are staying home to take care of their children. This is good because it shows that people are changing their minds.\n\nTo make things fairer, we need to show that everyone has good qualities, not just the ones that people expect. If we do not push too hard, people will not resist the change. We should just show the good qualities of people who are different.\n\nWe have made a lot of progress, and change takes time. I think we are at a good point where people are starting to accept differences.\n\nPeople can also be discriminated against because of where they are from or how they talk. For example, if someone has poor grammar but is very smart, people may not believe what they say. This can happen to men and women.",
            "I think I understand the situation. They made marijuana use not a crime. This means that people who use it will not go to jail. Instead, they will get a ticket, like a traffic ticket. This can be a problem for people who want a job or other opportunities. It can affect their lives in many ways.\n\nSome people think that making marijuana use not a crime saves money. It costs a lot to arrest people, take them to court, and pay for lawyers and judges. When towns have little money, they may not want to do this.\n\nHowever, in some places, like Denver, people are open-minded about marijuana. They think it is okay to use it. This town has more money now to spend on good things, like education and help for the elderly and homeless people.\n\nBut there are reasons why marijuana should not be everywhere. It is not good to have people smoking it and driving. And in many places, people do not like it. They think it is not right to use it openly.\n\nAlcohol can hurt people's driving skills. Marijuana can hurt people's lives in other ways, like how they act and think. But people are different, and they react to things in different ways.\n\nSo, it is hard to say how marijuana affects people. But it can be bad for some people. We should be careful about how we use it.",
            "I agree with the things they do. \nBecause \nThey have done them for a long time. \nTheir customs are good, but it is also important to change. \nI think so. \n\nMany Catholics go to church every week. \nThey have rules about how things are done. \nSometimes I feel that the Catholic Church does not accept people who do not follow the rules. \nThey also do not accept people from other religions. \n\nFor example, my parents were different religions. \nMy mother was Catholic and my father was Episcopalian. \nThe Catholic Church would not marry them. \nThis is not being kind to others. \nCatholics learn to love others. \nBut it is not kind to not accept others. \n\nI do not think that changing one thing would help. \nFor example, if priests could get married, some might still hurt children. \nThis is not because they are married, but because they want to hurt children. \n\nPeople who hurt children will do it anyway. \nIt is not because they are married. \nThey will hurt children because they want to. \n\nI do not think allowing priests to marry would stop this. \nI think it would still happen.",
            "This is a difficult issue. I do not have an opinion on this matter yet. I do not know if either side is right or wrong. This is a confusing problem. It is hard to solve without hurting someone's feelings.\n\nThe issue is between government and church. Marriage is a big problem to define. This is because marriage is a special event for some people. They consider it a sacrament. If we look at marriage in this way, people might not get special tax breaks or government help if they are not baptized.\n\nIf two people are married, I think the government should just see it as a civil union. This is because marriage is two people together. The government should not ask about the kind of marriage it is.\n\nSome people think marriage should be between a man and a woman. Others think it should be between two people who love each other. This is a hard problem to solve.\n\nIf all states can agree on what to do, then they should make it a national law. But changing the US Constitution to ban gay marriage is not a good idea. The Constitution should not be changed for a small group of people.\n\nThis issue is not big enough to change the Constitution. It is not important enough to make a law that says who can get married and who cannot.",
            "I grew up in a Christian home. I respect people with different beliefs. Homosexuality is a complicated issue for me. I have many gay friends. I don't agree with all of their choices, but I believe they should be free to live as they wish. I don't think it's the government's job to decide. Each state should decide its own laws.\n\nMy friends and I talk about this. Some states are democratic and some are republican. Democratic states are more likely to support gay marriage. If you live in a state that allows gay marriage, you should respect its decision.\n\nI think gay people should have the same rights as everyone else. Each state should decide whether to allow gay marriage. I don't think the president should make a decision for the whole country.\n\nPresident Bush does not live in every state. He should not decide how each state is run. Each state should be allowed to make its own decisions.\n\nSome things should be up to each individual state. The president's decision is temporary and can be changed by the next president. States will have to live with their own decisions, not the president.\n\nI don't think so.",
            "I don’t agree with this idea. Posting on Myspace is a public thing. You post something for everyone to see. If you do that on the internet, people will see it, even school officials. They can see it from their homes.\n\nSchool officials should be able to see what students post online. This can help keep students safe. For example, if they find students posting about drinking or smoking, they can stop them. This is a school’s job: to keep students safe.\n\nBut I don’t think it’s right for school officials to go on the internet just to catch students. If they want to do that, it’s an invasion of privacy. However, if it makes the school safer, that’s okay.\n\nI think it’s a good idea for school officials to go online to make sure students are safe. They can check Myspace to stop students from doing bad things. This is like the school’s drill practice for when there might be a problem.\n\nSchool officials want to keep students safe, like after the Columbine incident. They do this to prevent something bad from happening. I think this is a good thing.",
            "I don't agree with the war in the Middle East. I was personally affected by 9/11. But now I think we should not be there. We did not think about the long-term effects of the war. We went to the war quickly without a good plan. This made things worse for us.\n\nWe should not be in the Middle East. The people there are fighting each other. They cannot fight with us if they cannot agree with themselves. We cannot help them by being there. We went to the war without being prepared. We did not know what we would face.\n\nWar is different in the Middle East. They fight in a way that is not like our way. They do not want to make their country better. They just want us to leave. We should leave and let them handle their own problems.\n\nWe were not thinking clearly before we went to war. We were angry and wanted revenge. We did not think about what could happen. We just wanted to fight. President Bush wanted to declare war on Iraq because many people wanted to. But we should have had a better plan.\n\nWe did not know what we were doing. We did not have unity. We did not know what we wanted to achieve. This made things worse. I think we should not be in the Middle East. We are not making progress. We are hurting ourselves by being there. We cannot stay there forever. When we leave, things will fall apart."
